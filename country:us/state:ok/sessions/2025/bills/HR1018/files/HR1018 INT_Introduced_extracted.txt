9 investigative agency of the state and for its service
to the citizens of Oklahoma.
10
11
12 WHEREAS, in 1924, Deputy United States Marshal Bill Tilghman was
13 shot in the line of duty, and in 1925, Governor Martin Edwin Trapp
14 recommended the creation of an agency of special investigators to
15 combat outlaws within the state, ultimately fulfilling the concept
16 that Deputy United States Marshal Bill Tilghman had put forth in
17 prior years; and
18 WHEREAS, the State Bureau of Criminal Identification and
19 Investigation, now known as the Oklahoma State Bureau of
20 Investigation, was created on March 28, 1925. The Oklahoma
21 Legislature appropriated Seventy-eight Thousand Dollars ($78,000.00)
22 to the State Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation in
23 its first year; and
24
Req. No. 13355 Page 1
1 WHEREAS, one year after its creation, the State Bureau of
2 Criminal Identification and Investigation was credited with reducing
3 the number of bank robberies in the state by seventy-five percent
4 (75%). Agents accomplished this impressive feat by developing leads
5 while using informants. The use of informants was an investigative
6 technique considered innovative by many experts across the nation.
7 These early years established the State Bureau of Criminal
8 Identification and Investigation as the premier investigative law
9 enforcement agency in Oklahoma, a foundation that has stood the test
10 of time for a century; and
11 WHEREAS, in 1939, the State Bureau of Criminal Identification
12 and Investigation became a division of the Department of Public
13 Safety and was renamed the State Crime Bureau. This arrangement
14 lasted until 1957, when it was placed under the direct control of
15 the Office of the Governor and renamed the Oklahoma State Bureau of
16 Investigation (OSBI); and
17 WHEREAS, the OSBI remained under the direct control of the
18 Governor until 1976, when state leaders sought ways to reduce
19 political pressures due to the OSBI being tasked with numerous
20 political investigations. The Oklahoma Legislature created a seven-
21 member, independent commission to oversee the activities of the
22 OSBI; and
23 WHEREAS, a unique aspect of the OSBI is its limited
24 jurisdiction. This keeps the OSBI from launching its own
Req. No. 13355 Page 2
1 inve stigations without a lawful request. With a few exceptions in
2 which the OSBI does have original jurisdiction, most investigations
3 are initiated at the request of another law enforcement agency or a
4 governmental entity. The OSBI has original jurisdiction in the
5 following areas: vehicle theft, oil field theft, threats against
6 public officials, violations of the Oklahoma Computer Crimes Act,
7 and violent crimes committed on the turnpikes of the state; and
8 WHEREAS, created in 1953, the Criminalistics Services Division
9 of the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation provides a multitude
10 of forensic science services to law enforcement agencies operating
11 within Oklahoma. The Criminalistics Services Division provides
12 services out of two strategically located laboratories throughout
13 the state, with locations in Tahlequah and Edmond. In addition,
14 forensic evidence can be submitted at facilities in McAlester,
15 Lawton, and Woodward; and
16 WHEREAS, the Forensic Science Center (FSC) in Edmond, a state-
17 of-the-art, eighty-thousand-square-foot facility, was completed in
18 May of 2008. The location of the FSC allows the OSBI to partner
19 with professors and students in the Forensic Science program at the
20 University of Central Oklahoma. This partnership creates
21 opportunities for continued training of our scientists by members of
22 academia, education of students by our forensic professionals, and
23 internships for students; and
24
Req. No. 13355 Page 3
1 WHEREAS, the OSBI is also the central repository for all
2 criminal records in Oklahoma and is responsible for collecting data
3 ranging from statewide crime statistics to information for criminal
4 history checks. From processing state and national criminal record
5 check requests, to producing statistical publications, to issuing
6 licenses under the Oklahoma Self-Defense Act, the OSBI helps
7 protect, inform, and support the public and law enforcement.
8 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
9 OF THE 1ST SESSION OF THE 60TH OKLAHOMA LEGISLATURE:
10 THAT for one hundred (100) years, the OSBI has been utilizing
11 creative and innovative investigative techniques and, with the
12 expertise of experienced agents, solved the most serious crimes in
13 Oklahoma.
14 THAT with respect to technology and scientific capabilities, the
15 OSBI leverages cutting-edge investigative techniques including, but
16 not limited to, digital and video forensics, Rapid DNA analysis,
17 drones, forensic genetic genealogy, advanced latent evidence methods
18 such as vacuum metal deposition and RECOVER, 3D crime scene
19 scanning, and the FastTRAX NIBIN investigative lead program for
20 ballistic comparisons, to carry on the tradition of proudly serving
21 the citizens of Oklahoma as the premier law enforcement
22 investigative agency of the state.
