SECTION 4. NEW LAW A new section of law to be codified
10
11
in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 2-7-504 of Title 27A, unless
11
12
there is created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:
12
13
A. A person or entity seeking to receive, store, treat, or
13
14
dispose of more than two hundred (200) pounds of aqueous film-
14
15
forming foam (AFFF) waste per day shall submit an application to the
15
16
Department of Environmental Quality and receive authorization for
16
17
such action. The Department, in the exercise of its reasonable
17
18
discretion, may waive specific requirements of this act or rules
18
19
where there is no feasible alternative to the storage, treatment, or
19
20
disposal at issue and the action does not result in a greater risk
20
21
to human health and the environment. Prior to the promulgation of

6
7
C. 1. AFFF waste generated in or transported from another
7
8
state shall maintain the same classification or characterization it
8
9
would receive in the state of origin, unless such classification or
9
10
characterization is less protective of human health and the
10
11
environment than the classification or characterization it would
11
12
have received if generated in this state.
12
13
2. If AFFF waste generated in or transported from another state
13
14
is banned from disposal in the state of origin, then the waste is
14
15
similarly banned from disposal in Oklahoma, unless the AFFF waste is
15
16
effectively banned from disposal in the state of origin due to a
16
17
lack of permitted hazardous waste landfills within the state. If
17
18
the AFFF waste is effectively banned from disposal in the state of
18
19
origin due to a lack of permitted hazardous waste landfills within
19
20
the state, then the AFFF waste may be disposed of in landfills
20
21
permitted under the Oklahoma Hazardous Waste Management Act pursuant
21
22
to Section 2-7-101 et seq. of Title 27A of the Oklahoma Statutes.
22
