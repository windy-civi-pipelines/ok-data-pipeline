b. The court shall set a second review hearing after the
completion of the counseling or treatment to assure
the attendance and compliance of the defendant with

may suspend sentencing of the defendant until the
defendant has presented proof to the court of
enrollment in a program of treatment for domestic
abuse by an individual licensed practitioner or a
domestic abuse treatment program certified by the
Attorney General and attendance at weekly sessions of
such program. Such proof shall be presented to the
court by the defendant no later than one hundred
twenty (120) days after the defendant is ordered to
such counseling or treatment. At such time, the court
may complete sentencing, beginning the period of the
sentence from the date that proof of enrollment is
presented to the court, and schedule reviews as
required by subparagraphs a and b of this paragraph
and paragraphs 4 and 5 of this subsection. The court
shall retain continuing jurisdiction over the
defendant during the course of ordered counseling
through the final review hearing;

court determines necessary to assure the defendant attends and fully
complies with the provisions of this subsection and the domestic

ENR. H. B. NO. 1413 Page 9

5. At any review hearing, if the defendant is not
satisfactorily attending individual counseling or a domestic abuse
counseling or treatment program or is not in compliance with any
domestic abuse counseling or treatment requirements, the court may
order the defendant to further or continue counseling, treatment, or
other necessary services. The court may revoke all or any part of a
suspended sentence, deferred sentence, or probation pursuant to
Section 991b of this title and subject the defendant to any or all
remaining portions of the original sentence;
6. At the first review hearing, the court shall require the
defendant to appear in court. Thereafter, for any subsequent review
hearings, the court may accept a report on the progress of the
defendant from individual counseling, domestic abuse counseling, or
the treatment program. There shall be no requirement for the victim
to attend review hearings; and
7. If funding is available, a referee may be appointed and
assigned by the presiding judge of the district court to hear
designated cases set for review under this subsection. Reasonable
compensation for the referees shall be fixed by the presiding judge.
The referee shall meet the requirements and perform all duties in
the same manner and procedure as set forth in Sections 1-8-103 and
2-2-702 of Title 10A of the Oklahoma Statutes pertaining to referees
appointed in juvenile proceedings.
E. Emergency temporary, ex parte and final protective orders
shall include notice of these penalties.
F. When a minor child violates the provisions of any protective
order, the violation shall be heard in a juvenile proceeding and the
court may order the child and the parent or parents of the child to
participate in family counseling services necessary to bring about
the cessation of domestic abuse against the victim and may order
community service hours to be performed in lieu of any fine or
imprisonment authorized by this section.
G. Any district court of this state and any judge thereof shall
be immune from any liability or prosecution for issuing an order
that requires a defendant to:
1. Attend a treatment program for domestic abusers certified by
the Attorney General;

2. Attend counseling or treatment services ordered as part of
any final protective order or for any violation of a protective
order; and

attendance by a treatment program for domestic abusers certified by
the Attorney General.
H. At no time, under any proceeding, may a person protected by
a protective order be held to be in violation of that protective
order. Only a defendant against whom a protective order has been
issued may be held to have violated the order.
I. In addition to any other penalty specified by this section,
the court may order a defendant to use an active, real-time, twenty-
four-hour Global Positioning System (GPS) monitoring device as a
condition of a sentence. The court may further order the defendant
to pay costs and expenses related to the GPS device and monitoring.
J. Any pleas of guilty or nolo contendere or finding of guilt
to a violation of any provision of this section shall constitute a
conviction of the offense for the purpose of any subsection of this
section under which the existence of a prior conviction is relevant
for a period of ten (10) years following the completion of any
sentence or court imposed probationary term.
SECTION 3. This act shall become effective November 1, 2025.
