1 D. 1. Any security interest in a vehicle properly perfected
2 prior to July 1, 1979, may be continued as to its effectiveness or
3 duration as provided by Sections 1-9-510 and 1-9-515 of Title 12A of
4 the Oklahoma Statutes, or may be terminated, assigned, or released
5 as provided by Sections 1-9-512, 1-9-513, and 1-9-514 of Title 12A
6 of the Oklahoma Statutes, as fully as if this section had not been
7 enacted, or, at the option of the secured party, may also be
8 perfected under this section, and, if so perfected, the time of
9 perfection under this section shall be the date the security
10 interest was originally perfected under the prior law.
11 2. Upon request of the secured party, the debtor or any other
12 holder of the certificate of title shall surrender the certificate
13 of title to the secured party and shall do such other acts as may be
14 required to perfect the security interest under this section.
15 E. If a manufactured home is permanently affixed to real
16 estate, an Oklahoma certificate of title may be surrendered to
17 Service Oklahoma or a licensed operator for cancellation. When the
18 document of title is surrendered, the owner shall provide the legal
19 description or the appropriate tract or parcel number of the real
20 estate and other information as may be required on a form provided
21 by Service Oklahoma. Service Oklahoma may not cancel a document of
22 title if a lien has been registered or recorded. Service Oklahoma
23 or the licensed operator shall notify the owner and any lienholder
24 that the title has been surrendered to Service Oklahoma and that
SB527 HFLR Page 9
BOLD FACE denotes Committee Amendments.

1 Serv ice Oklahoma may not cancel the title until the lien is
2 released. Such notification shall include a description of the lien
3 and such notification to the owner shall be accompanied by the
4 return of title surrendered. Permanent attachment to real estate
5 does not affect the validity of a lien recorded or registered with
6 Service Oklahoma before the document of title is canceled pursuant
7 to this section. The rights of a prior lienholder pursuant to a
8 security agreement or the provisions of a credit transaction and the
9 rights of the state pursuant to a tax lien are preserved. Service
10 Oklahoma or the licensed operator shall forward the information to
11 the county assessor of the county where the real estate is located
12 and indicate whether the original document of title has been
13 canceled. A fee of Five Dollars ($5.00) shall accompany the
14 application for cancellation of title. When the fee is paid by a
15 person making an application directly with Service Oklahoma, the fee
16 shall be deposited in the Oklahoma Tax Commission Revolving Fund.
17 Beginning January 1, 2023, the fee shall be deposited in the Service
18 Oklahoma Revolving Fund. A fee paid to a licensed operator shall be
19 retained by the licensed operator. The owner of a manufactured home
20 upon which the document of title has been properly surrendered may
21 apply to Service Oklahoma for issuance of a new original certificate
22 of title upon submission of:
23
24
SB527 HFLR Page 10
BOLD FACE denotes Committee Amendments.

1 1. An attestation from the homeowner indicating ownership of
2 the manufactured home and the nonexistence of any security interest
3 or lien of record in the manufactured home; and
4 2. A title opinion by a licensed attorney, determining that the
5 owner of the manufactured home has marketable title to the real
6 property upon which the manufactured home is located and that no
7 documents filed of record in the county clerk’s office concerning
8 the real property contain a mortgage, recorded financial statement,
9 judgment, or lien of record. Persons or entities to whom the title
10 opinion is addressed may rely on the title opinion. A security
11 interest in a manufactured home perfected pursuant to this section
12 shall have priority over a conflicting interest of a mortgagee or
13 other lien encumbrancer, or the owner of the real property upon
14 which the manufactured home became affixed or otherwise permanently
15 attached. The holder of the security interest in the manufactured
16 home, upon default, may remove the manufactured home from such real
17 property. The holder of the security interest in the manufactured
18 home shall reimburse the owner of the real property who is not the
19 debtor and who has not otherwise agreed to access the real property
20 for the cost of repair of any physical injury to the real property,
21 but shall not be liable for any diminution in value to the real
22 property caused by the removal of the manufactured home, trespass,
23 or any other damages caused by the removal. The debtor shall notify
24 the holder of the security interest in the manufactured home of the
SB527 HFLR Page 11
BOLD FACE denotes Committee Amendments.

1 stre et address, if any, and the legal description of the real
2 property upon which the manufactured home is affixed or otherwise
3 permanently attached and shall sign such other documents, including
4 any appropriate mortgage, as may reasonably be requested by the
5 holder of such security interest.
6 F. In the case of motor vehicles or trailers, notwithstanding
7 any other provision of law, a transaction does not create a sale or
8 security interest merely because it provides that the rental price
9 is permitted or required to be adjusted under the agreement either
10 upward or downward by reference to the amount realized upon sale or
11 other disposition of the motor vehicle or trailer.
12 G. A security interest in vehicles registered by a federally
13 recognized Indian tribe shall be deemed valid under Oklahoma law if
14 validly perfected under the applicable tribal law and the lien is
15 noted on the face of the tribal certificate of title.
16 SECTION 2. This act shall become effective July 1, 2025.
17 SECTION 3. It being immediately necessary for the preservation
18 of the public peace, health or safety, an emergency is hereby
19 declared to exist, by reason whereof this act shall take effect and
20 be in full force from and after its passage and approval.
