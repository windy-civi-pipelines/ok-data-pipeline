5 enacted, or, at the option of the secured party, may also be
6 perfected under this section, and, if so perfected, the time of

17 description or the appropriate tract or parcel number of the real
18 estate and other information as may be required on a form provided

24 released. Such notification shall include a description of the lien
Req. No. 1710 Page 9
1 and such notification to the owner shall be accompanied by the
2 return of title surrendered. Permanent attachment to real estate
3 does not affect the validity of a lien recorded or registered with
4 Service Oklahoma before the document of title is canceled pursuant
5 to this section. The rights of a prior lienholder pursuant to a
6 security agreement or the provisions of a credit transaction and the
7 rights of the state pursuant to a tax lien are preserved. Service
8 Oklahoma or the licensed operator shall forward the information to
9 the county assessor of the county where the real estate is located
10 and indicate whether the original document of title has been
11 canceled. A fee of Five Dollars ($5.00) shall accompany the
12 application for cancellation of title. When the fee is paid by a
13 person making an application directly with Service Oklahoma, the fee
14 shall be deposited in the Oklahoma Tax Commission Revolving Fund.
15 Beginning January 1, 2023, the fee shall be deposited in the Service
16 Oklahoma Revolving Fund. A fee paid to a licensed operator shall be
17 retained by the licensed operator. The owner of a manufactured home
18 upon which the document of title has been properly surrendered may
19 apply to Service Oklahoma for issuance of a new original certificate
20 of title upon submission of:
21 1. An attestation from the homeowner indicating ownership of
22 the manufactured home and the nonexistence of any security interest
23 or lien of record in the manufactured home; and
24
Req. No. 1710 Page 10
1 2. A title opinion by a licensed attorney, determining that the
2 owner of the manufactured home has marketable title to the real
3 property upon which the manufactured home is located and that no
4 documents filed of record in the county clerk’s office concerning
5 the real property contain a mortgage, recorded financial statement,
6 judgment, or lien of record. Persons or entities to whom the title
7 opinion is addressed may rely on the title opinion. A security
8 interest in a manufactured home perfected pursuant to this section
9 shall have priority over a conflicting interest of a mortgagee or
10 other lien encumbrancer, or the owner of the real property upon
11 which the manufactured home became affixed or otherwise permanently
12 attached. The holder of the security interest in the manufactured
13 home, upon default, may remove the manufactured home from such real
14 property. The holder of the security interest in the manufactured
15 home shall reimburse the owner of the real property who is not the
16 debtor and who has not otherwise agreed to access the real property
17 for the cost of repair of any physical injury to the real property,
18 but shall not be liable for any diminution in value to the real
19 property caused by the removal of the manufactured home, trespass,
20 or any other damages caused by the removal. The debtor shall notify
21 the holder of the security interest in the manufactured home of the
22 street address, if any, and the legal description of the real
23 property upon which the manufactured home is affixed or otherwise
24 permanently attached and shall sign such other documents, including
Req. No. 1710 Page 11
1 any appropriate mortgage, as may reasonably be requested by the
2 holder of such security interest.
3 F. In the case of motor vehicles or trailers, notwithstanding
4 any other provision of law, a transaction does not create a sale or
5 security interest merely because it provides that the rental price
6 is permitted or required to be adjusted under the agreement either
7 upward or downward by reference to the amount realized upon sale or
8 other disposition of the motor vehicle or trailer.
9 G. A security interest in vehicles registered by a federally
10 recognized Indian tribe shall be deemed valid under Oklahoma law if
11 validly perfected under the applicable tribal law and the lien is
12 noted on the face of the tribal certificate of title.
13 SECTION 2. REPEALER 47 O.S. 2021, Section 1110, as last
14 amended by Section 1, Chapter 323, O.S.L. 2024 (47 O.S. Supp. 2024,
15 Section 1110), is hereby repealed.
16 SECTION 3. This act shall become effective July 1, 2025.
17 SECTION 4. It being immediately necessary for the preservation
18 of the public peace, health or safety, an emergency is hereby
19 declared to exist, by reason whereof this act shall take effect and
20 be in full force from and after its passage and approval.

1 application for a new certificate of title and the
2 proper fees.
3 Upon receiving such affidavit that the security interest has been
4 satisfied, Service Oklahoma shall issue a new certificate of title
5 eliminating the satisfied security interest and the name and address
6 of the secured parties who have been paid and satisfied. Service
7 Oklahoma shall accept a release of a security interest in any form
8 that identifies the debtor, the secured party, and the vehicle, and
9 contains the signature of the secured party. Service Oklahoma shall
10 not require any particular form for the release of a security
11 interest.
12 The words “security interest” when used in the Oklahoma Vehicle
13 License and Registration Act do not include liens dependent upon
14 possession.
15 C. Service Oklahoma shall file and index certificates of title
16 so that at all times it will be possible to trace a certificate of
17 title to the vehicle designated therein, identify the lien entry
18 form, and the names and addresses of secured parties, or their
19 assignees, so that all or any part of such information may be made
20 readily available to those who make legitimate inquiry of Service
21 Oklahoma as to the existence or nonexistence of security interest in
22 the vehicle.
23 D. 1. Any security interest in a vehicle properly perfected
24 prior to July 1, 1979, may be continued as to its effectiveness or
Req. No. 1710 Page 8

1 dura tion as provided by Sections 1-9-510 and 1-9-515 of Title 12A of
2 the Oklahoma Statutes, or may be terminated, assigned, or released
3 as provided by Sections 1-9-512, 1-9-513, and 1-9-514 of Title 12A
4 of the Oklahoma Statutes, as fully as if this section had not been
5 enacted, or, at the option of the secured party, may also be
6 perfected under this section, and, if so perfected, the time of
7 perfection under this section shall be the date the security
8 interest was originally perfected under the prior law.
9 2. Upon request of the secured party, the debtor or any other
10 holder of the certificate of title shall surrender the certificate
11 of title to the secured party and shall do such other acts as may be
12 required to perfect the security interest under this section.
13 E. If a manufactured home is permanently affixed to real
14 estate, an Oklahoma certificate of title may be surrendered to
15 Service Oklahoma or a licensed operator for cancellation. When the
16 document of title is surrendered, the owner shall provide the legal
17 description or the appropriate tract or parcel number of the real
18 estate and other information as may be required on a form provided
19 by Service Oklahoma. Service Oklahoma may not cancel a document of
20 title if a lien has been registered or recorded. Service Oklahoma
21 or the licensed operator shall notify the owner and any lienholder
22 that the title has been surrendered to Service Oklahoma and that
23 Service Oklahoma may not cancel the title until the lien is
24 released. Such notification shall include a description of the lien
Req. No. 1710 Page 9

1 and such notification to the owner shall be accompanied by the
2 return of title surrendered. Permanent attachment to real estate
3 does not affect the validity of a lien recorded or registered with
4 Service Oklahoma before the document of title is canceled pursuant
5 to this section. The rights of a prior lienholder pursuant to a
6 security agreement or the provisions of a credit transaction and the
7 rights of the state pursuant to a tax lien are preserved. Service
8 Oklahoma or the licensed operator shall forward the information to
9 the county assessor of the county where the real estate is located
10 and indicate whether the original document of title has been
11 canceled. A fee of Five Dollars ($5.00) shall accompany the
12 application for cancellation of title. When the fee is paid by a
13 person making an application directly with Service Oklahoma, the fee
14 shall be deposited in the Oklahoma Tax Commission Revolving Fund.
15 Beginning January 1, 2023, the fee shall be deposited in the Service
16 Oklahoma Revolving Fund. A fee paid to a licensed operator shall be
17 retained by the licensed operator. The owner of a manufactured home
18 upon which the document of title has been properly surrendered may
19 apply to Service Oklahoma for issuance of a new original certificate
20 of title upon submission of:
21 1. An attestation from the homeowner indicating ownership of
22 the manufactured home and the nonexistence of any security interest
23 or lien of record in the manufactured home; and
24
Req. No. 1710 Page 10

1 2. A title opinion by a licensed attorney, determining that the
2 owner of the manufactured home has marketable title to the real
3 property upon which the manufactured home is located and that no
4 documents filed of record in the county clerk’s office concerning
5 the real property contain a mortgage, recorded financial statement,
6 judgment, or lien of record. Persons or entities to whom the title
7 opinion is addressed may rely on the title opinion. A security
8 interest in a manufactured home perfected pursuant to this section
9 shall have priority over a conflicting interest of a mortgagee or
10 other lien encumbrancer, or the owner of the real property upon
11 which the manufactured home became affixed or otherwise permanently
12 attached. The holder of the security interest in the manufactured
13 home, upon default, may remove the manufactured home from such real
14 property. The holder of the security interest in the manufactured
15 home shall reimburse the owner of the real property who is not the
16 debtor and who has not otherwise agreed to access the real property
17 for the cost of repair of any physical injury to the real property,
18 but shall not be liable for any diminution in value to the real
19 property caused by the removal of the manufactured home, trespass,
20 or any other damages caused by the removal. The debtor shall notify
21 the holder of the security interest in the manufactured home of the
22 street address, if any, and the legal description of the real
23 property upon which the manufactured home is affixed or otherwise
24 permanently attached and shall sign such other documents, including
Req. No. 1710 Page 11

1 any appropriate mortgage, as may reasonably be requested by the
2 holder of such security interest.
3 F. In the case of motor vehicles or trailers, notwithstanding
4 any other provision of law, a transaction does not create a sale or
5 security interest merely because it provides that the rental price
6 is permitted or required to be adjusted under the agreement either
7 upward or downward by reference to the amount realized upon sale or
8 other disposition of the motor vehicle or trailer.
9 G. A security interest in vehicles registered by a federally
10 recognized Indian tribe shall be deemed valid under Oklahoma law if
11 validly perfected under the applicable tribal law and the lien is
12 noted on the face of the tribal certificate of title.
13 SECTION 2. REPEALER 47 O.S. 2021, Section 1110, as last
14 amended by Section 1, Chapter 323, O.S.L. 2024 (47 O.S. Supp. 2024,
15 Section 1110), is hereby repealed.
16 SECTION 3. This act shall become effective July 1, 2025.
17 SECTION 4. It being immediately necessary for the preservation
18 of the public peace, health or safety, an emergency is hereby
19 declared to exist, by reason whereof this act shall take effect and
20 be in full force from and after its passage and approval.
