which the lien is placed pursuant to an agreement by
9
10
the lender and any party to the title,
10
11
b. to a trust created by a person whose name is included
11
12
on the loan for which the lien is placed, or

14
15
The provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to release

after the satisfaction of the security interest, furnish directly or
19
20
by mail a release of a security interest to Service Oklahoma and
20

the secured party shall also, within seven (7) business days after

Req. No. 1004 Page 6

such satisfaction, mail an additional copy of the release to the

dealer. If the secured party fails to furnish the release as

lienholder of written communication demanding the release of the
6
7
lien, thereafter the penalty shall increase to One Hundred Dollars
7
8
($100.00) per day for each additional day beyond seven (7) business
8
9
days until accumulating to One Thousand Five Hundred Dollars
9
10
($1,500.00) or the value of the vehicle, whichever is less, and, in
10
11
addition, any loss caused to the debtor by such failure.
11
12

Section 13:
2. Upon release of a security interest the owner may obtain a
12
13
new certificate of title omitting reference to the security
13
14
interest, by submitting to Service Oklahoma or to a licensed
14
15
operator:
15
16
a. a release signed by the secured party, an application
16
17
for new certificate of title and the proper fees, or
17
18
b. by submitting to Service Oklahoma or the licensed
18
19
operator an affidavit, supported by such documentation
19
20
as Service Oklahoma may require, by the owner on a
20
21
form prescribed by Service Oklahoma stating that the
21
22
security interest has been satisfied and stating the
22
23
reasons why a release cannot be obtained, an
23
24
24
Req. No. 1004 Page 7

application for a new certificate of title and the

proper fees.
2

Upon receiving such affidavit that the security interest has been
3
4
satisfied, Service Oklahoma shall issue a new certificate of title
4
5
eliminating the satisfied security interest and the name and address
5
6
of the secured parties who have been paid and satisfied. Service
6
7
Oklahoma shall accept a release of a security interest in any form
7
8
that identifies the debtor, the secured party, and the vehicle, and
8
9
contains the signature of the secured party. Service Oklahoma shall
9
10
not require any particular form for the release of a security
10
11
interest.
11
12
The words “security interest” when used in the Oklahoma Vehicle
12
13
License and Registration Act do not include liens dependent upon
13
14
possession.
14
15
C. Service Oklahoma shall file and index certificates of title
15
16
so that at all times it will be possible to trace a certificate of
16
17
title to the vehicle designated therein, identify the lien entry
17
18
form, and the names and addresses of secured parties, or their
18
19
assignees, so that all or any part of such information may be made
19
20
readily available to those who make legitimate inquiry of Service
20
21
Oklahoma as to the existence or nonexistence of security interest in
21
22
the vehicle.
22
23
D. 1. Any security interest in a vehicle properly perfected
23
24
prior to July 1, 1979, may be continued as to its effectiveness or
24
Req. No. 1004 Page 8
1
duration as provided by Sections 1-9-510 and 1-9-515 of Title 12A of
1
2
the Oklahoma Statutes, or may be terminated, assigned, or released
2
3
as provided by Sections 1-9-512, 1-9-513 and 1-9-514 of Title 12A of
3
4
the Oklahoma Statutes, as fully as if this section had not been
4
5
enacted, or, at the option of the secured party, may also be
5
6
perfected under this section, and, if so perfected, the time of
6
7
perfection under this section shall be the date the security
7
8
interest was originally perfected under the prior law.
8
9

Section 14:
2. Upon request of the secured party, the debtor or any other
9
10
holder of the certificate of title shall surrender the certificate
10
11
of title to the secured party and shall do such other acts as may be
11
12
required to perfect the security interest under this section.
12
13
E. If a manufactured home is permanently affixed to real
13
14
estate, an Oklahoma certificate of title may be surrendered to
14
15
Service Oklahoma or a licensed operator for cancellation. When the
15
16
document of title is surrendered, the owner shall provide the legal
16
17
description or the appropriate tract or parcel number of the real
17
18
estate and other information as may be required on a form provided
18
19
by Service Oklahoma. Service Oklahoma may not cancel a document of
19
20
title if a lien has been registered or recorded. Service Oklahoma
20
21
or the licensed operator shall notify the owner and any lienholder
21
22
that the title has been surrendered to Service Oklahoma and that
22
23
Service Oklahoma may not cancel the title until the lien is
23
24
released. Such notification shall include a description of the lien
24
Req. No. 1004 Page 9
1
and such notification to the owner shall be accompanied by the
1
2
return of title surrendered. Permanent attachment to real estate
2
3
does not affect the validity of a lien recorded or registered with
3
4
Service Oklahoma before the document of title is canceled pursuant
4
5
to this section. The rights of a prior lienholder pursuant to a
5
6
security agreement or the provisions of a credit transaction and the
6
7
rights of the state pursuant to a tax lien are preserved. Service
7
8
Oklahoma or the licensed operator shall forward the information to
8
9
the county assessor of the county where the real estate is located
9
10
and indicate whether the original document of title has been
10
11
canceled. A fee of Five Dollars ($5.00) shall accompany the
11
12
application for cancellation of title. When the fee is paid by a
12
13
person making an application directly with Service Oklahoma, the fee
13
14
shall be deposited in the Oklahoma Tax Commission Revolving Fund.
14
15
Beginning January 1, 2023, the fee shall be deposited in the Service
15
16
Oklahoma Revolving Fund. A fee paid to a licensed operator shall be
16
17
retained by the licensed operator. The owner of a manufactured home
17
18
upon which the document of title has been properly surrendered may
18
19
apply to Service Oklahoma for issuance of a new original certificate
19
20
of title upon submission of:
20
21

Section 15:
1. An attestation from the homeowner indicating ownership of
21
22
the manufactured home and the nonexistence of any security interest
22
23
or lien of record in the manufactured home; and
23
24
24
Req. No. 1004 Page 10
1

Section 16:
2. A title opinion by a licensed attorney, determining that the
1
2
owner of the manufactured home has marketable title to the real
2
3
property upon which the manufactured home is located and that no
3
4
documents filed of record in the county clerk’s office concerning
4
5
the real property contain a mortgage, recorded financial statement,
5
6
judgment, or lien of record. Persons or entities to whom the title
6
7
opinion is addressed may rely on the title opinion. A security
7
8
interest in a manufactured home perfected pursuant to this section
8
9
shall have priority over a conflicting interest of a mortgagee or
9
10
other lien encumbrancer, or the owner of the real property upon
10
11
which the manufactured home became affixed or otherwise permanently
11
12
attached. The holder of the security interest in the manufactured
12
13
home, upon default, may remove the manufactured home from such real
13
14
property. The holder of the security interest in the manufactured
14
15
home shall reimburse the owner of the real property who is not the
15
16
debtor and who has not otherwise agreed to access the real property
16
17
for the cost of repair of any physical injury to the real property,
17
18
but shall not be liable for any diminution in value to the real
18
19
property caused by the removal of the manufactured home, trespass,
19
20
or any other damages caused by the removal. The debtor shall notify
20
21
the holder of the security interest in the manufactured home of the
21
22
street address, if any, and the legal description of the real
22
23
property upon which the manufactured home is affixed or otherwise
23
24
permanently attached and shall sign such other documents, including
24
Req. No. 1004 Page 11
1
any appropriate mortgage, as may reasonably be requested by the
1
2
holder of such security interest.
2
3
F. In the case of motor vehicles or trailers, notwithstanding
3
4
any other provision of law, a transaction does not create a sale or
4
5
security interest merely because it provides that the rental price
5
6
is permitted or required to be adjusted under the agreement either
6
7
upward or downward by reference to the amount realized upon sale or
7
8
other disposition of the motor vehicle or trailer.
8
9
G. A security interest in vehicles registered by a federally
9
10
recognized Indian tribe shall be deemed valid under Oklahoma law if
10
11
validly perfected under the applicable tribal law and the lien is
11
12
noted on the face of the tribal certificate of title.
12
13

Section 17:
SECTION 2. This act shall become effective July 1, 2025.
13
14

Section 18:
SECTION 3. It being immediately necessary for the preservation
14
15
of the public peace, health or safety, an emergency is hereby
15
16
declared to exist, by reason whereof this act shall take effect and
16
17
be in full force from and after its passage and approval.

in a conspicuous place, on each of these instruments.
10
11
Of the ten-dollar fee, the licensed operator shall
11
12
retain Two Dollars ($2.00) for recording the security
12
13
interest lien.
13
14
b. It shall be unlawful for any person to solicit, accept
14
15
or receive any gratuity or compensation for acting as
15
16
a messenger and for acting as the agent or
16
17
representative of another person in applying for the
17
18
recording of a security interest or for the
18
19
registration of a motor vehicle and obtaining the

and approved the person to perform such acts; and
22
23
before acting as a messenger, any such person shall
23
24
furnish to Service Oklahoma a surety bond in such

9
5. Any person creating a security interest in a vehicle that
9
10
has been previously registered in the debtor’s name and on which all
10
11
taxes due the state have been paid shall surrender the certificate
11
12
of ownership to the secured party. The secured party shall have the
12
13
duty to record the security interest as provided in this section and
13
14
shall, at the same time, obtain a new certificate of title which
14
15
shall show the secured interest on the face of the certificate of
15
16
title.
16
17
6. The lien entry form with the date and assigned number
17
18
thereof clearly marked thereon shall be returned to the secured
18
19
party. If the lien entry form is received and authenticated, as
19
20
herein provided, by a licensed operator, the licensed operator shall
20
21
make a report thereof to Service Oklahoma upon the forms and in the
21

manner as may be prescribed by Service Oklahoma.
22
23

7. Service Oklahoma shall have the duty to record the lien upon
1
2
the face of the certificate of title issued at the time of
2
3
registering and paying all fees and taxes due on the vehicle.

4
8. When there is an active lien from a commercial lender in
4
5
place on a vehicle, licensed operators shall be prohibited from
5
6
transferring the certificate of title on that vehicle until the lien
6
7
is satisfied, except when the title is transferred:
7
8
a. to a person whose name is included on the loan for
8
9
which the lien is placed pursuant to an agreement by
9
10
the lender and any party to the title,
10
11
b. to a trust created by a person whose name is included
11
12
on the loan for which the lien is placed, or
12
13
c. from a person who has died, upon the submission of a
13
14
death certificate.
14
15
The provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to release
15
16
any lien or debt based solely upon a transfer of certificate of
16
17
title.
17
18
B. 1. A secured party shall, within seven (7) business days
18
19
after the satisfaction of the security interest, furnish directly or
19
20
by mail a release of a security interest to Service Oklahoma and
20
21
mail a copy thereof to the last-known address of the debtor. If the
21
22
security interest has been satisfied by payment from a licensed used
22
23
motor vehicle dealer to whom the motor vehicle has been transferred,
23
24
the secured party shall also, within seven (7) business days after
24
Req. No. 1004 Page 6

1
such satisfaction, mail an additional copy of the release to the
1
2
dealer. If the secured party fails to furnish the release as
2
3
required, the secured party shall be liable to the debtor for a
3
4
penalty of One Hundred Dollars ($100.00). Following the seven (7)
4
5
business days after satisfaction of the lien and upon receipt by the
5
6
lienholder of written communication demanding the release of the
6
7
lien, thereafter the penalty shall increase to One Hundred Dollars
7
8
($100.00) per day for each additional day beyond seven (7) business
8
9
days until accumulating to One Thousand Five Hundred Dollars
9
10
($1,500.00) or the value of the vehicle, whichever is less, and, in
10
11
addition, any loss caused to the debtor by such failure.
11
12
2. Upon release of a security interest the owner may obtain a
12
13
new certificate of title omitting reference to the security
13
14
interest, by submitting to Service Oklahoma or to a licensed
14
15
operator:
15
16
a. a release signed by the secured party, an application
16
17
for new certificate of title and the proper fees, or
17
18
b. by submitting to Service Oklahoma or the licensed
18
19
operator an affidavit, supported by such documentation
19
20
as Service Oklahoma may require, by the owner on a
20
21
form prescribed by Service Oklahoma stating that the
21
22
security interest has been satisfied and stating the
22
23
reasons why a release cannot be obtained, an
23
24
24
Req. No. 1004 Page 7

1
application for a new certificate of title and the
1
2
proper fees.
2
3
Upon receiving such affidavit that the security interest has been
3
4
satisfied, Service Oklahoma shall issue a new certificate of title
4
5
eliminating the satisfied security interest and the name and address
5
6
of the secured parties who have been paid and satisfied. Service
6
7
Oklahoma shall accept a release of a security interest in any form
7
8
that identifies the debtor, the secured party, and the vehicle, and
8
9
contains the signature of the secured party. Service Oklahoma shall
9
10
not require any particular form for the release of a security
10
11
interest.
11
12
The words “security interest” when used in the Oklahoma Vehicle
12
13
License and Registration Act do not include liens dependent upon
13
14
possession.
14
15
C. Service Oklahoma shall file and index certificates of title
15
16
so that at all times it will be possible to trace a certificate of
16
17
title to the vehicle designated therein, identify the lien entry
17
18
form, and the names and addresses of secured parties, or their
18
19
assignees, so that all or any part of such information may be made
19
20
readily available to those who make legitimate inquiry of Service
20
21
Oklahoma as to the existence or nonexistence of security interest in
21
22
the vehicle.
22
23
D. 1. Any security interest in a vehicle properly perfected
23
24
prior to July 1, 1979, may be continued as to its effectiveness or
24
Req. No. 1004 Page 8

1
duration as provided by Sections 1-9-510 and 1-9-515 of Title 12A of
1
2
the Oklahoma Statutes, or may be terminated, assigned, or released
2
3
as provided by Sections 1-9-512, 1-9-513 and 1-9-514 of Title 12A of
3
4
the Oklahoma Statutes, as fully as if this section had not been
4
5
enacted, or, at the option of the secured party, may also be
5
6
perfected under this section, and, if so perfected, the time of
6
7
perfection under this section shall be the date the security
7
8
interest was originally perfected under the prior law.
8
9
2. Upon request of the secured party, the debtor or any other
9
10
holder of the certificate of title shall surrender the certificate
10
11
of title to the secured party and shall do such other acts as may be
11
12
required to perfect the security interest under this section.
12
13
E. If a manufactured home is permanently affixed to real
13
14
estate, an Oklahoma certificate of title may be surrendered to
14
15
Service Oklahoma or a licensed operator for cancellation. When the
15
16
document of title is surrendered, the owner shall provide the legal
16
17
description or the appropriate tract or parcel number of the real
17
18
estate and other information as may be required on a form provided
18
19
by Service Oklahoma. Service Oklahoma may not cancel a document of
19
20
title if a lien has been registered or recorded. Service Oklahoma
20
21
or the licensed operator shall notify the owner and any lienholder
21
22
that the title has been surrendered to Service Oklahoma and that
22
23
Service Oklahoma may not cancel the title until the lien is
23
24
released. Such notification shall include a description of the lien
24
Req. No. 1004 Page 9

1
and such notification to the owner shall be accompanied by the
1
2
return of title surrendered. Permanent attachment to real estate
2
3
does not affect the validity of a lien recorded or registered with
3
4
Service Oklahoma before the document of title is canceled pursuant
4
5
to this section. The rights of a prior lienholder pursuant to a
5
6
security agreement or the provisions of a credit transaction and the
6
7
rights of the state pursuant to a tax lien are preserved. Service
7
8
Oklahoma or the licensed operator shall forward the information to
8
9
the county assessor of the county where the real estate is located
9
10
and indicate whether the original document of title has been
10
11
canceled. A fee of Five Dollars ($5.00) shall accompany the
11
12
application for cancellation of title. When the fee is paid by a
12
13
person making an application directly with Service Oklahoma, the fee
13
14
shall be deposited in the Oklahoma Tax Commission Revolving Fund.
14
15
Beginning January 1, 2023, the fee shall be deposited in the Service
15
16
Oklahoma Revolving Fund. A fee paid to a licensed operator shall be
16
17
retained by the licensed operator. The owner of a manufactured home
17
18
upon which the document of title has been properly surrendered may
18
19
apply to Service Oklahoma for issuance of a new original certificate
19
20
of title upon submission of:
20
21
1. An attestation from the homeowner indicating ownership of
21
22
the manufactured home and the nonexistence of any security interest
22
23
or lien of record in the manufactured home; and
23
24
24
Req. No. 1004 Page 10

1
2. A title opinion by a licensed attorney, determining that the
1
2
owner of the manufactured home has marketable title to the real
2
3
property upon which the manufactured home is located and that no
3
4
documents filed of record in the county clerk’s office concerning
4
5
the real property contain a mortgage, recorded financial statement,
5
6
judgment, or lien of record. Persons or entities to whom the title
6
7
opinion is addressed may rely on the title opinion. A security
7
8
interest in a manufactured home perfected pursuant to this section
8
9
shall have priority over a conflicting interest of a mortgagee or
9
10
other lien encumbrancer, or the owner of the real property upon
10
11
which the manufactured home became affixed or otherwise permanently
11
12
attached. The holder of the security interest in the manufactured
12
13
home, upon default, may remove the manufactured home from such real
13
14
property. The holder of the security interest in the manufactured
14
15
home shall reimburse the owner of the real property who is not the
15
16
debtor and who has not otherwise agreed to access the real property
16
17
for the cost of repair of any physical injury to the real property,
17
18
but shall not be liable for any diminution in value to the real
18
19
property caused by the removal of the manufactured home, trespass,
19
20
or any other damages caused by the removal. The debtor shall notify
20
21
the holder of the security interest in the manufactured home of the
21
22
street address, if any, and the legal description of the real
22
23
property upon which the manufactured home is affixed or otherwise
23
24
permanently attached and shall sign such other documents, including
24
Req. No. 1004 Page 11

1
any appropriate mortgage, as may reasonably be requested by the
1
2
holder of such security interest.
2
3
F. In the case of motor vehicles or trailers, notwithstanding
3
4
any other provision of law, a transaction does not create a sale or
4
5
security interest merely because it provides that the rental price
5
6
is permitted or required to be adjusted under the agreement either
6
7
upward or downward by reference to the amount realized upon sale or
7
8
other disposition of the motor vehicle or trailer.
8
9
G. A security interest in vehicles registered by a federally
9
10
recognized Indian tribe shall be deemed valid under Oklahoma law if
10
11
validly perfected under the applicable tribal law and the lien is
11
12
noted on the face of the tribal certificate of title.
12
13
SECTION 2. This act shall become effective July 1, 2025.
13
14
SECTION 3. It being immediately necessary for the preservation
14
15
of the public peace, health or safety, an emergency is hereby
15
16
declared to exist, by reason whereof this act shall take effect and
16
17
be in full force from and after its passage and approval.
