15 BE IT ENACTED BY THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF OKLAHOMA:
16 SECTION 1. AMENDATORY 12 O.S. 2021, Section 3226.1, is
17 amended to read as follows:
18 Section 3226.1. A. ABUSIVE DISCOVERY. In addition to the
19 protective orders that a court may issue pursuant to paragraph 1 of
20 subsection C of Section 3226 of Title 12 of the Oklahoma Statutes
21 this title, a protective order may be issued by the court
22 authorizing or denying discovery in the court in which the action is
23 pending. A protective order may also be authorized on matters
24 relating to a deposition. The order may be issued upon a motion by
Req. No. 12624 Page 1

1 a pa rty or the person from whom discovery is sought. The motion
2 shall be accompanied by a certification that the movant has in good
3 faith conferred or attempted to confer, either in person or by
4 telephone, with other affected parties in an effort to resolve the
5 dispute without court action. Upon receipt by the court of the
6 motion and certification, the court may enter the protective order
7 authorizing or denying the discovery upon a finding that justice
8 requires a party or person be protected from annoyance, harassment,
9 embarrassment, oppression or undue delay, burden, or expense.
10 B. DEPOSITION OF HIGH-RANKING OFFICER. 1. The court shall
11 find good cause to issue a protective order to prevent the
12 deposition of an officer of an organization if the party or person
13 seeking the protective order demonstrates that the officer sought to
14 be deposed:
15 a. is a current or former high-ranking officer of a
16 government entity or any other organization, public or
17 private, that is large and complex,
18 b. has unique and extensive scheduling demands or
19 responsibilities, and
20 c. lacks unique, personal knowledge of the issues being
21 litigated.
22 The party or person seeking the protective order shall file a
23 motion, accompanied by an affidavit or declaration of the officer,
24 establishing these requirements and identifying a person within the
Req. No. 12624 Page 2

1 orga nization who has knowledge of the subject matter involved in the
2 pending act.
3 2. If the party or person demonstrates the requirements in
4 paragraph 1 of subsection B of this section, the court shall issue a
5 protective order to prevent the deposition of that officer unless
6 the opposing party seeking the deposition demonstrates that:
7 a. it has exhausted all other reasonable means of
8 discovery,
9 b. such discovery is inadequate, and
10 c. the officer has unique, personal knowledge of
11 discoverable information.
12 3. To the extent that the party or person seeking the
13 protective order shows that the officer lacks unique, personal
14 knowledge of some, but not all, matters relevant to the subject
15 matter involved in the pending action, the court may limit the scope
16 of the deposition accordingly.
17 4. The court may vacate or modify the protective order if,
18 after additional discovery, the party seeking the deposition can
19 meet its burden under this subsection.
20 C. AWARD OF EXPENSES OF MOTION. If the motion is granted, the
21 court may, after opportunity for hearing, require the party or
22 person whose conduct necessitated the motion or the party or
23 attorney advising such conduct or both of them to pay to the moving
24 party the reasonable expenses incurred in obtaining the order,
Req. No. 12624 Page 3

1 incl uding attorney fees, unless the court finds that the opposition
2 to the motion was substantially justified or that other
3 circumstances make an award of expenses unjust.
4 If the motion is denied, the court may, after opportunity for
5 hearing, require the moving party or the attorney advising the
6 motion or both of them to pay to the party or deponent who opposed
7 the motion the reasonable expenses incurred in opposing the motion,
8 including attorney fees, unless the court finds that the making of
9 the motion was substantially justified or that other circumstances
10 make an award of expenses unjust.
11 If the motion is granted in part and denied in part, the court
12 may apportion the reasonable expenses incurred in relation to the
13 motion among the parties and persons in a just manner.
14 SECTION 2. This act shall become effective November 1, 2025.
