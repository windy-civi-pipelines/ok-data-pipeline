separate action and a separate order shall be entered
8
9
in the protective order action. Protective orders may
9
10
be dismissed in favor of restraining orders in the
10
11
divorce or separate maintenance action if the court
11
12
specifically finds, upon hearing, that such dismissal
12
13
is in the best interests of the parties and does not
13
14
compromise the safety of any petitioner.
14
15
If the defendant is a minor child, the petition shall be filed
15
16
with the court having jurisdiction over juvenile matters.

granted or not granted. The court may assess court costs, service
3
4
of process fees, attorney fees, other fees and filing fees against
4
5
the defendant at the hearing on the petition, if a protective order
5
6
is granted against the defendant; provided, the court shall have
6
7
authority to waive the costs and fees if the court finds that the
7
8
party does not have the ability to pay the costs and fees.

9

Section 11:
2. If the court makes specific findings that a petition for a
9
10

12

a protective order with the district court. The person seeking
9
10
relief shall provide a copy of the complaint that was filed with the
10
11
law enforcement agency at the full hearing if the complaint is not
11
12
available from the law enforcement agency. Failure to provide a
12
13
copy of the complaint filed with the law enforcement agency shall
13
14
constitute a frivolous filing and the court may assess attorney fees
14
15
and court costs against the plaintiff pursuant to paragraph 2 of
15
16
subsection C of this section. The filing of a petition for a
16
17
protective order shall not require jurisdiction or venue of the
17
18
criminal offense if either the plaintiff or defendant resides in the
18
19
county. If a petition has been filed in an action for divorce or
19
20
separate maintenance and either party to the action files a petition
20
21
for a protective order in the same county where the action for
21
22
divorce or separate maintenance is filed, the petition for the
22
23
protective order may be heard by the court hearing the divorce or
23
24
separate maintenance action if:

4
5
however, the petition for a protective order,
5
6
including, but not limited to, a petition in which
6
7
children are named as petitioners, shall remain a
7
8
separate action and a separate order shall be entered
8
9
in the protective order action. Protective orders may
9
10
be dismissed in favor of restraining orders in the
10
11
divorce or separate maintenance action if the court
11
12
specifically finds, upon hearing, that such dismissal
12
13
is in the best interests of the parties and does not
13
14
compromise the safety of any petitioner.
14
15
If the defendant is a minor child, the petition shall be filed
15
16

1
shall be charged the plaintiff or victim at any time for filing a
1
2
petition for a protective order whether a protective order is
2
3
granted or not granted. The court may assess court costs, service
3
4
of process fees, attorney fees, other fees and filing fees against
4
5
the defendant at the hearing on the petition, if a protective order
5
6
is granted against the defendant; provided, the court shall have
6
7
authority to waive the costs and fees if the court finds that the
7
8
party does not have the ability to pay the costs and fees.
8
9
2. If the court makes specific findings that a petition for a
9
10
protective order has been filed frivolously and no victim exists,
10
11
the court may assess attorney fees and court costs against the
11
12
plaintiff.
12
13
D. The person seeking relief shall prepare the petition or, at
13
14
the request of the plaintiff, the court clerk or the victim-witness
14
15
coordinator, victim support person, and court case manager shall
15
16

defendant. The court may order the defendant to make no contact
21
22
with the animal and forbid the defendant from taking, transferring,
22
23
encumbering, concealing, molesting, attacking, striking,
23
24
threatening, harming, or otherwise disposing of the animal.
