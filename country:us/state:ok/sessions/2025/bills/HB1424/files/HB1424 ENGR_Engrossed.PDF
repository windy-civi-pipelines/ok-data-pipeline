1 SECTION 2. NEW LAW A new section of law to be codified
2 in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 51-107a of Title 11, unless
3 there is created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:
4 A. Whenever an employer or bargaining agent claims that an
5 unfair labor practice has been committed by the other, it shall
6 notify the other in writing, within six (6) months of the commission
7 of the alleged practice. Within ten (10) days of such notification
8 each party shall each select and name one arbitrator and shall
9 immediately thereafter notify each other in writing of the name and
10 address of the person so selected. The two arbitrators so selected
11 and named shall, within five (5) days from and after the expiration
12 of the ten-day period hereinabove mentioned, agree upon and select a
13 third arbitrator. If, on the expiration of the period allowed
14 therefor, the arbitrators are unable to agree upon the selection of
15 a third arbitrator, the bargaining agent and the corporate
16 authorities shall request the Federal Mediation and Conciliation
17 Service to provide a list of five arbitrators.
18 B. Within ten (10) days after receipt of the list of
19 arbitrators from the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, the
20 two arbitrators already selected shall alternately strike the name
21 of one arbitrator from the list of five until one name remains, with
22 the party claiming an unfair labor practice has been committed
23 making the first strike from the list. The third arbitrator,
24 whether selected as a result of an agreement between the two

2 by the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, shall act as
3 chairperson of the Arbitration Board. The chairperson of the
4 Arbitration Board shall schedule a hearing, take evidence, and
5 render a decision based thereon. Decisions of the former Public
6 Employees Relations Board and of the National Labor Relations Board
7 may be considered persuasive on the issues presented.

12 corporate authorities shall be borne by the bargaining agent and the
13 corporate authorities respectively. The reasonable fees and
14 necessary expenses of the third arbitrator shall be borne equally by
15 the bargaining agent and corporate authorities. This provision
16 applies for interest arbitration, consideration of alleged unfair
17 labor practices, and for certification, decertification, election or
18 determination of the bargaining representative.
