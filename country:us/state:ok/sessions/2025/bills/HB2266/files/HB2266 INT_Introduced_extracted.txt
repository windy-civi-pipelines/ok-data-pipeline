9 zoning authority because of the absence of a local airport
10 authority. The Oklahoma Department of Aerospace and Aeronautics
11 shall determine whether such structures meet the requirements set
12 forth in this section. If the structures do not meet the
13 requirements as set forth in this section, the Oklahoma Department
14 of Aerospace and Aeronautics may request the owners of such
15 structure to make any necessary modifications to protect the health,
16 safety and welfare of the public, including, but not limited to,
17 altering, marking, mapping, or identifying such structure. The
18 Oklahoma Department of Aerospace and Aeronautics may assist the
19 owner of such structure in any manner deemed feasible by the
20 Oklahoma Department of Aerospace and Aeronautics.
21 SECTION 3. AMENDATORY 3 O.S. 2021, Section 421, as last

1 Section 421. A. The Oklahoma Department of Aerospace and
2 Aeronautics is hereby established as the clearinghouse for unmanned
3 aircraft systems (UAS) and advanced air mobility (AAM) in this state
4 and shall be designated as the agency of this state for the
5 promotion, enhancement and development of UAS and AAM as well as any
6 associated infrastructure necessary to ensure the safe integration
7 and use of this new technology within the state. The purpose of
8 this clearinghouse is to create a partnership between those entities
9 that currently operate UAS, those that desire to use this technology
10 in the future and other entities that can support the research and
11 development of UAS to ensure that this state can more effectively
12 respond to the needs of this critical sector of the aviation and
13 aerospace industry. In the operation of this clearinghouse, the
14 Department shall cooperate, assist and coordinate with the federal
15 government, agencies of this state, tribal entities, municipalities
16 and other persons in the development of unmanned aircraft systems
17 throughout the state to ensure the acceptance of this technology and
18 the successful integration of UAS into the National Airspace System.
19 Contingent upon the availability of funds, the Oklahoma Department
20 of Aerospace and Aeronautics may use established program processes
21 or may contract with other qualified entities to carry out the
22 duties and responsibilities of the Unmanned Aircraft Systems
23 Development Act of 2021.
24
Req. No. 10962 Page 7
1 B. The primary goal of the clearinghouse within the Department
2 is to establish a central point within state government to develop
3 and implement the strategy for how this state can become a leader in
4 the UAS and AAM industry. It will focus the collective resources,
5 knowledge, information and assets within state government to ensure
6 coordinated efforts amongst all parties. The clearinghouse will
7 have the authority to:
8 1. Conduct research on what other states and localities are
9 doing insofar as their UAS rules and regulations so that it can
10 provide recommendations to ensure this state is in the best position
11 within the industry;
12 2. Organize and coordinate the application for any UAS and AAM
13 test site, integration opportunity, pilot program or grant funding
14 on behalf of this state;
15 3. Maintain a registry of UAS being operated by state agencies,
16 except those UAS that are part of a university-affiliated research
17 program;
18 4. Maintain a registry of educational institutions that offer
19 training programs for users of UAS; and
20 5. Investigate the development of, and if necessary, create a
21 statewide system plan that will provide the framework for the
22 construction, development, siting, and potential partnerships
23 required for vertiports and other infrastructure needed to integrate
24
Req. No. 10962 Page 8
1 AAM and UAS into the existing air transportation system of the
2 state;
3 6. Develop a statewide network of UAS/AAM detection systems as
4 necessary to support the safe integration of these new technologies
5 into the state’s existing air transportation system; and
6 7. Create statewide or regional command/control and radar
7 systems or centers to support paragraph 6 of this subsection and the
8 Department's efforts to bring UAS/AAM testing and development to the
9 state. These systems or centers can be standalone or in partnership
10 with other federal, state, local, tribal, or nonprofit entities.
11 C. The Department is authorized to enter into partnerships with
12 any city or town of this state and, any county or political
13 subdivision or district in this state, or any public trust thereof,
14 or any federal government entity for the purpose of investing in and
15 operating infrastructure and any other items necessary to safely and
16 effectively integrate AAM and UAS into the existing air
17 transportation system of this state as well as the testing and
18 development of these aeronautical technologies.
19 SECTION 4. This act shall become effective November 1, 2025.
