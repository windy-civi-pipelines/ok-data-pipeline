10 Federal Communications Commission for structures exceeding federal
11 obstruction standards prior to May 20, 1975; nor shall it apply to
12 previously approved structures now existing, or any necessary
13 replacement or repairs to such existing structures, so long as the
14 height and location is unchanged.
15 D. In determining whether to issue or deny a permit, the local
16 airport zoning authority shall consider:
17 1. The nature of the terrain and height of existing structures;
18 2. Public and private interests and investments;
19 3. The character of flying operations and planned developments
20 of airports, vertiports, and heliports;
21 4. Federal airways as designated by the Federal Aviation

3 height at the affected airport;
4 6. Technological advances;
5 7. The safety of persons on the ground and in the air; and
6 8. Land use density.

11 1, 1996, in which no permit was secured from the local airport
12 zoning authority because of the absence of a local airport
13 authority. The Oklahoma Department of Aerospace and Aeronautics
14 shall determine whether such structures meet the requirements set
15 forth in this section. If the structures do not meet the
16 requirements as set forth in this section, the Oklahoma Department
17 of Aerospace and Aeronautics may request the owners of such
18 structure to make any necessary modifications to protect the health,
19 safety and welfare of the public, including, but not limited to,
20 altering, marking, mapping, or identifying such structure. The
21 Oklahoma Department of Aerospace and Aeronautics may assist the

15 test site, integration opportunity, pilot program or grant funding
16 on behalf of this state;
17 3. Maintain a registry of UAS being operated by state agencies,
18 except those UAS that are part of a university-affiliated research
19 program;
20 4. Maintain a registry of educational institutions that offer
21 training programs for users of UAS; and
22 5. Investigate the development of, and if necessary, create a
23 statewide system plan that will provide the framework for the
24 construction, development, siting, and potential partnerships

1 requ ired for vertiports and other infrastructure needed to integrate
2 AAM and UAS into the existing air transportation system of the
3 state;
4 6. Develop a statewide network of UAS/AAM detection systems as
5 necessary to support the safe integration of these new technologies
6 into the state’s existing air transportation system; and
7 7. Create statewide or regional command/control and radar
8 systems or centers to support paragraph 6 of this subsection and the
9 Department's efforts to bring UAS/AAM testing and development to the
10 state. These systems or centers can be standalone or in partnership
11 with other federal, state, local, tribal, or nonprofit entities.
12 C. The Department is authorized to enter into partnerships with
13 any city or town of this state and, any county or political
14 subdivision or district in this state, or any public trust thereof,
15 or any federal government entity for the purpose of investing in and
16 operating infrastructure and any other items necessary to safely and
17 effectively integrate AAM and UAS into the existing air
18 transportation system of this state as well as the testing and
