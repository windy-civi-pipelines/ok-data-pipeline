13 federal obstruction standards as contained in 14 CFR, Part 77.
14 Permits from the local airport zoning authority will be required
15 only within an airport hazard area where federal standards are
16 exceeded and if the proposed construction is within:
17 1. A 10-nautical mile radius of the geographical center of a
18 publicly owned or operated airport, a military airport, or an
19 airport open for public use which has a published instrument
20 approach procedure;

20 replacement or repairs to such existing structures, so long as the
21 height and location is unchanged.
22 D. In determining whether to issue or deny a permit, the local
23 airport zoning authority shall consider:
24 1. The nature of the terrain and height of existing structures;
SENATE FLOOR VERSION - HB2266 SFLR Page 4
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)

1 2. Public and private interests and investments;
2 3. The character of flying operations and planned developments

17 1, 1996, in which no permit was secured from the local airport
18 zoning authority because of the absence of a local airport
19 authority. The Oklahoma Department of Aerospace and Aeronautics
20 shall determine whether such structures meet the requirements set
21 forth in this section. If the structures do not meet the
22 requirements as set forth in this section, the Oklahoma Department

9 Section 421. A. The Oklahoma Department of Aerospace and
10 Aeronautics is hereby established as the clearinghouse for unmanned
11 aircraft systems (UAS) and advanced air mobility (AAM) in this state
12 and shall be designated as the agency of this state for the
13 promotion, enhancement and development of UAS and AAM as well as any
14 associated infrastructure necessary to ensure the safe integration
15 and use of this new technology within the state. The purpose of
16 this clearinghouse is to create a partnership between those entities
17 that currently operate UAS, those that desire to use this technology
18 in the future and other entities that can support the research and
19 development of UAS to ensure that this state can more effectively
20 respond to the needs of this critical sector of the aviation and
21 aerospace industry. In the operation of this clearinghouse, the
22 Department shall cooperate, assist and coordinate with the federal
23 government, agencies of this state, tribal entities, municipalities
24 and other persons in the development of unmanned aircraft systems
SENATE FLOOR VERSION - HB2266 SFLR Page 6
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)

1 thro ughout the state to ensure the acceptance of this technology and
2 the successful integration of UAS into the National Airspace System.
3 Contingent upon the availability of funds, the Oklahoma Department
4 of Aerospace and Aeronautics may use established program processes
5 or may contract with other qualified entities to carry out the
6 duties and responsibilities of the Unmanned Aircraft Systems
7 Development Act of 2021.
8 B. The primary goal of the clearinghouse within the Department
9 is to establish a central point within state government to develop
10 and implement the strategy for how this state can become a leader in
11 the UAS and AAM industry. It will focus the collective resources,
12 knowledge, information and assets within state government to ensure
13 coordinated efforts amongst all parties. The clearinghouse will
14 have the authority to:
15 1. Conduct research on what other states and localities are
16 doing insofar as their UAS rules and regulations so that it can
17 provide recommendations to ensure this state is in the best position
18 within the industry;
19 2. Organize and coordinate the application for any UAS and AAM
20 test site, integration opportunity, pilot program or grant funding
21 on behalf of this state;
22 3. Maintain a registry of UAS being operated by state agencies,
23 except those UAS that are part of a university-affiliated research
24 program;
SENATE FLOOR VERSION - HB2266 SFLR Page 7
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)

1 4. Maintain a registry of educational institutions that offer
2 training programs for users of UAS; and
3 5. Investigate the development of, and if necessary, create a
4 statewide system plan that will provide the framework for the
5 construction, development, siting, and potential partnerships
6 required for vertiports and other infrastructure needed to integrate
7 AAM and UAS into the existing air transportation system of the
8 state;
9 6. Develop a statewide network of UAS/AAM detection systems as
10 necessary to support the safe integration of these new technologies
11 into the state’s existing air transportation system; and
12 7. Create statewide or regional command/control and radar
13 systems or centers to support paragraph 6 of this subsection and the
14 Department's efforts to bring UAS/AAM testing and development to the
15 state. These systems or centers can be standalone or in partnership
16 with other federal, state, local, tribal, or nonprofit entities.
17 C. The Department is authorized to enter into partnerships with
18 any city or town of this state and, any county or political
19 subdivision or district in this state, or any public trust thereof,
20 or any federal government entity for the purpose of investing in and
21 operating infrastructure and any other items necessary to safely and
22 effectively integrate AAM and UAS into the existing air
23 transportation system of this state as well as the testing and
24 development of these aeronautical technologies.
