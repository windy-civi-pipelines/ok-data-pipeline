16 SECTION 1. NEW LAW A new section of law to be codified

19 A. There is hereby created in the State Treasury a revolving
20 fund for the Oklahoma Tax Commission to be designated the “Centrally
21 Assessed Ad Valorem Volatility Reimbursement Fund”. The fund shall
22 be a continuing fund, not subject to fiscal year limitations, and

24 are designated for deposit in the fund. Monies appropriated to this
Req. No. 1806 Page 1

1 fund shall be expended to reimburse counties for school district and
2 county purposes for loss of revenue due to decreased valuation and
3 assessment of centrally assessed property.
4 B. To qualify for reimbursement pursuant to subsection A of
5 this section, the county shall have at least a fifty-percent
6 reduction in net assessed value from centrally assessed properties
7 from the previous year with a school district that would realize at
8 least a ten-percent reduction in ad valorem tax revenues from the
9 previous year.
10 C. Counties qualifying for reimbursement provided by this
11 section shall receive an amount equal to twenty-five percent (25%)
12 of the reduction of collections for the first two (2) years after
13 the reduction in valuation; provided, that the reimbursement in the
14 second year shall be twenty-five percent (25%) of the reduction of
15 ad valorem collections in the second year compared to the immediate
16 year before the reduction in valuation that triggered the
17 qualification for reimbursement.
18 D. Reimbursement funds shall first be used to supplement the
19 reduction in funds to school districts due to a decrease in
20 valuation of centrally assessed properties. Any funds remaining
21 after supplementing the reduction in funds for school districts
22 shall be used to supplement the reduction in funds for counties.
23 E. The county commissioners of each county seeking
24 reimbursement for lost revenue from the Centrally Assessed Ad
Req. No. 1806 Page 2

1 Valo rem Volatility Reimbursement Fund shall make claims for
2 reimbursement on forms prescribed by the Tax Commission no later
3 than December 1 following the reduction in valuation that triggered
4 the qualification for reimbursement.
5 F. Total claims approved for reimbursement shall not exceed the
6 balance of the fund. If total claims exceed the balance of the
7 fund, each claim shall be reduced by a percentage which establishes
8 the proportionate share of total claims for the tax year so that the
9 total claims authorized by this section do not exceed the balance of
10 the fund.
11 SECTION 2. There is hereby appropriated to the Oklahoma Tax
12 Commission for deposit in the Centrally Assessed Ad Valorem
13 Volatility Reimbursement Fund, from any monies not otherwise
14 appropriated from the General Revenue Fund of the State Treasury for
15 the fiscal year ending June 30, 2024, the sum of Two Million Dollars
16 ($2,000,000.00).
17 SECTION 3. This act shall become effective July 1, 2025.
18 SECTION 4. It being immediately necessary for the preservation
19 of the public peace, health or safety, an emergency is hereby
20 declared to exist, by reason whereof this act shall take effect and
21 be in full force from and after its passage and approval.
