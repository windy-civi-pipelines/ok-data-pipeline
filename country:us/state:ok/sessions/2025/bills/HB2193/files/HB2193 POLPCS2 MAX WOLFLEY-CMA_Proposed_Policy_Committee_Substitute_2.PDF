14 (1) for members who have accrued at least eight (8)
15 years of credited service with the sending
16 system, determine the present value of the

18 years of service sought to be transferred,
19 discounted according to the member's age at the
20 time of transfer and computed as of the earliest
21 age at which the member would be able to retire.

8 purposes of determining the transfer fee to be
9 paid by the employee under subparagraph c of this
10 paragraph so long as it is greater than the
11 product of the calculation in division (2) of
12 this subparagraph, and

5 b. Within thirty (30) days notification of an intent to
6 transfer is received by the receiving system, the
7 receiving system shall determine, according to the
8 system's own rules and regulations, the present value
9 of the member's incremental projected benefits
10 discounted according to the member's age at the time
11 of the transfer. Incremental projected benefits shall
12 be the difference between the projected benefit said
13 member would receive without transferring the service
14 credit and the projected benefit after transfer of
15 service credit computed as of the earliest age at
16 which the member would be able to retire. Said
17 computation shall assume an unreduced benefit and be
18 computed using interest, salary projections and
19 mortality assumptions consistent with the actuarial
20 assumptions adopted by the Board of Trustees for
21 purposes of preparing the annual actuarial evaluation.
22 c. The sending system shall, within sixty (60) days from

5 receiving system, as established in subparagraph b of
6 this paragraph, the sending system shall send the
7 receiving system an amount equal to the actuarial
8 value of the incremental projected benefit in the
9 receiving system.
10 d. In order to receive the credit provided for in
11 paragraph 1 of this subsection, if the cost of the
12 actuarial value of the incremental benefit to the
13 receiving system is greater than the cost as
14 calculated under subparagraph a of this paragraph for
15 the same years of service to the sending system as
16 established in subparagraphs a and b of this
17 paragraph, the employee shall elect to:
18 (1) pay any difference to receive full credit for the
19 years sought to be transferred, or
20 (2) receive prorated service credit for only the

5 shall be used both in determining the member's retirement benefit
6 and in determining the years of service for retirement and/or
7 vesting purposes. Years of service rendered as a member of the
