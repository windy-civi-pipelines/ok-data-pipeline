Section 420.5. A. The Board is authorized to establish a fee,
to be paid to the Administrator, upon the sale, purchase, rental
and/or use in this state of liquefied petroleum gas refillable
cylinders and all other liquefied petroleum gas containers. The fee
shall be used to offset the cost of LP-Gas Administration
inspections, including, but not limited to, inspections of whether
cylinders were constructed in accordance with United States
Department of Transportation specifications, and inspections of
cylinder exchange stations, more generally.
B. Each manufacturer of LP-Gas containers in Oklahoma, each
vendor of containers manufactured outside of the state, and each
person, firm or corporation placing any LPG container or cylinder in
use in this state, including, but not limited to, LPG dealers or
distributors who ship containers from any point outside of Oklahoma
to a point within Oklahoma, shall pay the applicable fee. For

outside of the state. In no event shall the fees herein levied be
paid or become payable on any container or cylinder sold, rented,
purchased or placed in use in this state prior to the effective date
ENR. H. B. NO. 1157 Page 12

of this act, or more than once on any container or cylinder, or upon
any container or cylinder resold, rerented, repurchased or reused in
this state. The Administrator is authorized to refund or credit
fees upon containers sold outside of the state upon which the fees
have previously been paid, or any fees which have erroneously been
paid, upon written application supported by affidavit setting forth
the basis for such refund. The Administrator is authorized to adopt
a system of identification of containers on which the fees herein
levied have been paid. The Board shall promulgate administrative
rules establishing cylinder and container fees and otherwise
implementing this section.
C. For containers that are placed in cylinder exchange cabinets
for sale or rental, the cylinder and container fee shall be a flat
fee that is levied on an annual basis for each separate Class VII
permit location. For the purposes of this act, a cylinder exchange
cabinet is a lockable and ventilated metal locker or rack for the
storage of LPG cylinders that prevents tampering with valves and
pilferage into the cylinders. The Administrator is authorized to
adopt a system that identifies the cylinders and containers on which
the fees herein levied have been paid. Such a system may include
identification tags that are affixed to individual cylinders and
tanks or cylinder exchange cabinets.
D. No person, firm or corporation shall use or install in this
state any container or cylinder upon which the applicable fee levied
above applies and has not been paid. In case of failure to pay any
invoice issued by the Board or Administration within the specified
time, there shall be assessed a penalty of twenty-five percent
(25%), which shall be added to the applicable fee thirty-five (35)
calendar days of the issuance thereof, there shall be assessed a
penalty of twenty-five percent (25%), which shall be added to the
applicable fee. The twenty-five-percent penalty shall be in
addition to any other penalty provided by law, including, but not
limited to, the administrative penalty established pursuant to
Section 420.6 of this title.

containers, apparatus, or appliances installed in this state, and
any LPG bulk-delivery trucks or trailers used in this state,
whenever in the discretion of the Administrator, any deputy
ENR. H. B. NO. 1157 Page 13

administrator, or any safety code enforcement officer such
inspection is necessary to effectuate the purposes of this act. The
Administrator and, any deputy administrator, or safety code
enforcement officer are hereby severally empowered and authorized to
enter upon any premises where any such installation is being or has
been made to conduct such inspection.
B. The Administrator, under the direction of the Board, shall
require proving of metering system to determine the accuracy to be
within the manufacturer's tolerance not to exceed plus or minus one
percent (1%) at any time. The LPG liquid meter system shall be
designed and constructed to provide for applying lead-and-wire seals
in such a manner that no modifications or adjustments which would
affect the accuracy of deliveries, can be made without mutilating
the seal or seals.
C. Every person to whom the Board or the Administrator issues a
registration permit as herein provided shall have immediate
possession of the permit at all times when engaged in that phase of
the LPG business for which the same was issued and shall display the
same upon demand of the Administrator, the chief deputy
administrator, or any deputy administrator or safety code
enforcement officer.

safety code enforcement officers shall be Council on Law Enforcement
Education and Training (CLEET) certified before the Administrator

in making arrests for violations of this act or the safety rules
promulgated thereunder, or in serving any process, notice, or order
connected with the enforcement of this act issued by the
Administrator.
E. The Administrator, the chief deputy administrator and any
deputy administrator or safety code enforcement officer are hereby
empowered and authorized to sign complaints against and to cause the
arrest of any person charged with a violation or violations of this
ENR. H. B. NO. 1157 Page 14

act or the safety rules promulgated thereunder. In the event the
district attorney fails or refuses to draw or endorse any complaint
submitted to the district attorney and the complainant, whether it
be the Administrator, the chief deputy administrator or any deputy
administrator or safety code enforcement officer, desires to secure
prosecution of the complaint, then and in that event any court of
competent jurisdiction shall be authorized to issue a warrant for
the arrest of the person charged in the complaint and the
complainant shall not be required to file with the court the bond
provided to be filed with and approved by the court in Sections 231
through 233 of Title 22 of the Oklahoma Statutes.
F. The Administrator and any deputy or safety code enforcement
officer are hereby severally empowered and authorized to condemn any
liquefied petroleum gas system, container, apparatus or appliance in
this state not manufactured, fabricated, assembled or installed in
accordance with the safety rules adopted or promulgated under this
act, and shall have the authority to forbid the use of any such
