percent (50%) of the apportionment factor. The apportionment
10
11
factors shall be computed as follows:
11
12
a. The property factor is a fraction, the numerator of
12
13
which is the average value of the taxpayer’s real and
13
14
tangible personal property owned or rented and used in
14
15
this state during the tax period and the denominator
15
16
of which is the average value of all the taxpayer’s
16
17
real and tangible personal property everywhere owned
17
18
or rented and used during the tax period.
18
19
(1) Property, the income from which is separately
19
20

7
traveled,
7
8
(2) Property owned by the taxpayer is valued at its
8
9
original cost. Property rented by the taxpayer
9
10
is valued at eight times the net annual rental
10
11
rate. Net annual rental rate is the annual
11
12
rental rate paid by the taxpayer, less any annual
12
13
rental rate received by the taxpayer from
13
14
subrentals,
14
15
(3) The average value of property shall be determined
15
16
by averaging the values at the beginning and
16
17
ending of the tax period but the Oklahoma Tax
17
18
Commission may require the averaging of monthly
18
19
values during the tax period if reasonably
19
20
required to reflect properly the average value of
20
21
the taxpayer’s property;
21
22
b. The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of
22
23
which is the total compensation for services rendered
23
24
in the state during the tax period, and the
24
Req. No. 1557 Page 12

7
8
numerator of the fraction shall include a portion
8
9

10
11
railroad employees, airline pilots, or bus
11
12
drivers, in this state only a part of the time,
12
13
in the proportion that mileage traveled in
13
14
Oklahoma this state bears to total mileage
14
15
traveled by such employees,
15
16
(2) In any case the numerator of the fraction shall
16
17
include a portion of such expenditures in
17
18
connection with itinerant employees, such as
18
19
traveling salespersons, in this state only a part
19
20
of the time, in the proportion that time spent in
20
21
Oklahoma this state bears to total time spent in
21
22
furtherance of the enterprise by such employees;
22
23
c. The sales factor is a fraction, the numerator of which
23
24
is the total sales or gross revenue of the taxpayer in
24
Req. No. 1557 Page 13
1
this state during the tax period, and the denominator
1
2
of which is the total sales or gross revenue of the
2
3
taxpayer everywhere during the tax period. “Sales”,
3
4
as used in this subsection, does not include sales or
4
5
gross revenue which are separately allocated in
5
6
paragraph 4 of this subsection.
6
7
(1) Sales of tangible personal property have a situs

(4) In the case of an oil, gasoline or gas pipeline
7
8
enterprise, the numerator of the fraction shall

11
revenue allocated to Oklahoma this state based
11
12
upon miles moved, at the option of the taxpayer,
12
13
and the denominator of which shall be the total

In any case where the apportionment of the three factors
17
18
prescribed in this paragraph attributes to Oklahoma this state a
18
19
portion of net income of the enterprise out of all appropriate
19
20
proportion to the property owned and/or business transacted within
20
21
this state, because of the fact that one or more of the factors so
21
22
prescribed are not employed to any appreciable extent in furtherance
22
23
of the enterprise; or because one or more factors not so prescribed
23
24
are employed to a considerable extent in furtherance of the
24
Req. No. 1557 Page 16
1
enterprise; or because of other reasons, the Tax Commission is
1
2
empowered to permit, after a showing by taxpayer that an excessive
2

portion of net income has been attributed to Oklahoma this state, or
3

require, when in its judgment an insufficient portion of net income
4
5
has been attributed to Oklahoma this state, the elimination,
5
6
substitution, or use of additional factors, or reduction or increase
6
7
in the weight of such prescribed factors. Provided, however, that
7
8
any such variance from such prescribed factors which has the effect
8
9
of increasing the portion of net income attributable to Oklahoma
9
10
this state must not be inherently arbitrary, and application of the
10
11
recomputed final apportionment to the net income of the enterprise
11
12
must attribute to Oklahoma this state only a reasonable portion
12
13
thereof.

7
8
apportioned with property and payroll, each comprising twenty-five
8
9
percent (25%) of the apportionment factor and sales comprising fifty
9
10
percent (50%) of the apportionment factor. The apportionment
10
11
factors shall be computed as follows:
11
12
a. The property factor is a fraction, the numerator of
12
13
which is the average value of the taxpayer’s real and
13
14
tangible personal property owned or rented and used in
14
15
this state during the tax period and the denominator
15
16
of which is the average value of all the taxpayer’s
16
17
real and tangible personal property everywhere owned
17
18
or rented and used during the tax period.
18
19

traveled,
7
8
(2) Property owned by the taxpayer is valued at its
8
9
original cost. Property rented by the taxpayer
9
10
is valued at eight times the net annual rental
10
11
rate. Net annual rental rate is the annual
11
12
rental rate paid by the taxpayer, less any annual
12
13
rental rate received by the taxpayer from
13
14
subrentals,
14
15
(3) The average value of property shall be determined
15
16
by averaging the values at the beginning and
16
17
ending of the tax period but the Oklahoma Tax
17
18
Commission may require the averaging of monthly
18
19
values during the tax period if reasonably
19
20
required to reflect properly the average value of
20
21
the taxpayer’s property;
21
22
b. The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of
22
23
which is the total compensation for services rendered
23
24
in the state during the tax period, and the
24
Req. No. 1557 Page 12

those paid-for services to the extent related to the
4
5
unitary business but does not include officers’
5
6
salaries, wages and other compensation.
6
7
(1) In the case of a transportation enterprise, the
7
8
numerator of the fraction shall include a portion
8
9

9
10
operating equipment over a fixed route, such as
10
11
railroad employees, airline pilots, or bus
11
12
drivers, in this state only a part of the time,
12
13
in the proportion that mileage traveled in
13
14
Oklahoma this state bears to total mileage
14
15
traveled by such employees,
15
16
(2) In any case the numerator of the fraction shall
16
17
include a portion of such expenditures in
17
18
connection with itinerant employees, such as
18
19
traveling salespersons, in this state only a part
19
20
of the time, in the proportion that time spent in
20
21
Oklahoma this state bears to total time spent in
21
22
furtherance of the enterprise by such employees;
22
23
c. The sales factor is a fraction, the numerator of which
23
24
is the total sales or gross revenue of the taxpayer in
24
Req. No. 1557 Page 13

1
this state during the tax period, and the denominator
1
2
of which is the total sales or gross revenue of the
2
3
taxpayer everywhere during the tax period. “Sales”,
3
4
as used in this subsection, does not include sales or
4
5
gross revenue which are separately allocated in
5
6
paragraph 4 of this subsection.
6
7
(1) Sales of tangible personal property have a situs
7
8
in this state if the property is delivered or
8
9
shipped to a purchaser other than the United
9
10
States government, within this state regardless
10
11
of the FOB Freight on Board (FOB) point or other
11
12
conditions of the sale; or the property is
12
13
shipped from an office, store, warehouse, factory
13
14
or other place of storage in this state and (a)

the purchaser is the United States government or
15
16
(b) the taxpayer is not doing business in the
16
17
state of the destination of the shipment.
17
18
(2) In the case of a railroad or interurban railway
18
19
enterprise, the numerator of the fraction shall
19
20
not be less than the allocation of revenues to
20
21
this state as shown in its annual report to the
21
22
Corporation Commission.
22

car or other railroad equipment enterprise, the
1
2
numerator of the fraction shall include a portion
2
3
of revenue from interstate transportation in the
3
4
proportion that interstate mileage traveled in
4
5
Oklahoma this state bears to total interstate
5
6
mileage traveled.
6
7
(4) In the case of an oil, gasoline or gas pipeline
7
8
enterprise, the numerator of the fraction shall
8
9
be either the total of traffic units of the
9
10
enterprise within Oklahoma this state or the
10
11
revenue allocated to Oklahoma this state based
11
12
upon miles moved, at the option of the taxpayer,
12
13
and the denominator of which shall be the total
13
14
of traffic units of the enterprise or the revenue
14
15
of the enterprise everywhere as appropriate to
15
16
the numerator. A “traffic unit” is hereby
16
17
defined as the transportation for a distance of
17
18
one (1) mile of one (1) barrel of oil, one (1)
18
19
gallon of gasoline or one thousand (1,000) cubic
19
20
feet of natural or casinghead gas, as the case
20
21
may be.

(5) In the case of a telephone or telegraph or other
22
23
communication enterprise, the numerator of the
23
24
fraction shall include that portion of the
24
Req. No. 1557 Page 15

1
interstate revenue as is allocated pursuant to
1
2
the accounting procedures prescribed by the

3
Federal Communications Commission; provided that
3
4
in respect to each corporation or business entity
4
5
required by the Federal Communications Commission
5
6
to keep its books and records in accordance with
6
7
a uniform system of accounts prescribed by such
7
8
Commission, the intrastate net income shall be
8
9
determined separately in the manner provided by
9
10
such uniform system of accounts and only the
10
11
interstate income shall be subject to allocation
11
12
pursuant to the provisions of this subsection.
12
13
Provided further, that the gross revenue factors
13
14
shall be those as are determined pursuant to the
14
15
accounting procedures prescribed by the Federal
15
16
Communications Commission.
16
17
In any case where the apportionment of the three factors
17
18
prescribed in this paragraph attributes to Oklahoma this state a
18
19
portion of net income of the enterprise out of all appropriate
19
20
proportion to the property owned and/or business transacted within
20
21
this state, because of the fact that one or more of the factors so
21
22
prescribed are not employed to any appreciable extent in furtherance
22
23
of the enterprise; or because one or more factors not so prescribed
23
24
are employed to a considerable extent in furtherance of the
24
Req. No. 1557 Page 16

1
enterprise; or because of other reasons, the Tax Commission is
1
2
empowered to permit, after a showing by taxpayer that an excessive
2
3
portion of net income has been attributed to Oklahoma this state, or
3
4
require, when in its judgment an insufficient portion of net income
4
5
has been attributed to Oklahoma this state, the elimination,
5
6
substitution, or use of additional factors, or reduction or increase
6
7
in the weight of such prescribed factors. Provided, however, that
7
8
any such variance from such prescribed factors which has the effect
8
9
of increasing the portion of net income attributable to Oklahoma
9
10
this state must not be inherently arbitrary, and application of the
10
11
recomputed final apportionment to the net income of the enterprise
11
12
must attribute to Oklahoma this state only a reasonable portion
12
13
thereof.
13

shall be taken in the taxable year when the investment is made. In
4
5
the event the total reduction in tax liability authorized by this
5
6
paragraph exceeds One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) in any
6
7
calendar year, the Tax Commission shall permit any excess over One
7
8
Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) and shall factor such excess into
8
9
the percentage for subsequent years. Any amount of the exemption
9
10
permitted to be excluded pursuant to the provisions of this
10
11
paragraph but not used in any year may be carried forward as an
11
12
