5 3. The amount of any federal net operating loss deduction shall
6 be adjusted as follows:
7 a. For carryovers and carrybacks to taxable years
8 beginning before January 1, 1981, the amount of any
9 net operating loss deduction allowed to a taxpayer for
10 federal income tax purposes shall be reduced to an
11 amount which is the same portion thereof as the loss
12 from sources within this state, as determined pursuant
13 to this section and Section 2362 of this title, for
14 the taxable year in which such loss is sustained is of
15 the total loss for such year;
16 b. For carryovers and carrybacks to taxable years
17 beginning after December 31, 1980, the amount of any
18 net operating loss deduction allowed for the taxable
19 year shall be an amount equal to the aggregate of the

15 business or commercial situs apart from the
16 domicile of the taxpayer such income shall be
17 allocated in accordance with such business or
18 commercial situs; interest income from
19 investments held to generate working capital for
20 a unitary business enterprise shall be included
21 in apportionable income; a resident trust or
22 resident estate shall be treated as having a
23 separate commercial or business situs insofar as
24 undistributed income is concerned, but shall not
ENGR. S. B. NO. 299 Page 4

1 be treated as having a separate commercial or
2 business situs insofar as distributed income is
3 concerned,
4 (2) for taxable years beginning after December 31,
5 2003, capital or ordinary gains or losses from
6 the sale of an ownership interest in a publicly
7 traded partnership, as defined by Section 7704(b)
8 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,
9 shall be allocated to this state in the ratio of
10 the original cost of such partnership’s tangible
11 property in this state to the original cost of
12 such partnership’s tangible property everywhere,
13 as determined at the time of the sale; if more
14 than fifty percent (50%) of the value of the
15 partnership’s assets consists of intangible
16 assets, capital or ordinary gains or losses from

16 enterprise the business of which in Oklahoma this
17 state consists solely of marketing its products by:

3 (3) sales of the product stored in public warehouses
4 within the state where the shipment to such
5 warehouses is not covered by “in transit”
6 tariffs, as prescribed and allowed by the
7 Interstate Commerce Commission, to a purchaser
8 within or without the state,
9 the Oklahoma net income shall, at the option of the
10 taxpayer, be that portion of the total net income of
11 the taxpayer for federal income tax purposes derived
12 from the manufacture and/or processing and sales
13 everywhere as determined by the ratio of the sales
14 defined in this section made to the purchaser within
15 the state to the total sales everywhere. The term
16 “public warehouse” as used in this subparagraph means
17 a licensed public warehouse, the principal business of
18 which is warehousing merchandise for the public;
19 e. In the case of insurance companies, Oklahoma taxable

24
ENGR. S. B. NO. 299 Page 7

1 (1) except as otherwise provided by division (2) of
2 this subparagraph, taxable income of an insurance
3 company for a taxable year shall be apportioned
4 to this state by multiplying such income by a
5 fraction, the numerator of which is the direct
6 premiums written for insurance on property or
7 risks in this state, and the denominator of which
8 is the direct premiums written for insurance on
9 property or risks everywhere. For purposes of
10 this subsection, the term “direct premiums
11 written” means the total amount of direct
12 premiums written, assessments and annuity
13 considerations as reported for the taxable year
14 on the annual statement filed by the company with
15 the Insurance Commissioner in the form approved
16 by the National Association of Insurance
17 Commissioners, or such other form as may be
18 prescribed in lieu thereof,
19 (2) if the principal source of premiums written by an
20 insurance company consists of premiums for
21 reinsurance accepted by it, the taxable income of
22 such company shall be apportioned to this state
23 by multiplying such income by a fraction, the
24 numerator of which is the sum of (a) direct
ENGR. S. B. NO. 299 Page 8

1 premiums written for insurance on property or
2 risks in this state, plus (b) premiums written
3 for reinsurance accepted in respect of property
4 or risks in this state, and the denominator of
5 which is the sum of (c) direct premiums written
6 for insurance on property or risks everywhere,
7 plus (d) premiums written for reinsurance
8 accepted in respect of property or risks
9 everywhere. For purposes of this paragraph,
10 premiums written for reinsurance accepted in
11 respect of property or risks in this state,
12 whether or not otherwise determinable, may at the
13 election of the company be determined on the
14 basis of the proportion which premiums written
15 for insurance accepted from companies
16 commercially domiciled in Oklahoma this state
17 bears to premiums written for reinsurance
18 accepted from all sources, or alternatively in
19 the proportion which the sum of the direct
20 premiums written for insurance on property or
21 risks in this state by each ceding company from
22 which reinsurance is accepted bears to the sum of
23 the total direct premiums written by each such
24 ceding company for the taxable year.
ENGR. S. B. NO. 299 Page 9

1 5. The net income or loss remaining after the separate
2 allocation in paragraph 4 of this subsection, being that which is
3 derived from a unitary business enterprise, shall be apportioned to
4 this state on the basis of the arithmetical average of three factors
5 consisting of property, payroll and sales or gross revenue
6 enumerated as subparagraphs a, b and c of this paragraph. Net
7 income or loss as used in this paragraph includes that derived from
8 patent or copyright royalties, purchase discounts, and interest on
9 accounts receivable relating to or arising from a business activity,
10 the income from which is apportioned pursuant to this subsection,
11 including the sale or other disposition of such property and any
12 other property used in the unitary enterprise. Deductions used in
13 computing such net income or loss shall not include taxes based on
14 or measured by income. Provided, for corporations whose property
15 for purposes of the tax imposed by Section 2355 of this title has an
16 initial investment cost equaling or exceeding Two Hundred Million
17 Dollars ($200,000,000.00) and such investment is made on or after
18 July 1, 1997, or for corporations which expand their property or
19 facilities in this state and such expansion has an investment cost
20 equaling or exceeding Two Hundred Million Dollars ($200,000,000.00)
21 over a period not to exceed three (3) years, and such expansion is
22 commenced on or after January 1, 2000, the three factors shall be
23 apportioned with property and payroll, each comprising twenty-five
24 percent (25%) of the apportionment factor and sales comprising fifty
ENGR. S. B. NO. 299 Page 10

1 perc ent (50%) of the apportionment factor. The apportionment
2 factors shall be computed as follows:
3 a. The property factor is a fraction, the numerator of
4 which is the average value of the taxpayer’s real and
5 tangible personal property owned or rented and used in
6 this state during the tax period and the denominator
7 of which is the average value of all the taxpayer’s
8 real and tangible personal property everywhere owned
9 or rented and used during the tax period.
10 (1) Property, the income from which is separately
11 allocated in paragraph 4 of this subsection,
12 shall not be included in determining this
13 fraction. The numerator of the fraction shall
14 include a portion of the investment in
15 transportation and other equipment having no
16 fixed situs, such as rolling stock, buses, trucks
17 and trailers, including machinery and equipment
18 carried thereon, airplanes, salespersons’
19 automobiles and other similar equipment, in the
20 proportion that miles traveled in Oklahoma this
21 state by such equipment bears to total miles
22 traveled,
23 (2) Property owned by the taxpayer is valued at its
24 original cost. Property rented by the taxpayer
ENGR. S. B. NO. 299 Page 11

1 is valued at eight times the net annual rental
2 rate. Net annual rental rate is the annual
3 rental rate paid by the taxpayer, less any annual
4 rental rate received by the taxpayer from
5 subrentals,
6 (3) The average value of property shall be determined
7 by averaging the values at the beginning and
8 ending of the tax period but the Oklahoma Tax
9 Commission may require the averaging of monthly
10 values during the tax period if reasonably
11 required to reflect properly the average value of
12 the taxpayer’s property;
13 b. The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of
14 which is the total compensation for services rendered
15 in the state during the tax period, and the
16 denominator of which is the total compensation for
17 services rendered everywhere during the tax period.
18 “Compensation”, as used in this subsection, means
19 those paid-for services to the extent related to the
20 unitary business but does not include officers’
21 salaries, wages and other compensation.
22 (1) In the case of a transportation enterprise, the
23 numerator of the fraction shall include a portion
24 of such expenditure in connection with employees
ENGR. S. B. NO. 299 Page 12

1 operating equipment over a fixed route, such as
2 railroad employees, airline pilots, or bus
3 drivers, in this state only a part of the time,
4 in the proportion that mileage traveled in
5 Oklahoma this state bears to total mileage
6 traveled by such employees,
7 (2) In any case the numerator of the fraction shall
8 include a portion of such expenditures in
9 connection with itinerant employees, such as
10 traveling salespersons, in this state only a part
11 of the time, in the proportion that time spent in
12 Oklahoma this state bears to total time spent in
13 furtherance of the enterprise by such employees;
14 c. The sales factor is a fraction, the numerator of which
15 is the total sales or gross revenue of the taxpayer in
16 this state during the tax period, and the denominator
17 of which is the total sales or gross revenue of the
18 taxpayer everywhere during the tax period. “Sales”,
19 as used in this subsection, does not include sales or
20 gross revenue which are separately allocated in
21 paragraph 4 of this subsection.
22 (1) Sales of tangible personal property have a situs
23 in this state if the property is delivered or
24 shipped to a purchaser other than the United
ENGR. S. B. NO. 299 Page 13

1 States government, within this state regardless
2 of the FOB Freight on Board (FOB) point or other
3 conditions of the sale; or the property is
4 shipped from an office, store, warehouse,
5 factory, or other place of storage in this state
6 and (a) the purchaser is the United States
7 government or (b), for tax year 2025 and previous
8 tax years, the taxpayer is not doing business in
9 the state of the destination of the shipment.
10 (2) In the case of a railroad or interurban railway
11 enterprise, the numerator of the fraction shall
12 not be less than the allocation of revenues to
13 this state as shown in its annual report to the
14 Corporation Commission.
15 (3) In the case of an airline, truck or bus
16 enterprise or freight car, tank car, refrigerator
17 car or other railroad equipment enterprise, the
18 numerator of the fraction shall include a portion
19 of revenue from interstate transportation in the
20 proportion that interstate mileage traveled in
21 Oklahoma this state bears to total interstate
22 mileage traveled.
23 (4) In the case of an oil, gasoline or gas pipeline
24 enterprise, the numerator of the fraction shall
ENGR. S. B. NO. 299 Page 14

1 be either the total of traffic units of the
2 enterprise within Oklahoma this state or the
3 revenue allocated to Oklahoma this state based
4 upon miles moved, at the option of the taxpayer,
5 and the denominator of which shall be the total
6 of traffic units of the enterprise or the revenue
7 of the enterprise everywhere as appropriate to
8 the numerator. A “traffic unit” is hereby
9 defined as the transportation for a distance of
10 one (1) mile of one (1) barrel of oil, one (1)
11 gallon of gasoline or one thousand (1,000) cubic
12 feet of natural or casinghead gas, as the case
13 may be.
14 (5) In the case of a telephone or telegraph or other
15 communication enterprise, the numerator of the
16 fraction shall include that portion of the
17 interstate revenue as is allocated pursuant to
18 the accounting procedures prescribed by the
19 Federal Communications Commission; provided that
20 in respect to each corporation or business entity
21 required by the Federal Communications Commission
22 to keep its books and records in accordance with
23 a uniform system of accounts prescribed by such
24 Commission, the intrastate net income shall be
ENGR. S. B. NO. 299 Page 15

1 determined separately in the manner provided by
2 such uniform system of accounts and only the
3 interstate income shall be subject to allocation
4 pursuant to the provisions of this subsection.
5 Provided further, that the gross revenue factors
6 shall be those as are determined pursuant to the
7 accounting procedures prescribed by the Federal
8 Communications Commission.
9 In any case where the apportionment of the three factors
10 prescribed in this paragraph attributes to Oklahoma this state a
11 portion of net income of the enterprise out of all appropriate
12 proportion to the property owned and/or business transacted within
13 this state, because of the fact that one or more of the factors so
14 prescribed are not employed to any appreciable extent in furtherance
15 of the enterprise; or because one or more factors not so prescribed
16 are employed to a considerable extent in furtherance of the
17 enterprise; or because of other reasons, the Tax Commission is
18 empowered to permit, after a showing by taxpayer that an excessive
19 portion of net income has been attributed to Oklahoma this state, or
20 require, when in its judgment an insufficient portion of net income
21 has been attributed to Oklahoma this state, the elimination,
22 substitution, or use of additional factors, or reduction or increase
23 in the weight of such prescribed factors. Provided, however, that
24 any such variance from such prescribed factors which has the effect
ENGR. S. B. NO. 299 Page 16

1 of i ncreasing the portion of net income attributable to Oklahoma
2 this state must not be inherently arbitrary, and application of the
3 recomputed final apportionment to the net income of the enterprise
4 must attribute to Oklahoma this state only a reasonable portion
5 thereof.
6 6. For calendar years 1997 and 1998, the owner of a new or
7 expanded agricultural commodity processing facility in this state
8 may exclude from Oklahoma taxable income, or in the case of an
9 individual, the Oklahoma adjusted gross income, fifteen percent
10 (15%) of the investment by the owner in the new or expanded
11 agricultural commodity processing facility. For calendar year 1999,
12 and all subsequent years, the percentage, not to exceed fifteen
13 percent (15%), available to the owner of a new or expanded
14 agricultural commodity processing facility in this state claiming
15 the exemption shall be adjusted annually so that the total estimated
16 reduction in tax liability does not exceed One Million Dollars
17 ($1,000,000.00) annually. The Tax Commission shall promulgate rules
18 for determining the percentage of the investment which each eligible
19 taxpayer may exclude. The exclusion provided by this paragraph
20 shall be taken in the taxable year when the investment is made. In
21 the event the total reduction in tax liability authorized by this
22 paragraph exceeds One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) in any
23 calendar year, the Tax Commission shall permit any excess over One
24 Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) and shall factor such excess into
ENGR. S. B. NO. 299 Page 17

1 the percentage for subsequent years. Any amount of the exemption
2 permitted to be excluded pursuant to the provisions of this
3 paragraph but not used in any year may be carried forward as an
4 exemption from income pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph
5 for a period not exceeding six (6) years following the year in which
6 the investment was originally made.
7 For purposes of this paragraph:
8 a. “Agricultural commodity processing facility” means
9 building buildings, structures, fixtures and
10 improvements used or operated primarily for the
11 processing or production of marketable products from
12 agricultural commodities. The term shall also mean a
13 dairy operation that requires a depreciable investment
14 of at least Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars
15 ($250,000.00) and which produces milk from dairy cows.
16 The term does not include a facility that provides
17 only, and nothing more than, storage, cleaning, drying
18 or transportation of agricultural commodities, and
19 b. “Facility” means each part of the facility which is
20 used in a process primarily for:
21 (1) the processing of agricultural commodities,
22 including receiving or storing agricultural
23 commodities, or the production of milk at a dairy
24 operation,
ENGR. S. B. NO. 299 Page 18

1 (2) transporting the agricultural commodities or
2 product before, during or after the processing,
3 or
4 (3) packaging or otherwise preparing the product for
5 sale or shipment.
6 7. Despite any provision to the contrary in paragraph 3 of this
7 subsection, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1999, in
8 the case of a taxpayer which has a farming loss, such farming loss
9 shall be considered a net operating loss carryback in accordance
10 with and to the extent of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
11 amended, 26 U.S.C., Section 172(b)(G) 172(b)(1)(B). However, the
12 amount of the net operating loss carryback shall not exceed the
13 lesser of:
14 a. Sixty Thousand Dollars ($60,000.00), or
15 b. the loss properly shown on Schedule F of the Internal
16 Revenue Service Form 1040 reduced by one-half (1/2) of
17 the income from all other sources other than reflected
18 on Schedule F.
19 8. In taxable years beginning after December 31, 1995, all
20 qualified wages equal to the federal income tax credit set forth in
21 26 U.S.C.A., Section 45A, shall be deducted from taxable income.
22 The deduction allowed pursuant to this paragraph shall only be
23 permitted for the tax years in which the federal tax credit pursuant
24 to 26 U.S.C.A., Section 45A, is allowed. For purposes of this
ENGR. S. B. NO. 299 Page 19

1 para graph, “qualified wages” means those wages used to calculate the
2 federal credit pursuant to 26 U.S.C.A., Section 45A.
3 9. In taxable years beginning after December 31, 2005, an
4 employer that is eligible for and utilizes the Safety Pays OSHA

13 as amended by Section 1231 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment
14 Act of 2009 (P.L. No. 111-5). There shall be subtracted from

22 Oklahoma taxable income or adjusted gross income any item of loss or
23 deduction that in the absence of an election pursuant to the
24 provisions of the Pass-Through Entity Tax Equity Act of 2019 would
ENGR. S. B. NO. 299 Page 20

1 be a llocated to a member or to an indirect member of an electing
2 pass-through entity pursuant to Section 2351 et seq. of this title,
3 if (i) the electing pass-through entity has accounted for such item
4 in computing its Oklahoma net entity income or loss pursuant to the
5 provisions of the Pass-Through Entity Tax Equity Act of 2019, and
6 (ii) the total amount of tax attributable to any resulting Oklahoma
7 net entity income has been paid. The Oklahoma Tax Commission shall

10 this paragraph, “electing pass-through entity”, “indirect member”,
11 and “member” shall be defined in the same manner as prescribed by
12 Section 2355.1P-2 of this title. Notwithstanding the application of
13 this paragraph, the adjusted tax basis of any ownership interest in
14 a pass-through entity for purposes of Section 2351 et seq. of this
15 title shall be equal to its adjusted tax basis for federal income
16 tax purposes.
17 B. 1. The taxable income of any corporation shall be further
18 adjusted to arrive at Oklahoma taxable income, except those
19 corporations electing treatment as provided in subchapter S of the

3 allowed a deduction for depreciation of assets placed into service
4 after December 31, 1981, in accordance with provisions of the
5 Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, 26 U.S.C., Section 1 et
6 seq., in effect immediately prior to the enactment of the

13 Code of 1986, as amended, to the contrary, this subsection shall
14 control calculation of depreciation of assets placed into service

18 System was previously disallowed, an adjustment to taxable income is
19 required in the first taxable year beginning after December 31,
20 1982, to reconcile the basis of such assets to the basis allowed in
