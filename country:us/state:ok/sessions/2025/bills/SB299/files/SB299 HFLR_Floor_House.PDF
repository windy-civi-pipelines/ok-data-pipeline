4 separate commercial or business situs insofar as
5 undistributed income is concerned, but shall not
6 be treated as having a separate commercial or
7 business situs insofar as distributed income is
8 concerned,
9 (2) for taxable years beginning after December 31,
10 2003, capital or ordinary gains or losses from
11 the sale of an ownership interest in a publicly
12 traded partnership, as defined by Section 7704(b)
13 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,
14 shall be allocated to this state in the ratio of
15 the original cost of such partnership’s tangible
16 property in this state to the original cost of
17 such partnership’s tangible property everywhere,
18 as determined at the time of the sale; if more
19 than fifty percent (50%) of the value of the
20 partnership’s assets consists of intangible
21 assets, capital or ordinary gains or losses from

1 partnership for its first full tax period
2 immediately preceding its tax period during which

14 the Oklahoma net income shall, at the option of the
15 taxpayer, be that portion of the total net income of
16 the taxpayer for federal income tax purposes derived
17 from the manufacture and/or processing and sales
18 everywhere as determined by the ratio of the sales
19 defined in this section made to the purchaser within
20 the state to the total sales everywhere. The term

6 (1) except as otherwise provided by division (2) of
7 this subparagraph, taxable income of an insurance
8 company for a taxable year shall be apportioned
9 to this state by multiplying such income by a
10 fraction, the numerator of which is the direct
11 premiums written for insurance on property or

SB299 HFLR Page 8
BOLD FACE denotes Committee Amendments.

1 (2) if the principal source of premiums written by an
2 insurance company consists of premiums for
3 reinsurance accepted by it, the taxable income of
4 such company shall be apportioned to this state
5 by multiplying such income by a fraction, the
6 numerator of which is the sum of (a) direct
7 premiums written for insurance on property or
8 risks in this state, plus (b) premiums written
9 for reinsurance accepted in respect of property
10 or risks in this state, and the denominator of
11 which is the sum of (c) direct premiums written
12 for insurance on property or risks everywhere,
13 plus (d) premiums written for reinsurance
14 accepted in respect of property or risks
15 everywhere. For purposes of this paragraph,
16 premiums written for reinsurance accepted in
17 respect of property or risks in this state,
18 whether or not otherwise determinable, may at the
19 election of the company be determined on the
20 basis of the proportion which premiums written

23 bears to premiums written for reinsurance
24 accepted from all sources, or alternatively in
SB299 HFLR Page 9
BOLD FACE denotes Committee Amendments.

1 the proportion which the sum of the direct
2 premiums written for insurance on property or
3 risks in this state by each ceding company from
4 which reinsurance is accepted bears to the sum of
5 the total direct premiums written by each such
6 ceding company for the taxable year.
7 5. The net income or loss remaining after the separate
8 allocation in paragraph 4 of this subsection, being that which is
9 derived from a unitary business enterprise, shall be apportioned to
10 this state on the basis of the arithmetical average of three factors
11 consisting of property, payroll and sales or gross revenue
12 enumerated as subparagraphs a, b and c of this paragraph. Net
13 income or loss as used in this paragraph includes that derived from
14 patent or copyright royalties, purchase discounts, and interest on
15 accounts receivable relating to or arising from a business activity,
16 the income from which is apportioned pursuant to this subsection,
17 including the sale or other disposition of such property and any
18 other property used in the unitary enterprise. Deductions used in
19 computing such net income or loss shall not include taxes based on
20 or measured by income. Provided, for corporations whose property
21 for purposes of the tax imposed by Section 2355 of this title has an
22 initial investment cost equaling or exceeding Two Hundred Million
23 Dollars ($200,000,000.00) and such investment is made on or after
24 July 1, 1997, or for corporations which expand their property or
SB299 HFLR Page 10
BOLD FACE denotes Committee Amendments.

1 faci lities in this state and such expansion has an investment cost
2 equaling or exceeding Two Hundred Million Dollars ($200,000,000.00)
3 over a period not to exceed three (3) years, and such expansion is
4 commenced on or after January 1, 2000, the three factors shall be
5 apportioned with property and payroll, each comprising twenty-five
6 percent (25%) of the apportionment factor and sales comprising fifty
7 percent (50%) of the apportionment factor. The apportionment
8 factors shall be computed as follows:
9 a. The property factor is a fraction, the numerator of
10 which is the average value of the taxpayer’s real and
11 tangible personal property owned or rented and used in
12 this state during the tax period and the denominator
13 of which is the average value of all the taxpayer’s
14 real and tangible personal property everywhere owned
15 or rented and used during the tax period.
16 (1) Property, the income from which is separately
17 allocated in paragraph 4 of this subsection,
18 shall not be included in determining this
19 fraction. The numerator of the fraction shall
20 include a portion of the investment in
21 transportation and other equipment having no
22 fixed situs, such as rolling stock, buses, trucks
23 and trailers, including machinery and equipment
24 carried thereon, airplanes, salespersons’
SB299 HFLR Page 11
BOLD FACE denotes Committee Amendments.

1 automobiles and other similar equipment, in the
2 proportion that miles traveled in Oklahoma this
3 state by such equipment bears to total miles
4 traveled,
5 (2) Property owned by the taxpayer is valued at its
6 original cost. Property rented by the taxpayer
7 is valued at eight times the net annual rental
8 rate. Net annual rental rate is the annual
9 rental rate paid by the taxpayer, less any annual
10 rental rate received by the taxpayer from
11 subrentals,
12 (3) The average value of property shall be determined
13 by averaging the values at the beginning and
14 ending of the tax period but the Oklahoma Tax
15 Commission may require the averaging of monthly
16 values during the tax period if reasonably
17 required to reflect properly the average value of
18 the taxpayer’s property;
19 b. The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of
20 which is the total compensation for services rendered
21 in the state during the tax period, and the
22 denominator of which is the total compensation for
23 services rendered everywhere during the tax period.
24 “Compensation”, as used in this subsection, means
SB299 HFLR Page 12
BOLD FACE denotes Committee Amendments.

1 those paid-for services to the extent related to the
2 unitary business but does not include officers’
3 salaries, wages and other compensation.
4 (1) In the case of a transportation enterprise, the
5 numerator of the fraction shall include a portion
6 of such expenditure in connection with employees
7 operating equipment over a fixed route, such as
8 railroad employees, airline pilots, or bus
9 drivers, in this state only a part of the time,
10 in the proportion that mileage traveled in
11 Oklahoma this state bears to total mileage
12 traveled by such employees,
13 (2) In any case the numerator of the fraction shall
14 include a portion of such expenditures in
15 connection with itinerant employees, such as
16 traveling salespersons, in this state only a part
17 of the time, in the proportion that time spent in
18 Oklahoma this state bears to total time spent in
19 furtherance of the enterprise by such employees;
20 c. The sales factor is a fraction, the numerator of which
21 is the total sales or gross revenue of the taxpayer in
22 this state during the tax period, and the denominator
23 of which is the total sales or gross revenue of the
24 taxpayer everywhere during the tax period. “Sales”,
SB299 HFLR Page 13
BOLD FACE denotes Committee Amendments.

1 as used in this subsection, does not include sales or
2 gross revenue which are separately allocated in
3 paragraph 4 of this subsection.
4 (1) Sales of tangible personal property have a situs
5 in this state if the property is delivered or
6 shipped to a purchaser other than the United
7 States government, within this state regardless
8 of the FOB Freight on Board (FOB) point or other
9 conditions of the sale; or the property is
10 shipped from an office, store, warehouse,
11 factory, or other place of storage in this state
12 and (a) the purchaser is the United States
13 government or (b), for tax year 2025 and previous
14 tax years, the taxpayer is not doing business in
15 the state of the destination of the shipment.
16 (2) In the case of a railroad or interurban railway
17 enterprise, the numerator of the fraction shall
18 not be less than the allocation of revenues to
19 this state as shown in its annual report to the
20 Corporation Commission.
21 (3) In the case of an airline, truck or bus
22 enterprise or freight car, tank car, refrigerator
23 car or other railroad equipment enterprise, the
24 numerator of the fraction shall include a portion
SB299 HFLR Page 14
BOLD FACE denotes Committee Amendments.

1 of revenue from interstate transportation in the
2 proportion that interstate mileage traveled in
3 Oklahoma this state bears to total interstate
4 mileage traveled.
5 (4) In the case of an oil, gasoline or gas pipeline
6 enterprise, the numerator of the fraction shall
7 be either the total of traffic units of the
8 enterprise within Oklahoma this state or the
9 revenue allocated to Oklahoma this state based
10 upon miles moved, at the option of the taxpayer,
11 and the denominator of which shall be the total
12 of traffic units of the enterprise or the revenue
13 of the enterprise everywhere as appropriate to
14 the numerator. A “traffic unit” is hereby
15 defined as the transportation for a distance of
16 one (1) mile of one (1) barrel of oil, one (1)
17 gallon of gasoline or one thousand (1,000) cubic
18 feet of natural or casinghead gas, as the case
19 may be.
20 (5) In the case of a telephone or telegraph or other
21 communication enterprise, the numerator of the
22 fraction shall include that portion of the
23 interstate revenue as is allocated pursuant to
24 the accounting procedures prescribed by the
SB299 HFLR Page 15
BOLD FACE denotes Committee Amendments.

1 Federal Communications Commission; provided that
2 in respect to each corporation or business entity
3 required by the Federal Communications Commission
4 to keep its books and records in accordance with
5 a uniform system of accounts prescribed by such
6 Commission, the intrastate net income shall be
7 determined separately in the manner provided by
8 such uniform system of accounts and only the
9 interstate income shall be subject to allocation
10 pursuant to the provisions of this subsection.
11 Provided further, that the gross revenue factors
12 shall be those as are determined pursuant to the
13 accounting procedures prescribed by the Federal
14 Communications Commission.
15 In any case where the apportionment of the three factors
16 prescribed in this paragraph attributes to Oklahoma this state a
17 portion of net income of the enterprise out of all appropriate
18 proportion to the property owned and/or business transacted within
19 this state, because of the fact that one or more of the factors so
20 prescribed are not employed to any appreciable extent in furtherance
21 of the enterprise; or because one or more factors not so prescribed
22 are employed to a considerable extent in furtherance of the
23 enterprise; or because of other reasons, the Tax Commission is
24 empowered to permit, after a showing by taxpayer that an excessive
SB299 HFLR Page 16
BOLD FACE denotes Committee Amendments.

1 port ion of net income has been attributed to Oklahoma this state, or
2 require, when in its judgment an insufficient portion of net income
3 has been attributed to Oklahoma this state, the elimination,
4 substitution, or use of additional factors, or reduction or increase
5 in the weight of such prescribed factors. Provided, however, that
6 any such variance from such prescribed factors which has the effect
7 of increasing the portion of net income attributable to Oklahoma
8 this state must not be inherently arbitrary, and application of the
9 recomputed final apportionment to the net income of the enterprise
10 must attribute to Oklahoma this state only a reasonable portion
11 thereof.
12 6. For calendar years 1997 and 1998, the owner of a new or
13 expanded agricultural commodity processing facility in this state
14 may exclude from Oklahoma taxable income, or in the case of an
15 individual, the Oklahoma adjusted gross income, fifteen percent
16 (15%) of the investment by the owner in the new or expanded
17 agricultural commodity processing facility. For calendar year 1999,
18 and all subsequent years, the percentage, not to exceed fifteen
19 percent (15%), available to the owner of a new or expanded
20 agricultural commodity processing facility in this state claiming
21 the exemption shall be adjusted annually so that the total estimated
22 reduction in tax liability does not exceed One Million Dollars
23 ($1,000,000.00) annually. The Tax Commission shall promulgate rules
24 for determining the percentage of the investment which each eligible
SB299 HFLR Page 17
BOLD FACE denotes Committee Amendments.

1 taxp ayer may exclude. The exclusion provided by this paragraph
2 shall be taken in the taxable year when the investment is made. In
3 the event the total reduction in tax liability authorized by this
4 paragraph exceeds One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) in any
5 calendar year, the Tax Commission shall permit any excess over One
6 Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) and shall factor such excess into
7 the percentage for subsequent years. Any amount of the exemption
8 permitted to be excluded pursuant to the provisions of this
9 paragraph but not used in any year may be carried forward as an
10 exemption from income pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph
11 for a period not exceeding six (6) years following the year in which
12 the investment was originally made.
13 For purposes of this paragraph:
14 a. “Agricultural commodity processing facility” means
15 building buildings, structures, fixtures and
16 improvements used or operated primarily for the
17 processing or production of marketable products from
18 agricultural commodities. The term shall also mean a

22 The term does not include a facility that provides
23 only, and nothing more than, storage, cleaning, drying
24 or transportation of agricultural commodities, and
SB299 HFLR Page 18
BOLD FACE denotes Committee Amendments.

1 b. “Facility” means each part of the facility which is
2 used in a process primarily for:

13 subsection, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1999, in
14 the case of a taxpayer which has a farming loss, such farming loss
15 shall be considered a net operating loss carryback in accordance
16 with and to the extent of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
17 amended, 26 U.S.C., Section 172(b)(G) 172(b)(1)(B). However, the
18 amount of the net operating loss carryback shall not exceed the
19 lesser of:
20 a. Sixty Thousand Dollars ($60,000.00), or
21 b. the loss properly shown on Schedule F of the Internal

2 qualified wages equal to the federal income tax credit set forth in
3 26 U.S.C.A., Section 45A, shall be deducted from taxable income.
4 The deduction allowed pursuant to this paragraph shall only be
5 permitted for the tax years in which the federal tax credit pursuant
6 to 26 U.S.C.A., Section 45A, is allowed. For purposes of this
7 paragraph, “qualified wages” means those wages used to calculate the
8 federal credit pursuant to 26 U.S.C.A., Section 45A.
