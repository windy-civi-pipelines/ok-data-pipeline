5 video; and
6 3. “Synthetic media” means an image, audio recording, or video
7 recording of an individual’s appearance, speech, or conduct that has
8 been created or intentionally manipulated with the use of generative

11 or video.
12 B. Except as provided in subsection C of this section, a
13 person, corporation, committee, or other entity shall not, within
14 ninety (90) days of an election at which a candidate for elective
15 office will appear on the ballot, create or originally distribute
16 synthetic media that the person, corporation, committee, or other
17 entity has actual knowledge is a deepfake of a candidate or
18 political party on the state or local ballot.
19 C. 1. The prohibition in subsection B of this section shall

4 average viewer. For visual media that is video, the disclosure
5 shall appear for the duration of the video.
6 3. If the media consists of audio only, the disclosure shall be
7 read in a clearly spoken manner and in a pitch that can be easily

10 in length, interspersed within the audio at intervals of not greater
11 than two (2) minutes each.
