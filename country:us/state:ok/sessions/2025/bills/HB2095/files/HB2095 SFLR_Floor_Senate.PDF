17 may production of a current request for records be unreasonably
18 delayed until after completion of a prior records request that will
19 take substantially longer than the current request. Any public body
20 which makes the requested records available on the Internet shall
21 meet the obligation of providing prompt, reasonable access to its
22 records as required by this paragraph. Public bodies shall respond
