1 A. The Oklahoma Water Resources Board shall require all permit
2 holders authorized to take and use groundwater to implement a system
3 of measuring groundwater usage from all wells associated with the
4 permit. The Board shall determine which measurement systems may be
5 utilized, which shall include, but not be limited to, pump and
6 irrigation monitoring telemetry devices capable of reporting usage.
7 Such measuring systems shall be in proper operating conditions at
8 all times when groundwater is being produced. Data from the
9 measuring system shall be utilized for the annual groundwater use
10 report.
11 B. To encourage groundwater conservation, beginning January 1,
12 2026, the Board shall provide a five-year flex allocation of
13 groundwater usage based off the previously determined allocated
14 annual use of the basin or subbasin. A five-year flex allocation
15 shall not require a new permit for existing permit holders. A five-
16 year flex allocation shall be available for:
17 1. Existing permit holders for groundwater use permits in

11 allocation; provided, that the applicant shall adhere to the
