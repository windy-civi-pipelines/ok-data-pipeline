pursuant to Section 18-200.1 of this title, the weighted average
daily membership for the first year of operation of a new charter
school site or grade level or full-time statewide virtual charter
school shall be determined initially by multiplying the actual
enrollment of students as of August 1 by 1.333. The charter school
or virtual charter school shall receive revenue equal to that which
would be generated by the estimated weighted average daily
membership calculated pursuant to this subsection. At midyear, the
allocation for the charter school or virtual charter school shall be
adjusted using the first quarter weighted average daily membership
for the charter school or virtual charter school calculated pursuant
to subsection A of this section. For each subsequent school year,
weighted average daily membership shall be calculated as provided

school or virtual charter school shall be considered a local
education agency for purposes of funding.

charter school may be reserved and used for future purposes. The
governing board of a charter school or virtual charter school shall
not levy taxes or issue bonds. If otherwise allowed by law, the
governing board of a charter school or virtual charter school may
enter into private contracts for the purposes of borrowing money
from lenders. If the governing board of the charter school or
virtual charter school borrows money, the charter school or virtual
charter school shall be solely responsible for repaying the debt,
