amended to read as follows:
Section 8-105. A. When a tie vote is certified in the
nomination or election of any candidate in any Runoff Primary,
General Election, or any Primary Election, the election board which
that is authorized by law to issue the certified list or certificate
of election shall, at a public meeting of the board and in the
presence of the candidates involved or their designee, if they or

B. When a nominee or electee is to be selected by lot pursuant
to the provisions of this section, the following procedures shall be
observed:
1. The secretary of the appropriate election board shall, on or
before the tenth day following the election, notify each of the
tying candidates for which the vote was tied. The notice shall
include the time, date, and location of the selection, shall be made

in writing by registered or certified mail, and shall be postmarked
not fewer than five (5) days prior to the meeting;

full view of those present at the meeting, clearly write or print
the name of each tied candidate on separate pieces of paper
measuring approximately equal size. The names of the candidates

The papers shall be folded in half one time so that the written

container shall be declared the winner. The secretary secretary’s
designee shall then expose the other name or names not drawn to all
witnesses present; and

between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m.

first place occurs for the nomination of a candidate at a Primary
Election for which a Runoff Primary will be held, the names of the
tied candidates shall be placed on the Runoff Primary ballot.
D. The procedures prescribed in this section shall not apply to
elections of state officers pursuant to Section 5 of Article VI of
the Oklahoma Constitution.
