17 the member may return to teaching. Any member retired before July
18 1, 1992, shall be eligible to receive the monthly retirement benefit
19 herein provided, but such payment shall not begin until the first
20 payment due to the member after July 1, 1992, and shall not be
21 retroactive. The Board of Trustees is empowered to make such rules
22 and regulations as it considers proper to preserve equity in
23 retirements under this provision, which shall include a provision to
24 protect the rights of the member’s spouse.

2 disability retirement shall have the total monthly payment deducted
3 from the member’s accumulated contributions plus interest earned and
4 any money remaining in the member’s account after the above
5 deductions at the death of the member shall be paid in a lump sum to
6 the beneficiary or to the estate of the member. Provided, if the
7 deceased disabled member had thirty (30) years or more of creditable
8 service and the death occurred after June 30, 1981, and death
9 occurred prior to the disabled member receiving twelve monthly
10 retirement payments, a surviving spouse may elect to receive the
11 retirement benefit to which the deceased member would have been
12 entitled at the time of death under the Option 2 Plan of Retirement
13 provided for in paragraph 2 of subsection K of this section in lieu
14 of the death benefit provided for in this paragraph and in
15 subsection Q of this section.
16 3. Once each year the System may require any disabled annuitant

18 medical examination, such examination to be made at the place of
19 residence for the disabled annuitant or other place mutually agreed
20 upon by a physician or physicians designated by the System. Should
21 any disabled annuitant who has not yet attained the age of sixty
22 (60) years refuse to submit to at least one medical examination in
23 any such year by a physician or physicians designated by the System,
24
Req. No. 10046 Page 13
RBH No. 10046
1 the member’s benefits may be discontinued until the member submits
2 to such examination.
3 4. Should the Medical Board report and certify to the Board of
4 Trustees that such disabled annuitant is engaged in or is able to
5 engage in a gainful occupation paying more than the difference
6 between the member’s average final compensation and the annual
7 benefit amount, and should the Board of Trustees concur in such
8 report, then the amount of the member’s annual benefit shall be
9 reduced to an amount which, added to the member’s earnings from a
10 gainful occupation, shall equal the amount of the member’s average
11 final compensation. Should the member’s earning capacity be later
12 increased, the amount of the member’s annual benefit may be further
13 reduced.
14 5. Should a disabled annuitant be restored to active service,
15 the member’s disability retirement benefit shall cease and the
16 member shall again become an active member of the Teachers’
17 Retirement System of Oklahoma and shall make regular contributions
18 as required under this article. The unused portion of the member’s
19 accumulated contributions shall be reestablished to the member’s
20 credit in the Teachers’ Savings Fund. Any such prior service
21 certificates on the basis of which the member’s service was computed
22 at the time of the member’s retirement shall be restored to full
23 force and effect.

2 seq. of this title make application for withdrawal duly filed with
3 the System, not earlier than four (4) months after the date of
4 termination of employment with a participating employer within the
5 System, the contribution standing to the credit of the member’s
6 individual account in the Teachers’ Savings Fund shall be paid to
7 the member or, in the event of the member’s death before retirement,
8 shall be paid to such person or persons as the member shall have
9 designated in a manner required by the Board of Trustees and filed
10 with the System; provided, however, if there is no designated
11 beneficiary surviving upon such death, such contributions shall be
12 paid to the member’s administrators, executors, or assigns, together
13 with interest as hereinafter provided. Provided further, if there
14 is no designated beneficiary surviving upon such death, and the
15 contributions standing to the credit of such member do not exceed
16 Two Hundred Dollars ($200.00), no part of such contributions shall
17 be subject to the payment of any expense of the last illness or
18 funeral of the deceased member or any expense of administration of
19 the estate of such deceased and the System, upon satisfactory proof
20 of the death of such member and of the name or names of the person
21 or persons who would be entitled to receive such contributions under
22 the laws of descent and distribution of the state, may authorize the
23 payment of accumulated contributions to such person or persons. A
24 member terminating membership by withdrawal after June 30, 2003,

16 certificate being filed by the member notifying the Teachers’
17 Retirement System of Oklahoma of the death of the joint annuitant

14 subsection J of this section by having the trustee of the trust
15 established for the benefit of that individual named as the legal
16 beneficiary or joint annuitant under subsection J of this section.

18 benefit payable to the trust under subsection J of this section.

8 beneficiary of a trust under one of the Trust Acts described herein
9 after that time, the System will acknowledge the trust as the
10 beneficiary upon the submission of adequate documentation of the
11 existence of the trust. All other provisions of subsection J of
12 this section shall apply to these subsequently created trusts.
13 4. The Board of Trustees of the System may recognize other
14 trusts set up for the benefit of individuals otherwise eligible to
15 be named as a beneficiary or joint annuitant under subsection J of
16 this section by administrative rule if it can be done without undue
17 additional administrative expense of the System.

3 amounts as the governing board of any such public school, in its
4 judgment, shall determine to be reasonable and appropriate in view
5 of the length and type of service rendered by any such person to
6 such public school by which such person was employed at the time of
7 retirement. All such additional payments shall be uniform, based
8 upon the length of service and the type of services performed, to
9 persons formerly employed by such public school who have retired or
10 been retired in accordance with the provisions of Section 17-101 et
11 seq. of this title.

10 electing beneficiary based upon creditable service performed by the
11 deceased member, which are provided pursuant to this subsection, may

19 herein provided, but such payment shall not begin until the first
20 payment due to the member after July 1, 1992, and shall not be

13 provided for in paragraph 2 of subsection K of this section in lieu
14 of the death benefit provided for in this paragraph and in

20 upon by a physician or physicians designated by the System. Should
21 any disabled annuitant who has not yet attained the age of sixty
22 (60) years refuse to submit to at least one medical examination in
23 any such year by a physician or physicians designated by the System,

4 Trustees that such disabled annuitant is engaged in or is able to
5 engage in a gainful occupation paying more than the difference
6 between the member’s average final compensation and the annual
7 benefit amount, and should the Board of Trustees concur in such
8 report, then the amount of the member’s annual benefit shall be
9 reduced to an amount which, added to the member’s earnings from a
10 gainful occupation, shall equal the amount of the member’s average
11 final compensation. Should the member’s earning capacity be later
12 increased, the amount of the member’s annual benefit may be further
13 reduced.
14 5. Should a disabled annuitant be restored to active service,
15 the member’s disability retirement benefit shall cease and the
16 member shall again become an active member of the Teachers’

7 the member or, in the event of the member’s death before retirement,
8 shall be paid to such person or persons as the member shall have
9 designated in a manner required by the Board of Trustees and filed
10 with the System; provided, however, if there is no designated
11 beneficiary surviving upon such death, such contributions shall be
12 paid to the member’s administrators, executors, or assigns, together
13 with interest as hereinafter provided. Provided further, if there
14 is no designated beneficiary surviving upon such death, and the
15 contributions standing to the credit of such member do not exceed
16 Two Hundred Dollars ($200.00), no part of such contributions shall
17 be subject to the payment of any expense of the last illness or
18 funeral of the deceased member or any expense of administration of
19 the estate of such deceased and the System, upon satisfactory proof
20 of the death of such member and of the name or names of the person
21 or persons who would be entitled to receive such contributions under
22 the laws of descent and distribution of the state, may authorize the

18 within six (6) months of the date of death, nothing in this
19 subsection shall require the Teachers’ Retirement System of Oklahoma
20 to pay more than six (6) months of retrospective benefits increase.
21 K. 1. Option 1. A member takes a slightly reduced retirement
22 allowance for life. If the member dies before receiving in annuity

14 subsection J of this section by having the trustee of the trust
15 established for the benefit of that individual named as the legal
16 beneficiary or joint annuitant under subsection J of this section.
17 The age of that beneficiary shall be used for calculating any
18 benefit payable to the trust under subsection J of this section.

8 beneficiary of a trust under one of the Trust Acts described herein
9 after that time, the System will acknowledge the trust as the
10 beneficiary upon the submission of adequate documentation of the

4 judgment, shall determine to be reasonable and appropriate in view
5 of the length and type of service rendered by any such person to

7 retirement. All such additional payments shall be uniform, based
8 upon the length of service and the type of services performed, to
9 persons formerly employed by such public school who have retired or
10 been retired in accordance with the provisions of Section 17-101 et

8 benefits in the amount not to exceed Eighteen Thousand Dollars
9 ($18,000.00), but exclusive of any retirement benefit received by an
10 electing beneficiary based upon creditable service performed by the
11 deceased member, which are provided pursuant to this subsection, may
12 elect to disclaim such death benefits in which case such benefits
13 will be transferred to a person licensed as a funeral director or to
14 a lawfully recognized business entity licensed as required by law to
15 provide funeral services for the deceased member. The qualified
