2 rating of a child care program with a capacity of fifty or more, the
3 comprehensive visit to inspect and examine the program shall be
4 scheduled with the administration of the program at least one (1)
5 week in advance of the visit, if requested by the child care
6 facility.
7 B. 1. The State Department of Health may visit any licensee or
8 applicant at the request of the Department to advise on matters

15 C. 1. Upon receipt of a complaint against any child care
16 facility alleging a violation of the provisions of the Oklahoma
17 Child Care Facilities Licensing Act, or any licensing standard
18 promulgated by the Department, the Department shall conduct a full
19 investigation. If upon investigation, it is determined that there

21 the Oklahoma Child Care Facilities Licensing Act or of any standard
22 or rule promulgated pursuant thereto, the Department shall:
23 a. document the complaint,

2 facility involved and, upon written request by the
3 child care facility, provide a summary of the facts
4 used to evaluate the completed complaint, and
5 c. document the facility's plan for correcting any
6 substantiated violations.
7 2. If the Department determines there has been a violation and
8 the violation has a direct impact on the health, safety or well-
9 being of one or more of the children cared for by the facility, the
10 Department shall notify the facility and require correction of the
11 violation.
12 3. The Department shall notify the facility that failure to
13 correct the confirmed violation can result in the revocation of the
14 license, the denial of an application for a license, the issuance of
15 an emergency order or the filing of an injunction pursuant to the
16 provisions of Section 409 of this title.
17 4. If the facility refuses to correct a violation or fails to
18 complete the plan of correction, the Department may issue an
19 emergency order, revoke the license, or deny the application for a
20 license. Nothing in this section or Section 407 of this title shall
21 be construed as preventing the Department from denying an
22 application, revoking a license, or issuing an emergency order for a
23 single violation of this act, or the rules of the Department as
24 provided in Section 404 of this title.

1 5. If the Department determines there has been a substantiated
2 finding of heinous and shocking abuse by a person responsible for a

4 Section 1-1-105 of Title 10A of the Oklahoma Statutes, the
5 Department shall notify the child care facility owner or operator
6 and the child care resource and referral organization in writing
7 immediately or not later than one (1) business day after the
8 substantiated finding. Upon receiving notice of a substantiated
9 finding, the facility owner or operator shall attempt to immediately
10 notify, but not later than seventy-two (72) hours after receiving
11 notice of the substantiated finding, parents or legal guardians of
12 children attending the facility by certified mail.

18 the report of the investigation. The findings shall state whether
19 the complaint was substantiated or unsubstantiated. The report

21 regardless of whether the facility owner's or operator's license is
22 active or inactive.

3 privileged communications, shall be properly safeguarded, and shall
4 not be accessible to anyone except as herein provided, unless upon

6 provision shall not prohibit the Department from providing a summary
7 of allegations and findings of an investigation involving a child
8 care facility that does not disclose identities but that permits
9 parents to evaluate the facility.
10 F. The Department shall promulgate rules to establish and
11 maintain a grievance process that shall include an anonymous
12 complaint system for reporting and investigating complaints or
13 grievances about employees of the Department who retaliate against a
