2 week in advance of the visit, if requested by the child care
3 facility.
4 B. 1. The State Department of Health may visit any licensee or

12 C. 1. Upon receipt of a complaint against any child care
13 facility alleging a violation of the provisions of the Oklahoma
14 Child Care Facilities Licensing Act, or any licensing standard
15 promulgated by the Department, the Department shall conduct a full
16 investigation. If upon investigation, it is determined that there
17 are reasonable grounds to believe that a facility is in violation of
18 the Oklahoma Child Care Facilities Licensing Act or of any standard
19 or rule promulgated pursuant thereto, the Department shall:
20 a. document the complaint,

1 c. document the facility's plan for correcting any
2 substantiated violations.
3 2. If the Department determines there has been a violation and

6 Department shall notify the facility and require correction of the
7 violation.
8 3. The Department shall notify the facility that failure to

10 license, the denial of an application for a license, the issuance of
11 an emergency order or the filing of an injunction pursuant to the
12 provisions of Section 409 of this title.
13 4. If the facility refuses to correct a violation or fails to
14 complete the plan of correction, the Department may issue an
15 emergency order, revoke the license, or deny the application for a
16 license. Nothing in this section or Section 407 of this title shall
17 be construed as preventing the Department from denying an
18 application, revoking a license, or issuing an emergency order for a
19 single violation of this act, or the rules of the Department as
20 provided in Section 404 of this title.
21 5. If the Department determines there has been a substantiated

8 children attending the facility by certified mail.
9 D. Upon the completion of the investigation of a complaint
10 against any child care facility alleging a violation of the
11 provisions of the Oklahoma Child Care Facilities Licensing Act or
12 any licensing standard promulgated thereto by the Department, the
13 Department shall clearly designate its findings on the first page of
14 the report of the investigation. The findings shall state whether
15 the complaint was substantiated or unsubstantiated. The report
16 shall remain available in a manner that is accessible to the public,
17 regardless of whether the facility owner's or operator's license is
18 active or inactive.
19 E. Information obtained by the Department or Oklahoma Child
20 Care Services concerning a report of a violation of a licensing
21 requirement, or from any licensee regarding children or their
22 parents or other relatives shall be deemed confidential and
23 privileged communications, shall be properly safeguarded, and shall
24 not be accessible to anyone except as herein provided, unless upon
Req. No. 11239 Page 4

1 orde r of a court of competent jurisdiction. Provided, however, this
2 provision shall not prohibit the Department from providing a summary
3 of allegations and findings of an investigation involving a child
4 care facility that does not disclose identities but that permits
5 parents to evaluate the facility.
6 F. The Department shall promulgate rules to establish and
7 maintain a grievance process that shall include an anonymous
8 complaint system for reporting and investigating complaints or
9 grievances about employees of the Department who retaliate against a
10 child care facility or facility employee.
