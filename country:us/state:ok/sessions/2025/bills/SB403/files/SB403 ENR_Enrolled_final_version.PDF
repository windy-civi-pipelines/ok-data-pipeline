1. The county purchasing agent shall request written
recommendations from all county officers pertaining to needed or

services, equipment, and information technology and
telecommunication goods and services. From such recommendations and
available requisition, purchase, or inventory records, the county
purchasing agent shall prepare a list of items needed or commonly
used by county officers. The county purchasing agent shall request
from the Purchasing Division or from the Information Services
Division in the case of information technology and telecommunication

the purchase for the county or the county purchasing agent shall
solicit bids for unit prices on the items for periods of not to
exceed twelve (12) months in the manner described in paragraph 2 of
this subsection. If the county purchasing agent receives a
requisition for an item for which the county purchasing agent does
not have a current bid, the county purchasing agent shall request
from the Purchasing Division or the Information Services Division of
the Office of Management and Enterprise Services, as applicable, all
contracts quoting the price the state is paying for the item. The
county purchasing agent shall either request the Purchasing Division
or the Information Services Division of the Office of Management and
Enterprise Services, as applicable, to make the purchase for the
county or the county purchasing agent shall solicit bids in the
manner described in paragraph 2 of this subsection. Nothing in this
paragraph shall prohibit bids from being taken on an item currently
on a twelve-month bid list, at any time deemed necessary by the
county purchasing agent. Whenever the county purchasing agent deems
it necessary to take a bid on an item currently on a twelve-month
bid list, the reason for the bid shall be entered into the minutes
of the board of county commissioners;
2. Bids shall be solicited by mailing or emailing a notice to
all persons or firms who have made a written request of the county
purchasing agent that they be notified of such bid solicitation and
to all other persons or firms who might reasonably be expected to
submit bids. Notice of solicitation of bids shall also be published
one time in a newspaper of general circulation in the county.
ENR. S. B. NO. 403 Page 8

Notices shall be mailed and published at least ten (10) days prior
to the date on which the bids are opened. Proof of the mailing or
emailing shall be made by the affidavit of the person mailing or
emailing the request for bids and shall be made a part of the
official records of the county purchasing agent. The notice shall
specify whether the county will consider written bids, electronic
bids, or both; the decision to exclusively consider either written
bids or electronic bids shall be determined pursuant to an
affirmative vote of the board of county commissioners. Whenever any
prospective supplier or vendor dealing in or listing for sale any
particular item or article required to be purchased or acquired by
sealed bids fails to enter or offer a sealed bid for three
successive bid solicitations, the name of the supplier or vendor may
be dropped from the mailing lists of the board of county
commissioners;

price received from the applicable Division division of the Office
of Management and Enterprise Services shall be given to the county
clerk by the county purchasing agent. The county clerk shall
forward the sealed bids and state contract price, if any, to the
board of county commissioners;
4. The board of county commissioners, in an open meeting, shall
open the sealed bids and compare them to the state contract price.
The board of county commissioners shall select the lowest and best
bid based upon, if applicable, the availability of material and
transportation cost to the job site within thirty (30) days of the
meeting. For any special item not included on the list of needed or
commonly used items, the requisitioning official shall review the
bids and submit a written recommendation to the board before final
approval. The board of county commissioners shall keep a written
record of the meeting as required by law, and any time the lowest
bid was not considered to be the lowest and best bid, the reason for
such conclusion shall be recorded. Whenever the board of county
commissioners rejects the written recommendation of the
requisitioning official pertaining to a special item, the reasons
for the rejection shall be entered in their minutes and stated in a
letter to the requisitioning official and county purchasing agent;
5. The county purchasing agent shall notify the successful
bidders and shall maintain a copy of the notification. The county
ENR. S. B. NO. 403 Page 9

purchasing agent shall prepare and maintain a vendors list
specifying the successful bidders and shall notify each county
officer of the list. The county purchasing agent may remove any
vendor from such list who refuses to provide goods or services as
provided by contract if the removal is authorized by the board of
county commissioners. The county purchasing agent may make
purchases from the successful remaining bidders for a price at or
below the bid price. If a vendor who is the low bidder cannot or
will not sell goods or services as required by a county bid
contract, the county purchasing agent may make a one-time purchase
from the next lowest or best quote or take quotations as provided in
paragraph 6 of this subsection; provided, however, such purchase
does not exceed Twenty-five Thousand Dollars ($25,000.00) as the
amount specified in subparagraph a of paragraph 3 of subsection A of
Section 1501 of this title; and
6. When bids have been solicited as provided for by law and no
bids have been received, the procedure shall be as follows:
a. the county purchasing agent shall determine if
potential vendors are willing to commit to a firm
price for a reduced period of time, and, if such is
the case, the bid procedure described in this
subsection shall be followed,
b. if vendors are not willing to commit to a firm price
for a reduced period, the purchasing agent shall
solicit and record at least three quotes of current
prices available to the county and authorize the
purchase of goods or services based on the lowest and
best quote as it becomes necessary to acquire such
goods or services. The quotes shall be recorded on a
form prescribed by the State Auditor and Inspector and
shall be attached to the purchase order and filed with
the county clerk’s copy of the purchase order. Any
time the lowest quote was not considered to be the
lowest and best quote, the reason for this conclusion
shall be recorded by the county purchasing agent and
transmitted to the county clerk, or
c. if three quotes are not available, a memorandum to the
county clerk from the county purchasing agent shall
ENR. S. B. NO. 403 Page 10

describe the basis upon which a purchase is
authorized. The memorandum shall state the reasons
why the price for such a purchase is the lowest and
best under the circumstances. The county clerk shall
then attach the memorandum to the county clerk’s copy
of the purchase order and file both in the office of
the county clerk.
C. After selection of a vendor, the procedure for the purchase,
lease-purchase, or rental of supplies, materials, road and bridge
construction services, equipment, and information technology and
telecommunication goods and services used by a county shall be as
follows:
1. The county purchasing agent shall prepare a purchase order
in quadruplicate and submit it with a copy of the requisition to the
county clerk;

the purchase order and assign a sequential number to the purchase

certified by the county clerk; and
4. The county clerk shall file the original purchase order and
return three copies to the county purchasing agent who shall file a
copy, retain a copy for the county road and bridge inventory officer
if the purchase order is for the purchase of equipment, supplies, or
