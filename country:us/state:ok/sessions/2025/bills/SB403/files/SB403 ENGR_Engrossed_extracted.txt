7 goods or services. The quotes shall be recorded on a
8 form prescribed by the State Auditor and Inspector and
9 shall be attached to the purchase order and filed with

16 county clerk from the county purchasing agent shall
17 describe the basis upon which a purchase is

16 bids and submit a written recommendation to the board before final
17 approval. The board of county commissioners shall keep a written
18 record of the meeting as required by law, and any time the lowest

20 such conclusion shall be recorded. Whenever the board of county
21 commissioners rejects the written recommendation of the
22 requisitioning official pertaining to a special item, the reasons

7 provided by contract if the removal is authorized by the board of
8 county commissioners. The county purchasing agent may make
9 purchases from the successful remaining bidders for a price at or
10 below the bid price. If a vendor who is the low bidder cannot or
11 will not sell goods or services as required by a county bid
12 contract, the county purchasing agent may make a one-time purchase
13 from the next lowest or best quote or take quotations as provided in
14 paragraph 6 of this subsection; provided, however, such purchase
15 does not exceed Twenty-five Thousand Dollars ($25,000.00) as the
16 amount specified in subparagraph a of paragraph 3 of subsection A of
17 Section 1501 of this title; and
18 6. When bids have been solicited as provided for by law and no
19 bids have been received, the procedure shall be as follows:

22 price for a reduced period of time, and, if such is
23 the case, the bid procedure described in this
24 subsection shall be followed,
ENGR. S. B. NO. 403 Page 14

1 b. if vendors are not willing to commit to a firm price
2 for a reduced period, the purchasing agent shall
3 solicit and record at least three quotes of current
4 prices available to the county and authorize the
5 purchase of goods or services based on the lowest and
6 best quote as it becomes necessary to acquire such
7 goods or services. The quotes shall be recorded on a
8 form prescribed by the State Auditor and Inspector and
9 shall be attached to the purchase order and filed with
10 the county clerk’s copy of the purchase order. Any
11 time the lowest quote was not considered to be the
12 lowest and best quote, the reason for this conclusion
13 shall be recorded by the county purchasing agent and
14 transmitted to the county clerk, or
15 c. if three quotes are not available, a memorandum to the
16 county clerk from the county purchasing agent shall
17 describe the basis upon which a purchase is
18 authorized. The memorandum shall state the reasons
19 why the price for such a purchase is the lowest and
20 best under the circumstances. The county clerk shall
21 then attach the memorandum to the county clerk’s copy
22 of the purchase order and file both in the office of
23 the county clerk.
24
ENGR. S. B. NO. 403 Page 15

1 C. After selection of a vendor, the procedure for the purchase,

3 construction services, equipment, and information technology and
4 telecommunication goods and services used by a county shall be as
5 follows:
6 1. The county purchasing agent shall prepare a purchase order
7 in quadruplicate and submit it with a copy of the requisition to the
8 county clerk;
9 2. The county clerk shall then encumber the amount stated on
10 the purchase order and assign a sequential number to the purchase
11 order;
12 3. If there is an unencumbered balance in the appropriation
13 made for that purpose by the county excise board, the county clerk
14 shall so certify in the following form:
