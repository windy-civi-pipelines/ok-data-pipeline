gg. in addition to other sentencing powers of the court,
the court in the case of a defendant being sentenced
for a felony conviction for a violation of Section 2-

Additionally, the court may require the offender to

hh.
ii. any other provision specifically ordered by the court.
However, any such order for restitution, community service,
payment to a local certified crime stoppers program, payment to the
Oklahoma Reward System or confinement in the county jail, or a
combination thereof, shall be made in conjunction with probation and
shall be made a condition of the suspended sentence.
However, unless under the supervision of the district attorney,
the offender shall be required to pay Forty Dollars ($40.00) per
month to the district attorney during the first two (2) years of
probation to compensate the district attorney for the costs incurred
during the prosecution of the offender and for the additional work
of verifying the compliance of the offender with the rules and
conditions of his or her probation. The district attorney may waive
any part of this requirement in the best interests of justice. The
court shall not waive, suspend, defer or dismiss the costs of
prosecution in its entirety. However, if the court determines that
a reduction in the fine, costs and costs of prosecution is
warranted, the court shall equally apply the same percentage
reduction to the fine, costs and costs of prosecution owed by the
offender;
2. Impose a fine prescribed by law for the offense, with or

provisions of paragraph 1 of subsection A of this section shall not
apply to defendants being sentenced upon their third or subsequent
to their third conviction of a felony. Provided, the court may
waive these prohibitions upon written application of the district
attorney. Both the application and the waiver shall be made part of
the record of the case.
D. When sentencing a person convicted of a crime, the judge
shall consider any victim impact statements if submitted to the
jury, or the judge in the event a jury is waived.

and subject to supervision by the Department of Corrections, a
private supervision provider or other person designated by the
court. Such supervision shall be initiated upon an order of
probation from the court, and shall not exceed two (2) years, unless
a petition alleging a violation of any condition of deferred
judgment or seeking revocation of the suspended sentence is filed
during the supervision, or as otherwise provided by law. In the
case of a person convicted of a sex offense, supervision shall begin
immediately upon release from incarceration or if parole is granted
and shall not be limited to two (2) years. Provided further, any
supervision provided for in this section may be extended for a
period not to exceed the expiration of the maximum term or terms of
the sentence upon a determination by the court or the Division of
Probation and Parole of the Department of Corrections that the best
interests of the public and the release will be served by an
extended period of supervision.

court may designate, shall be responsible for the monitoring and

set appropriate compensation to the county for services to the
Department.

Database. Any defendant sentenced to probation shall be required to
submit to testing within thirty (30) days of sentencing either to
the Department of Corrections or to the county sheriff or other
peace officer as directed by the court. Defendants who are
sentenced to a term of incarceration shall submit to testing in
accordance with Section 530.1 of Title 57 of the Oklahoma Statutes,
for those defendants who enter the custody of the Department of
Corrections or to the county sheriff, for those defendants sentenced
to incarceration in a county jail. Convicted individuals who have
previously submitted to DNA testing under this section and for whom
a valid sample is on file in the OSBI Combined DNA Index System
(CODIS) Database at the time of sentencing shall not be required to
submit to additional testing. Except as required by the Sex
Offenders Registration Act, a deferred judgment does not require
submission to DNA testing.
Any person who is incarcerated in the custody of the Department

appears for testing or within ten (10) days of the date the subject
comes into physical custody to serve a term of incarceration. All
collectors of DNA samples shall use sample kits provided by the OSBI
and procedures promulgated by the OSBI. Persons subject to DNA
testing who are not received at the Lexington Assessment and
Reception Center shall be required to pay a fee of Fifteen Dollars
($15.00) to the agency collecting the sample for submission to the
OSBI Combined DNA Index System (CODIS) Database. Any fees collected
pursuant to this subsection shall be deposited in the revolving

department.
K. When sentencing a person who has been convicted of a crime
that would subject that person to the provisions of the Sex
Offenders Registration Act, neither the court nor the district
attorney shall be allowed to waive or exempt such person from the
registration requirements of the Sex Offenders Registration Act.
SECTION 2. AMENDATORY 22 O.S. 2021, Section 991b, is
amended to read as follows:
Section 991b. A. Whenever a sentence has been suspended by the
court after conviction of a person for any crime, the suspended
sentence of the person may not be revoked, in whole or part, for any
cause unless a petition setting forth the grounds for such
revocation is filed by the district attorney with the clerk of the
sentencing court and competent evidence justifying the revocation of
the suspended sentence is presented to the court at a hearing to be
held for that purpose within twenty (20) days after the entry of the
plea of not guilty to the petition, unless waived by both the state
and the defendant. The State of Oklahoma may dismiss the petition
without prejudice one time upon good cause shown to the court,
provided that any successor petition must be filed within forty-five
(45) days of the date of the dismissal of the petition.
B. Whenever a sentence has been suspended by the court after
conviction of a person for any crime, the suspended sentence of the
ENR. H. B. NO. 1462 Page 19

person may not be revoked in whole for a technical violation unless
a petition setting forth the grounds for such revocation is filed by
the district attorney with the clerk of the sentencing court and
competent evidence justifying the revocation of the suspended
sentence is presented to the court at a hearing to be held for that
purpose within twenty (20) days after the entry of the plea of not
guilty to the petition, unless waived by both the state and the
defendant. The State of Oklahoma may dismiss the petition without
prejudice one time upon good cause shown to the court; provided,
that any successor petition must be filed within forty-five (45)
days of the date of the dismissal of the petition. Any revocation
of a suspended sentence based on a technical violation shall not
exceed six (6) months for a first revocation and five (5) years for
a second or subsequent revocation.
C. "Technical violation" as used in this section means a
violation of the court-imposed rules and conditions of probation,
other than:
1. Committing or being arrested for a new crime;
2. Attempting to falsify a drug screen, or three or more failed
drug or alcohol screens within a three-month period;
3. Failing to pay restitution;
4. Tampering with an electronic monitoring device;
5. Failing to initially report or missing assigned reporting
requirements for an excess of sixty (60) days;
6. Unlawfully contacting a victim, codefendant or criminal
associates;
7. Five or more separate and distinct technical violations
within a ninety-day period; or
8. Any violation of the Specialized Sex Offender Rules.
D. 1. The Department of Corrections shall develop a matrix of
technical violations and sanctions to address violations committed
by persons who are being supervised by the Department. The
Department shall be authorized to use a violation response and
intermediate sanction process based on the sanction matrix to apply
to any technical violations of probationers. Within four (4)
ENR. H. B. NO. 1462 Page 20

working days of the discovery of the violation, the probation
officer shall initiate the violation response and intermediate
sanction process. The sentencing judge may authorize any
recommended sanctions, which may include, but are not limited to:
short-term jail or lockup, day treatment, program attendance,
community service, outpatient or inpatient treatment, monetary
fines, curfews, ignition interlock devices on vehicles, or a one-
time referral to a term of confinement of six (6) months in an
intermediate revocation facility operated by the Department of
Corrections; provided, upon approval of the district attorney, a
person may be sanctioned to serve additional terms of confinement in
an intermediate revocation facility. The probation officer shall
complete a sanction form, which shall specify the technical
violation, sanction, and the action plan to correct the noncompliant
behavior resulting in the technical violation. The probation
officer shall refer to the sanctioning matrix to determine the
supervision, treatment, and sanctions appropriate to address the
noncompliant behavior. The probation officer shall refer the
violation information and recommended response with a sanction plan
to the Department of Corrections to be heard by a hearing officer.
The Department of Corrections shall develop a sanction matrix,
forms, policies and procedures necessary to implement this
provision. The Department of Corrections shall establish procedures
to hear responses to technical violations and review sanction plans
including the following:
a. hearing officers shall report through a chain of
command separate from that of the supervising
probation officers,
b. the Department shall provide the offender written
notice of the violation, the evidence relied upon, and
the reason the sanction was imposed,
c. the hearing shall be held unless the offender waives
the right to the hearing,
d. hearings shall be electronically recorded, and
e. the Department shall provide to judges and district
attorneys a record of all violations and actions taken
pursuant to this subsection.
2. The hearing officer shall determine based on a preponderance
of the evidence whether a technical violation occurred. Upon a
ENR. H. B. NO. 1462 Page 21

finding that a technical violation occurred, the hearing officer may
order the offender to participate in the recommended sanction plan
or may modify the plan. Offenders who accept the sanction plan
shall sign a violation response sanction form, and the hearing
officer shall then impose the sanction. Failure of the offender to
comply with the imposed sanction plan shall constitute a violation
of the rules and conditions of supervision that may result in a
revocation proceeding. If an offender does not voluntarily accept
the recommended sanction plan, the Department shall either impose
the sanction and allow the offender to appeal to the district court,
or request a revocation proceeding as provided by law. Every
administrative hearing and sanction imposed by the Department shall
be appealable to the district court.
3. Absent a finding of willful nonpayment by the offender, the
failure of an offender to pay fines and costs may not serve as a
basis for revocation, excluding restitution.
E. 1. Where one of the grounds for revocation is the failure
of the defendant to make restitution as ordered, the Department of
Corrections shall forward to the district attorney all information
pertaining to the failure of the defendant to make timely
restitution as ordered by the court, and the district attorney shall
file a petition setting forth the grounds for revocation.
2. The defendant ordered to make restitution can petition the
court at any time for remission or a change in the terms of the
order of restitution if the defendant undergoes a change of
condition which materially affects the ability of the defendant to
comply with the order of the court.
3. At the hearing, if one of the grounds for the petition for
revocation is the failure of the defendant to make timely
restitution as ordered by the court, the court will hear evidence
and if it appears to the satisfaction of the court from such
evidence that the terms of the order of restitution create a
manifest hardship on the defendant or the immediate family of the
defendant, the court may cancel all or any part of the amount still
due, or modify the terms or method of payment; provided, however,
the court shall continue to prioritize an order for payments of
restitution to the victim. Provided, if the court determines that a
reduction in the restitution still due is warranted, the court shall
equally apply the same percentage reduction to any court-ordered
monetary obligation owed by the defendant including, but not limited
to, fines, court costs and costs of incarceration.
ENR. H. B. NO. 1462 Page 22

F. The court may revoke a portion of the sentence and leave the
remaining part not revoked, but suspended for the remainder of the
term of the sentence, and under the provisions applying to it. The
person whose suspended sentence is being considered for revocation
at the hearing shall have the right to be represented by counsel, to
present competent evidence in his or her own behalf and to be
confronted by the witnesses against the defendant. Any order of the
court revoking the suspended sentence, in whole or in part, shall be
subject to review on appeal, as in other appeals of criminal cases.
Provided, however, that if the crime for which the suspended
sentence is given was a felony, the defendant may be allowed bail
pending appeal. If the reason for revocation be that the defendant
committed a felony, the defendant shall not be allowed bail pending
appeal.
G. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections A and B of
this section, when the suspended sentence of a person is being
considered for revocation for an offense where the penalty has
subsequently been lowered to a misdemeanor, the sentence shall be
modified to a term that does not exceed the current maximum
sentence.
SECTION 3. AMENDATORY 22 O.S. 2021, Section 991f, is
amended to read as follows:
Section 991f. A. For the purposes of any provision of Title 22
of the Oklahoma Statutes relating to criminal sentencing and
restitution orders and for the Restitution and Diversion Program:
1. "Restitution" means the sum to be paid by the defendant to
the victim of the criminal act to compensate that victim for up to
three times the amount of the economic loss suffered as a direct
result of the criminal act of the defendant;
2. "Victim" means any person, partnership, corporation or legal
entity that suffers an economic loss as a direct result of the
criminal act of another person;
3. "Economic loss" means actual financial detriment suffered by
the victim consisting of medical expenses actually incurred, damage
to or loss of real and personal property and any other out-of-pocket
expenses, including loss of earnings, reasonably incurred as the
direct result of the criminal act of the defendant. No other
ENR. H. B. NO. 1462 Page 23

elements of damage shall be included as an economic loss for
purposes of this section.
B. In all criminal prosecutions and juvenile proceedings in
this state, when the court shall prioritize an order for payments of
restitution to the victim. When the court enters an order directing
the offender to pay restitution to any victim for economic loss or
to pay to the state any fines, fees or assessments, the order, for
purposes of validity and collection, shall not be limited to the
maximum term of imprisonment for which the offender could have been
sentenced, nor limited to any term of probation, parole, or
extension thereof, nor expire until fully satisfied. The court
order for restitution, fines, fees or assessments shall remain a
continuing obligation of the offender until fully satisfied, and the
obligation shall not be considered a debt, nor shall the obligation
be dischargeable in any bankruptcy proceeding. The court order
shall continue in full force and effect with the supervision of the
state until fully satisfied, and the state shall use all methods of
collection authorized by law. Before acceptance of a payment toward
fines, fees, or assessments, the court clerk shall inquire of the
offender whether restitution is owed on the case. If the court has
ordered restitution, the court clerk shall inform the offender that
payment of such restitution shall be prioritized over payment of
fines, fees, or assessments.
C. 1. Upon conviction for any crime wherein property has been
stolen, converted or otherwise unlawfully obtained, or its value
substantially decreased as a direct result of the crime, or wherein
the crime victim suffered injury, loss of income, or out-of-pocket
loss, the individuals criminally responsible shall be sentenced to
make restitution. Restitution may be ordered in addition to the
punishments prescribed by law.
2. The court shall order full restitution based upon the
following considerations:
a. the nature and amount of restitution shall be
sufficient to restore the crime victim to the
equivalent economic status existing prior to the
losses sustained as a direct result of the crime, and
may allow the crime victim to receive payment in
excess of the losses sustained; provided, the excess
amount of restitution shall not be more than treble
the actual economic loss incurred, and
ENR. H. B. NO. 1462 Page 24

b. the amount of restitution shall be established
regardless of the financial resources of the offender.
3. The court:
a. may direct the return of property to be made as soon
as practicable and make an award of restitution in the
amount of the loss of value to the property itself as
a direct result of the crime, including out-of-pocket
expenses and loss of earnings incurred as a result of
damage to or loss of use of the property, the cost to
return the property to the victim or to restore the
property to its pre-crime condition whichever may be
appropriate under the circumstances,
b. may order restitution in a lump sum or by such
schedules as may be established and thereafter
adjusted by agreement consistent with the order of the
court,
c. shall have the authority to amend or alter any order
of restitution made pursuant to this section providing
that the court shall state its reasons and conclusions
as a matter of record for any change or amendment to
any previous order,
d. may order interest upon any ordered restitution sum to
accrue at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum
until the restitution is paid in full. The court may
further order such interest to be paid to the victims
of the crime or proportion the interest payment
between the victims and the court fund, and/or the
Restitution and Diversion Program, in the discretion
of the court, and
e. shall consider any pre-existing orders imposed on the
defendant, including, but not limited to, orders
imposed under civil and criminal proceedings.
D. If restitution to more than one person, agency or entity is
set at the same time, the court shall establish the following
priorities of payment:
1. The crime victim or victims; and
ENR. H. B. NO. 1462 Page 25

2. Any other government agency which has provided reimbursement
to the victim as a result of the offender's criminal conduct.
E. 1. The district attorney's office shall present the crime
victim's restitution claim to the court at the time of the
conviction of the offender or the restitution provisions shall be
included in the written plea agreement presented to the court, in
which case, the restitution claim shall be reviewed by the judge
prior to acceptance of the plea agreement.
2. At the initiation of the prosecution of the defendant, the
district attorney's office shall provide all identifiable crime
victims with written and oral information explaining their rights
and responsibilities to receive restitution established under this
section.
3. The district attorney's office shall provide all crime
victims, regardless of whether the crime victim makes a specific
request, with an official request for restitution form to be
completed and signed by the crime victim, and to include all
invoices, bills, receipts, and other evidence of injury, loss of
earnings and out-of-pocket loss. This form shall be filed with any
victim impact statement to be included in the judgment and sentence.
Every crime victim receiving the restitution claim form shall be
provided assistance and direction to properly complete the form.
4. The official restitution request form shall be presented in
all cases regardless of whether the case is brought to trial. In a
plea bargain, the district attorney in every case where the victim
has suffered economic loss, shall, as a part of the plea bargain,
require that the offender pay restitution to the crime victim. The
district attorney shall be authorized to act as a clearing house for
collection and disbursement of restitution payments made pursuant to
this section, and shall assess a fee of One Dollar ($1.00) per
payment received from the defendant, except when the defendant is
sentenced to incarceration in the Department of Corrections.
F. The crime victim shall provide all documentation and
evidence of compensation or reimbursement from insurance companies
or agencies of this state, any other state, or the federal
government received as a direct result of the crime for injury, loss
of earnings or out-of-pocket loss.
G. The court shall, upon motion by the crime victim, redact
from the submitted documentation all personal information relating
ENR. H. B. NO. 1462 Page 26

to the crime victim that does not directly and necessarily establish
the authenticity of any document or substantiate the asserted amount
of the restitution claim.
H. The unexcused failure or refusal of the crime victim to
provide all or part of the requisite information prior to the
sentencing, unless disclosure is deferred by the court, shall
constitute a waiver of any grounds to appeal or seek future
amendment or alteration of the restitution order predicated on the
undisclosed available information. The court shall order the
offender to submit either as part of the pre-sentence investigation
or assessment and evaluation required for a community sentence or,
if no pre-sentence investigation is conducted, in advance of the
sentencing proceeding such information as the court may direct and
finds necessary to be disclosed for the purpose of ascertaining the
type and manner of restitution to be ordered.
I. The willful failure or refusal of the offender to provide
all or part of the requisite information prior to the sentencing,
unless disclosure is deferred by the court shall not deprive the
court of the authority to set restitution or set the schedule of
payment. The willful failure or refusal of the offender to provide
all or part of the requisite information prior to the sentencing,
unless disclosure is deferred by the court, shall constitute a
waiver of any grounds to appeal or seek future amendment or
alteration of the restitution order predicated on the undisclosed
information. The willful failure or refusal of the offender to
provide all or part of the requisite information prior to
sentencing, unless disclosure is deferred by the court, shall
constitute an act of contempt.
J. The court shall conduct such hearings or proceedings as it
deems necessary to set restitution and payment schedules at the time
of sentencing or may bifurcate the sentencing and defer the hearing
or proceedings relating to the imposition of restitution as justice
may require. Amendments or alterations to the restitution order may
be made upon the court's own motion, petition by the crime victim or
petition by the offender.
K. An offender who files a meritless or frivolous petition for
amendment or alteration to the restitution order shall pay the costs
of the proceeding on the petition and shall have added to the
existing restitution order the additional loss of earnings and out-
of-pocket loss incurred by the crime victim in responding to the
petition.
ENR. H. B. NO. 1462 Page 27

L. The restitution request form shall be promulgated by the
District Attorneys Council and provided to all district attorney
offices.
M. If a defendant who is financially able refuses or neglects
to pay restitution as ordered by this section, payment may be
enforced:
1. By contempt of court as provided in subsection A of Section
566 of Title 21 of the Oklahoma Statutes with imprisonment or fine
or both;
2. In the same manner as prescribed in subsection N of this
section for a defendant who is without means to make such
restitution payment; or
3. Revocation of the criminal sentence if the sentence imposed
was a suspended or deferred sentence or a community sentence.
N. If the defendant is without means to pay the restitution,
the judge may direct the total amount due, or any portion thereof,
to be entered upon the court minutes and to be certified in the
district court of the county where it shall then be entered upon the
district court judgment docket and shall have the full force and
effect of a district court judgment in a civil case. Thereupon the
same remedies shall be available for the enforcement of the judgment
as are available to enforce other judgments; provided, however, the
judgment herein prescribed shall not be considered a debt nor
dischargeable in any bankruptcy proceeding.
O. Whenever a person has been ordered to pay restitution as
provided in this section or any section of the Oklahoma Statutes for
a criminal penalty, the judge may order the defendant to a term of
community service, with or without compensation, to be credited at a
rate of Five Dollars ($5.00) per day against the total amount due
for restitution. If the defendant fails to perform the required
community service authorized by this subsection or if the conditions
of community service are violated, the judge may impose a term of
imprisonment not to exceed five (5) days in the county jail for each
failure to comply.
P. Nothing in subsections M through O of this section shall be
construed to be additions to the original criminal penalty, but
shall be used by the court as sanctions and means of collection for
ENR. H. B. NO. 1462 Page 28

criminal restitution orders and restitution orders that have been
reduced to judgment.
SECTION 4. This act shall become effective November 1, 2025.
