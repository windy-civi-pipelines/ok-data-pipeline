7 Section 3-460 of Title 43A of the Oklahoma Statutes. The evaluation
8 shall be conducted at a certified assessment agency, the office of a
9 certified assessor or at another location as ordered by the court.
10 The agency or assessor shall, within seventy-two (72) hours from the
11 time the person is assessed, submit a written report to the court
12 for the purpose of assisting the court in its final sentencing
13 determination. No person, agency or facility operating an alcohol

9 evaluation required by this subsection.
10 C. When sentencing a person convicted of a crime, the court
11 shall first consider a program of restitution for the victim, as
12 well as imposition of a fine or incarceration of the offender. The
13 provisions of paragraph 1 of subsection A of this section shall not
14 apply to defendants being sentenced upon their third or subsequent
15 to their third conviction of a felony. Provided, the court may
16 waive these prohibitions upon written application of the district

5 probation from the court, and shall not exceed two (2) years, unless
6 a petition alleging a violation of any condition of deferred
7 judgment or seeking revocation of the suspended sentence is filed
8 during the supervision, or as otherwise provided by law. In the
9 case of a person convicted of a sex offense, supervision shall begin
10 immediately upon release from incarceration or if parole is granted
11 and shall not be limited to two (2) years. Provided further, any
12 supervision provided for in this section may be extended for a
13 period not to exceed the expiration of the maximum term or terms of
14 the sentence upon a determination by the court or the Division of
15 Probation and Parole of the Department of Corrections that the best
16 interests of the public and the release will be served by an
17 extended period of supervision.
18 F. The Department of Corrections, or such other agency as the
19 court may designate, shall be responsible for the monitoring and
20 administration of the restitution and service programs provided for
21 by subparagraphs a, c and d of paragraph 1 of subsection A of this

20 amended to read as follows:
21 Section 991b. A. Whenever a sentence has been suspended by the
22 court after conviction of a person for any crime, the suspended
23 sentence of the person may not be revoked, in whole or part, for any
24 cause unless a petition setting forth the grounds for such
Req. No. 12662 Page 31

1 revo cation is filed by the district attorney with the clerk of the
2 sentencing court and competent evidence justifying the revocation of
3 the suspended sentence is presented to the court at a hearing to be
4 held for that purpose within twenty (20) days after the entry of the
5 plea of not guilty to the petition, unless waived by both the state
6 and the defendant. The State of Oklahoma may dismiss the petition
7 without prejudice one time upon good cause shown to the court,
8 provided that any successor petition must be filed within forty-five
9 (45) days of the date of the dismissal of the petition.
10 B. Whenever a sentence has been suspended by the court after
11 conviction of a person for any crime, the suspended sentence of the
12 person may not be revoked in whole for a technical violation unless
13 a petition setting forth the grounds for such revocation is filed by
14 the district attorney with the clerk of the sentencing court and
15 competent evidence justifying the revocation of the suspended
16 sentence is presented to the court at a hearing to be held for that
17 purpose within twenty (20) days after the entry of the plea of not
18 guilty to the petition, unless waived by both the state and the
19 defendant. The State of Oklahoma may dismiss the petition without
20 prejudice one time upon good cause shown to the court; provided,
21 that any successor petition must be filed within forty-five (45)
22 days of the date of the dismissal of the petition. Any revocation
23 of a suspended sentence based on a technical violation shall not
24
Req. No. 12662 Page 32

1 exce ed six (6) months for a first revocation and five (5) years for
2 a second or subsequent revocation.
3 C. "Technical violation" as used in this section means a
4 violation of the court-imposed rules and conditions of probation,
5 other than:
6 1. Committing or being arrested for a new crime;
7 2. Attempting to falsify a drug screen, or three or more failed
8 drug or alcohol screens within a three-month period;
9 3. Failing to pay restitution;
10 4. Tampering with an electronic monitoring device;
11 5. Failing to initially report or missing assigned reporting
12 requirements for an excess of sixty (60) days;
13 6. Unlawfully contacting a victim, codefendant or criminal
14 associates;
15 7. Five or more separate and distinct technical violations
16 within a ninety-day period; or
17 8. Any violation of the Specialized Sex Offender Rules.
18 D. 1. The Department of Corrections shall develop a matrix of
19 technical violations and sanctions to address violations committed
20 by persons who are being supervised by the Department. The
21 Department shall be authorized to use a violation response and
22 intermediate sanction process based on the sanction matrix to apply
23 to any technical violations of probationers. Within four (4)
24 working days of the discovery of the violation, the probation
Req. No. 12662 Page 33

1 offi cer shall initiate the violation response and intermediate
2 sanction process. The sentencing judge may authorize any
3 recommended sanctions, which may include, but are not limited to:
4 short-term jail or lockup, day treatment, program attendance,
5 community service, outpatient or inpatient treatment, monetary
6 fines, curfews, ignition interlock devices on vehicles, or a one-
7 time referral to a term of confinement of six (6) months in an
8 intermediate revocation facility operated by the Department of
9 Corrections; provided, upon approval of the district attorney, a
10 person may be sanctioned to serve additional terms of confinement in
11 an intermediate revocation facility. The probation officer shall
12 complete a sanction form, which shall specify the technical
13 violation, sanction, and the action plan to correct the noncompliant
14 behavior resulting in the technical violation. The probation
15 officer shall refer to the sanctioning matrix to determine the
16 supervision, treatment, and sanctions appropriate to address the
17 noncompliant behavior. The probation officer shall refer the
18 violation information and recommended response with a sanction plan
19 to the Department of Corrections to be heard by a hearing officer.
20 The Department of Corrections shall develop a sanction matrix,
21 forms, policies and procedures necessary to implement this
22 provision. The Department of Corrections shall establish procedures
23 to hear responses to technical violations and review sanction plans
24 including the following:
Req. No. 12662 Page 34

1 a. hearing officers shall report through a chain of
2 command separate from that of the supervising
3 probation officers,
4 b. the Department shall provide the offender written
5 notice of the violation, the evidence relied upon, and
6 the reason the sanction was imposed,
7 c. the hearing shall be held unless the offender waives
8 the right to the hearing,
9 d. hearings shall be electronically recorded, and
10 e. the Department shall provide to judges and district
11 attorneys a record of all violations and actions taken
12 pursuant to this subsection.
13 2. The hearing officer shall determine based on a preponderance
14 of the evidence whether a technical violation occurred. Upon a
15 finding that a technical violation occurred, the hearing officer may
16 order the offender to participate in the recommended sanction plan
17 or may modify the plan. Offenders who accept the sanction plan
18 shall sign a violation response sanction form, and the hearing
19 officer shall then impose the sanction. Failure of the offender to
20 comply with the imposed sanction plan shall constitute a violation
21 of the rules and conditions of supervision that may result in a
22 revocation proceeding. If an offender does not voluntarily accept
23 the recommended sanction plan, the Department shall either impose
24 the sanction and allow the offender to appeal to the district court,
Req. No. 12662 Page 35

1 or r equest a revocation proceeding as provided by law. Every
2 administrative hearing and sanction imposed by the Department shall
3 be appealable to the district court.
4 3. Absent a finding of willful nonpayment by the offender, the
5 failure of an offender to pay fines and costs may not serve as a
6 basis for revocation, excluding restitution.
7 E. 1. Where one of the grounds for revocation is the failure
8 of the defendant to make restitution as ordered, the Department of
9 Corrections shall forward to the district attorney all information
10 pertaining to the failure of the defendant to make timely
11 restitution as ordered by the court, and the district attorney shall
12 file a petition setting forth the grounds for revocation.
13 2. The defendant ordered to make restitution can petition the
14 court at any time for remission or a change in the terms of the
15 order of restitution if the defendant undergoes a change of
16 condition which materially affects the ability of the defendant to
17 comply with the order of the court.
18 3. At the hearing, if one of the grounds for the petition for
19 revocation is the failure of the defendant to make timely
20 restitution as ordered by the court, the court will hear evidence
21 and if it appears to the satisfaction of the court from such
22 evidence that the terms of the order of restitution create a
23 manifest hardship on the defendant or the immediate family of the
24 defendant, the court may cancel all or any part of the amount still
Req. No. 12662 Page 36

1 due, or modify the terms or method of payment; provided, however,
2 the court shall continue to prioritize an order for payments of
3 restitution to the victim. Provided, if the court determines that a
4 reduction in the restitution still due is warranted, the court shall
5 equally apply the same percentage reduction to any court-ordered
6 monetary obligation owed by the defendant including, but not limited
7 to, fines, court costs and costs of incarceration.
8 F. The court may revoke a portion of the sentence and leave the
9 remaining part not revoked, but suspended for the remainder of the
10 term of the sentence, and under the provisions applying to it. The
11 person whose suspended sentence is being considered for revocation
12 at the hearing shall have the right to be represented by counsel, to
13 present competent evidence in his or her own behalf and to be
14 confronted by the witnesses against the defendant. Any order of the
15 court revoking the suspended sentence, in whole or in part, shall be
16 subject to review on appeal, as in other appeals of criminal cases.
17 Provided, however, that if the crime for which the suspended
18 sentence is given was a felony, the defendant may be allowed bail
19 pending appeal. If the reason for revocation be that the defendant
20 committed a felony, the defendant shall not be allowed bail pending
21 appeal.
22 G. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections A and B of
23 this section, when the suspended sentence of a person is being
24 considered for revocation for an offense where the penalty has
Req. No. 12662 Page 37

1 subs equently been lowered to a misdemeanor, the sentence shall be
2 modified to a term that does not exceed the current maximum
3 sentence.
4 SECTION 3. AMENDATORY 22 O.S. 2021, Section 991f, is
5 amended to read as follows:

22 purposes of this section.
23 B. In all criminal prosecutions and juvenile proceedings in
24 this state, when the court shall prioritize an order for payments of
Req. No. 12662 Page 38

1 rest itution to the victim. When the court enters an order directing
2 the offender to pay restitution to any victim for economic loss or
3 to pay to the state any fines, fees or assessments, the order, for
4 purposes of validity and collection, shall not be limited to the
5 maximum term of imprisonment for which the offender could have been
6 sentenced, nor limited to any term of probation, parole, or
7 extension thereof, nor expire until fully satisfied. The court
8 order for restitution, fines, fees or assessments shall remain a
9 continuing obligation of the offender until fully satisfied, and the

18 stolen, converted or otherwise unlawfully obtained, or its value
19 substantially decreased as a direct result of the crime, or wherein

21 loss, the individuals criminally responsible shall be sentenced to
22 make restitution. Restitution may be ordered in addition to the
23 punishments prescribed by law.
24
Req. No. 12662 Page 39

1 2. The court shall order full restitution based upon the
2 following considerations:
3 a. the nature and amount of restitution shall be
4 sufficient to restore the crime victim to the
5 equivalent economic status existing prior to the
6 losses sustained as a direct result of the crime, and
7 may allow the crime victim to receive payment in
8 excess of the losses sustained; provided, the excess
9 amount of restitution shall not be more than treble
10 the actual economic loss incurred, and
11 b. the amount of restitution shall be established
12 regardless of the financial resources of the offender.
13 3. The court:
14 a. may direct the return of property to be made as soon
15 as practicable and make an award of restitution in the
16 amount of the loss of value to the property itself as
17 a direct result of the crime, including out-of-pocket
18 expenses and loss of earnings incurred as a result of
19 damage to or loss of use of the property, the cost to
20 return the property to the victim or to restore the
21 property to its pre-crime condition whichever may be
22 appropriate under the circumstances,
23 b. may order restitution in a lump sum or by such
24 schedules as may be established and thereafter
Req. No. 12662 Page 40

4 of restitution made pursuant to this section providing
5 that the court shall state its reasons and conclusions
6 as a matter of record for any change or amendment to
7 any previous order,
8 d. may order interest upon any ordered restitution sum to
9 accrue at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum
10 until the restitution is paid in full. The court may
11 further order such interest to be paid to the victims
12 of the crime or proportion the interest payment
13 between the victims and the court fund, and/or the
14 Restitution and Diversion Program, in the discretion
15 of the court, and
16 e. shall consider any pre-existing orders imposed on the
17 defendant, including, but not limited to, orders
18 imposed under civil and criminal proceedings.
19 D. If restitution to more than one person, agency or entity is
20 set at the same time, the court shall establish the following
21 priorities of payment:
22 1. The crime victim or victims; and
23 2. Any other government agency which has provided reimbursement
24 to the victim as a result of the offender's criminal conduct.
Req. No. 12662 Page 41

1 E. 1. The district attorney's office shall present the crime
2 victim's restitution claim to the court at the time of the
3 conviction of the offender or the restitution provisions shall be
4 included in the written plea agreement presented to the court, in
5 which case, the restitution claim shall be reviewed by the judge
6 prior to acceptance of the plea agreement.

22 all cases regardless of whether the case is brought to trial. In a
23 plea bargain, the district attorney in every case where the victim
24 has suffered economic loss, shall, as a part of the plea bargain,
Req. No. 12662 Page 42

1 requ ire that the offender pay restitution to the crime victim. The
2 district attorney shall be authorized to act as a clearing house for
3 collection and disbursement of restitution payments made pursuant to
4 this section, and shall assess a fee of One Dollar ($1.00) per
5 payment received from the defendant, except when the defendant is
6 sentenced to incarceration in the Department of Corrections.
7 F. The crime victim shall provide all documentation and
8 evidence of compensation or reimbursement from insurance companies
9 or agencies of this state, any other state, or the federal
10 government received as a direct result of the crime for injury, loss
11 of earnings or out-of-pocket loss.
12 G. The court shall, upon motion by the crime victim, redact
13 from the submitted documentation all personal information relating
14 to the crime victim that does not directly and necessarily establish
15 the authenticity of any document or substantiate the asserted amount
16 of the restitution claim.
17 H. The unexcused failure or refusal of the crime victim to
18 provide all or part of the requisite information prior to the
19 sentencing, unless disclosure is deferred by the court, shall
20 constitute a waiver of any grounds to appeal or seek future
21 amendment or alteration of the restitution order predicated on the
22 undisclosed available information. The court shall order the
23 offender to submit either as part of the pre-sentence investigation
24 or assessment and evaluation required for a community sentence or,
Req. No. 12662 Page 43

1 if n o pre-sentence investigation is conducted, in advance of the
2 sentencing proceeding such information as the court may direct and
3 finds necessary to be disclosed for the purpose of ascertaining the
4 type and manner of restitution to be ordered.
5 I. The willful failure or refusal of the offender to provide
6 all or part of the requisite information prior to the sentencing,
7 unless disclosure is deferred by the court shall not deprive the
8 court of the authority to set restitution or set the schedule of
9 payment. The willful failure or refusal of the offender to provide
10 all or part of the requisite information prior to the sentencing,
11 unless disclosure is deferred by the court, shall constitute a
12 waiver of any grounds to appeal or seek future amendment or
13 alteration of the restitution order predicated on the undisclosed
14 information. The willful failure or refusal of the offender to
15 provide all or part of the requisite information prior to
16 sentencing, unless disclosure is deferred by the court, shall
17 constitute an act of contempt.
18 J. The court shall conduct such hearings or proceedings as it
19 deems necessary to set restitution and payment schedules at the time
20 of sentencing or may bifurcate the sentencing and defer the hearing
21 or proceedings relating to the imposition of restitution as justice
22 may require. Amendments or alterations to the restitution order may
23 be made upon the court's own motion, petition by the crime victim or
24 petition by the offender.
Req. No. 12662 Page 44

1 K. An offender who files a meritless or frivolous petition for
2 amendment or alteration to the restitution order shall pay the costs
3 of the proceeding on the petition and shall have added to the
4 existing restitution order the additional loss of earnings and out-
5 of-pocket loss incurred by the crime victim in responding to the
6 petition.
7 L. The restitution request form shall be promulgated by the
8 District Attorneys Council and provided to all district attorney
9 offices.
10 M. If a defendant who is financially able refuses or neglects
11 to pay restitution as ordered by this section, payment may be
12 enforced:
13 1. By contempt of court as provided in subsection A of Section
14 566 of Title 21 of the Oklahoma Statutes with imprisonment or fine
15 or both;
16 2. In the same manner as prescribed in subsection N of this
17 section for a defendant who is without means to make such
18 restitution payment; or
19 3. Revocation of the criminal sentence if the sentence imposed
20 was a suspended or deferred sentence or a community sentence.
21 N. If the defendant is without means to pay the restitution,
22 the judge may direct the total amount due, or any portion thereof,
23 to be entered upon the court minutes and to be certified in the
24 district court of the county where it shall then be entered upon the
Req. No. 12662 Page 45

1 dist rict court judgment docket and shall have the full force and
2 effect of a district court judgment in a civil case. Thereupon the
3 same remedies shall be available for the enforcement of the judgment
4 as are available to enforce other judgments; provided, however, the
5 judgment herein prescribed shall not be considered a debt nor
6 dischargeable in any bankruptcy proceeding.
7 O. Whenever a person has been ordered to pay restitution as
8 provided in this section or any section of the Oklahoma Statutes for
9 a criminal penalty, the judge may order the defendant to a term of
10 community service, with or without compensation, to be credited at a
11 rate of Five Dollars ($5.00) per day against the total amount due
12 for restitution. If the defendant fails to perform the required
13 community service authorized by this subsection or if the conditions
14 of community service are violated, the judge may impose a term of
15 imprisonment not to exceed five (5) days in the county jail for each
16 failure to comply.
17 P. Nothing in subsections M through O of this section shall be
18 construed to be additions to the original criminal penalty, but
19 shall be used by the court as sanctions and means of collection for
20 criminal restitution orders and restitution orders that have been
21 reduced to judgment.
22 SECTION 4. This act shall become effective November 1, 2025.
