17 case of a person convicted of a sex offense, supervision shall begin
18 immediately upon release from incarceration or if parole is granted
19 and shall not be limited to two (2) years. Provided further, any
20 supervision provided for in this section may be extended for a

6 SECTION 2. AMENDATORY 22 O.S. 2021, Section 991b, is
7 amended to read as follows:
8 Section 991b. A. Whenever a sentence has been suspended by the
9 court after conviction of a person for any crime, the suspended
10 sentence of the person may not be revoked, in whole or part, for any
11 cause unless a petition setting forth the grounds for such
12 revocation is filed by the district attorney with the clerk of the
13 sentencing court and competent evidence justifying the revocation of
14 the suspended sentence is presented to the court at a hearing to be
15 held for that purpose within twenty (20) days after the entry of the
16 plea of not guilty to the petition, unless waived by both the state
17 and the defendant. The State of Oklahoma may dismiss the petition
18 without prejudice one time upon good cause shown to the court,
19 provided that any successor petition must be filed within forty-five
20 (45) days of the date of the dismissal of the petition.
21 B. Whenever a sentence has been suspended by the court after
22 conviction of a person for any crime, the suspended sentence of the
23 person may not be revoked in whole for a technical violation unless
24 a petition setting forth the grounds for such revocation is filed by
HB1462 HFLR Page 32
BOLD FACE denotes Committee Amendments.

1 the district attorney with the clerk of the sentencing court and
2 competent evidence justifying the revocation of the suspended
3 sentence is presented to the court at a hearing to be held for that
4 purpose within twenty (20) days after the entry of the plea of not
5 guilty to the petition, unless waived by both the state and the
6 defendant. The State of Oklahoma may dismiss the petition without
7 prejudice one time upon good cause shown to the court; provided,
8 that any successor petition must be filed within forty-five (45)
9 days of the date of the dismissal of the petition. Any revocation
10 of a suspended sentence based on a technical violation shall not
11 exceed six (6) months for a first revocation and five (5) years for
12 a second or subsequent revocation.
13 C. "Technical violation" as used in this section means a
14 violation of the court-imposed rules and conditions of probation,
15 other than:
16 1. Committing or being arrested for a new crime;
17 2. Attempting to falsify a drug screen, or three or more failed
18 drug or alcohol screens within a three-month period;
19 3. Failing to pay restitution;

3 8. Any violation of the Specialized Sex Offender Rules.
4 D. 1. The Department of Corrections shall develop a matrix of
5 technical violations and sanctions to address violations committed
6 by persons who are being supervised by the Department. The
7 Department shall be authorized to use a violation response and
8 intermediate sanction process based on the sanction matrix to apply
9 to any technical violations of probationers. Within four (4)
10 working days of the discovery of the violation, the probation
11 officer shall initiate the violation response and intermediate
12 sanction process. The sentencing judge may authorize any
13 recommended sanctions, which may include, but are not limited to:
14 short-term jail or lockup, day treatment, program attendance,
15 community service, outpatient or inpatient treatment, monetary
16 fines, curfews, ignition interlock devices on vehicles, or a one-
17 time referral to a term of confinement of six (6) months in an
18 intermediate revocation facility operated by the Department of
19 Corrections; provided, upon approval of the district attorney, a
20 person may be sanctioned to serve additional terms of confinement in
21 an intermediate revocation facility. The probation officer shall
22 complete a sanction form, which shall specify the technical
23 violation, sanction, and the action plan to correct the noncompliant
24 behavior resulting in the technical violation. The probation
HB1462 HFLR Page 34
BOLD FACE denotes Committee Amendments.

1 offi cer shall refer to the sanctioning matrix to determine the
2 supervision, treatment, and sanctions appropriate to address the
3 noncompliant behavior. The probation officer shall refer the
4 violation information and recommended response with a sanction plan
5 to the Department of Corrections to be heard by a hearing officer.
6 The Department of Corrections shall develop a sanction matrix,
7 forms, policies and procedures necessary to implement this
8 provision. The Department of Corrections shall establish procedures
9 to hear responses to technical violations and review sanction plans
10 including the following:
11 a. hearing officers shall report through a chain of
12 command separate from that of the supervising
13 probation officers,
14 b. the Department shall provide the offender written
15 notice of the violation, the evidence relied upon, and
16 the reason the sanction was imposed,
17 c. the hearing shall be held unless the offender waives
18 the right to the hearing,
19 d. hearings shall be electronically recorded, and
20 e. the Department shall provide to judges and district
21 attorneys a record of all violations and actions taken
22 pursuant to this subsection.
23 2. The hearing officer shall determine based on a preponderance
24 of the evidence whether a technical violation occurred. Upon a
HB1462 HFLR Page 35
BOLD FACE denotes Committee Amendments.

1 find ing that a technical violation occurred, the hearing officer may
2 order the offender to participate in the recommended sanction plan
3 or may modify the plan. Offenders who accept the sanction plan
4 shall sign a violation response sanction form, and the hearing
5 officer shall then impose the sanction. Failure of the offender to
6 comply with the imposed sanction plan shall constitute a violation
7 of the rules and conditions of supervision that may result in a
8 revocation proceeding. If an offender does not voluntarily accept
9 the recommended sanction plan, the Department shall either impose
10 the sanction and allow the offender to appeal to the district court,
11 or request a revocation proceeding as provided by law. Every
12 administrative hearing and sanction imposed by the Department shall
13 be appealable to the district court.
14 3. Absent a finding of willful nonpayment by the offender, the
15 failure of an offender to pay fines and costs may not serve as a
16 basis for revocation, excluding restitution.
17 E. 1. Where one of the grounds for revocation is the failure
18 of the defendant to make restitution as ordered, the Department of
19 Corrections shall forward to the district attorney all information
20 pertaining to the failure of the defendant to make timely
21 restitution as ordered by the court, and the district attorney shall
22 file a petition setting forth the grounds for revocation.
23 2. The defendant ordered to make restitution can petition the
24 court at any time for remission or a change in the terms of the
HB1462 HFLR Page 36
BOLD FACE denotes Committee Amendments.

1 orde r of restitution if the defendant undergoes a change of
2 condition which materially affects the ability of the defendant to
3 comply with the order of the court.
4 3. At the hearing, if one of the grounds for the petition for
5 revocation is the failure of the defendant to make timely
6 restitution as ordered by the court, the court will hear evidence
7 and if it appears to the satisfaction of the court from such
8 evidence that the terms of the order of restitution create a
9 manifest hardship on the defendant or the immediate family of the
10 defendant, the court may cancel all or any part of the amount still
11 due, or modify the terms or method of payment; provided, however,
12 the court shall continue to prioritize an order for payments of
13 restitution to the victim. Provided, if the court determines that a
14 reduction in the restitution still due is warranted, the court shall
15 equally apply the same percentage reduction to any court-ordered
16 monetary obligation owed by the defendant including, but not limited
17 to, fines, court costs and costs of incarceration.
18 F. The court may revoke a portion of the sentence and leave the
19 remaining part not revoked, but suspended for the remainder of the
20 term of the sentence, and under the provisions applying to it. The
21 person whose suspended sentence is being considered for revocation
22 at the hearing shall have the right to be represented by counsel, to
23 present competent evidence in his or her own behalf and to be
24 confronted by the witnesses against the defendant. Any order of the
HB1462 HFLR Page 37
BOLD FACE denotes Committee Amendments.

1 cour t revoking the suspended sentence, in whole or in part, shall be
2 subject to review on appeal, as in other appeals of criminal cases.
3 Provided, however, that if the crime for which the suspended
4 sentence is given was a felony, the defendant may be allowed bail
5 pending appeal. If the reason for revocation be that the defendant
6 committed a felony, the defendant shall not be allowed bail pending
7 appeal.
8 G. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections A and B of
9 this section, when the suspended sentence of a person is being
10 considered for revocation for an offense where the penalty has
11 subsequently been lowered to a misdemeanor, the sentence shall be
12 modified to a term that does not exceed the current maximum
13 sentence.
14 SECTION 3. AMENDATORY 22 O.S. 2021, Section 991f, is
15 amended to read as follows:
16 Section 991f. A. For the purposes of any provision of Title 22

6 to or loss of real and personal property and any other out-of-pocket
7 expenses, including loss of earnings, reasonably incurred as the

9 elements of damage shall be included as an economic loss for
10 purposes of this section.
11 B. In all criminal prosecutions and juvenile proceedings in
12 this state, when the court shall prioritize an order for payments of
13 restitution to the victim. When the court enters an order directing
14 the offender to pay restitution to any victim for economic loss or
15 to pay to the state any fines, fees or assessments, the order, for
16 purposes of validity and collection, shall not be limited to the
17 maximum term of imprisonment for which the offender could have been
18 sentenced, nor limited to any term of probation, parole, or
19 extension thereof, nor expire until fully satisfied. The court
20 order for restitution, fines, fees or assessments shall remain a
21 continuing obligation of the offender until fully satisfied, and the
22 obligation shall not be considered a debt, nor shall the obligation
23 be dischargeable in any bankruptcy proceeding. The court order

7 substantially decreased as a direct result of the crime, or wherein
8 the crime victim suffered injury, loss of income, or out-of-pocket
9 loss, the individuals criminally responsible shall be sentenced to
10 make restitution. Restitution may be ordered in addition to the
11 punishments prescribed by law.
12 2. The court shall order full restitution based upon the
13 following considerations:
14 a. the nature and amount of restitution shall be
15 sufficient to restore the crime victim to the
16 equivalent economic status existing prior to the
17 losses sustained as a direct result of the crime, and
18 may allow the crime victim to receive payment in
19 excess of the losses sustained; provided, the excess
20 amount of restitution shall not be more than treble
21 the actual economic loss incurred, and
22 b. the amount of restitution shall be established
23 regardless of the financial resources of the offender.
24 3. The court:
HB1462 HFLR Page 40
BOLD FACE denotes Committee Amendments.

1 a. may direct the return of property to be made as soon
2 as practicable and make an award of restitution in the
3 amount of the loss of value to the property itself as
4 a direct result of the crime, including out-of-pocket
5 expenses and loss of earnings incurred as a result of
6 damage to or loss of use of the property, the cost to
7 return the property to the victim or to restore the
8 property to its pre-crime condition whichever may be

11 schedules as may be established and thereafter

20 accrue at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum
21 until the restitution is paid in full. The court may
22 further order such interest to be paid to the victims
23 of the crime or proportion the interest payment

3 e. shall consider any pre-existing orders imposed on the
4 defendant, including, but not limited to, orders
5 imposed under civil and criminal proceedings.
6 D. If restitution to more than one person, agency or entity is
7 set at the same time, the court shall establish the following
8 priorities of payment:

11 to the victim as a result of the offender's criminal conduct.
12 E. 1. The district attorney's office shall present the crime
13 victim's restitution claim to the court at the time of the
