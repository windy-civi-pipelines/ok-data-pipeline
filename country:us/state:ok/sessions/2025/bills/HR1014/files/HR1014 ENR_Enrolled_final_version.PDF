RESOLUTION NO. 1014 By: Sneed
A Resolution commending the benefits and
contributions of purebred dogs and recognizing April
8th, 2025, as Purebred Dog Day in the State of
Oklahoma; directing distribution of copies of the
resolution.
WHEREAS, dedicated individuals in Oklahoma breed dogs to develop
unique predictable characteristics that enable dogs to excel in a
wide range of beneficial areas; and
WHEREAS, purebred dogs are living legacies of the cultures that
created them, and historically, these dogs worked alongside their
people and provided them companionship; and
WHEREAS, the service of these breeds continues as they work
alongside humans and provide inestimable companionship as guide
dogs, service dogs, conservation dogs, livestock guardians, search
and rescue dogs, earth dogs, police dogs, canine soldiers serving by
the sides of our military men and women, and guardians of family,
home, and hearth; and
WHEREAS, purebred dogs have been of enormous help to medical
science, serving as models for many heritable human diseases,
playing a role in humanity's understanding of the human and canine
genomes, and benefitting pharmaceutical research and development;
and
WHEREAS, purebred dogs are working dogs, serving as avalanche
dogs, trackers and trailers, herders, controllers of vermin, water
rescuers, carting and sled dogs, retrievers, protectors, hunters,
and bird dogs; and
WHEREAS, all dogs should be valued whatever their ancestry, but
the purpose-bred dog and the predictability of its breed should be
cherished and preserved; and

WHEREAS, each breed is incredibly etched in the history of the
culture that created it, just as surely as that culture's music,
art, and language, making it abundantly fitting that we recognize
purebred dogs.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
OF THE 1ST SESSION OF THE 60TH OKLAHOMA LEGISLATURE:
THAT the House of Representatives commend the benefits and
contributions of purebred dogs and recognizes April 8th, 2025, as
Purebred Dog Day in the State of Oklahoma.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Speaker of the House is
authorized and directed to make appropriate copies of this
resolution available for distribution to the public and the press.
