amended to read as follows:
14
15
Section 1203. (a) A. The Department shall have authority to
15
16
acquire in fee simple in the name of the State of Oklahoma, by
16
17
purchase, donation or condemnation, lands or such interests therein
17
18
as in its discretion may be necessary for the purpose of
18
19
establishing, constructing, and maintaining state highways or
19
20
relocations thereof, and facilities necessary or incident thereto,
20
21
including borrow areas, channel changes, and deposits of rock,
21
22
gravel, sand and other road building material for use in highway
22
23
construction and maintenance. Such acquisition may be for immediate

24
Req. No. 510 Page 1

1
land adjacent to its normal right-of-way for the purpose of
1
2
screening unsightly areas adjacent to highways, landscaping safety,
2
3
rest areas, and scenic overlook areas.
3
4
(b) B. In determining the amount of land required, or width of
4
5
right-of-way necessary for such state highways, the Department shall
5
6
take into consideration the present and probable future needs in
6
7
connection with maintaining and reconstructing the highways, and the
7
8
prevention of traffic congestion and hazards.
8
9
(c) C. Except in instances where there are nonresident owners,
9
10
unknown heirs, imperfect titles, and owners whose whereabouts cannot
10
11
be ascertained with reasonable diligence, the Department shall give
11
12
the owner an opportunity to sell the necessary lands or interests
12
13
therein to the State of Oklahoma before resort to condemnation may
13
14
be had. The Department may condemn such lands or interests therein
14
15
in the following manner:
15
16
The district judge of the county in which the real property may
16
17
be situated, upon petition of either party, and after ten (10) days’
17
18
notice to the opposite party, either by personal service or by
18
19
leaving a copy thereof at his usual place of residence with some
19
20
member of his family over fifteen (15) years of age, or, in the case
20
21
of nonresidents, unknown heirs or other persons whose whereabouts
21
22
cannot be ascertained, by publication in two issues of a newspaper
22
23
in general circulation in the county (the ten-day period to begin
23
24
with the first publication), shall direct the sheriff of the county
24
Req. No. 510 Page 2

1
to summon three disinterested freeholders, to be selected by the
1
2
judge as commissioners, and who shall not be interested in a like
2
3
question. The commissioners shall be sworn to perform their duties
3
4
impartially and justly; and they shall inspect the real property and
4
5
consider the injury which the owner may sustain by reason of the
5
6
condemnation, and they shall assess the just compensation to which
6
7
the owner is entitled; and they shall forthwith make a report in
7
8
writing to the clerk of the court, setting forth the quantity,
8
9
boundaries and just compensation for the property taken, and amount
9
10
of injury done to the property, either directly or indirectly, which
10
11
they assess to the owner, which report must be filed and recorded by
11
12
the clerk. A certified copy of the report may be transmitted to the
12
13
county clerk of the county where the land lies, to be filed and
13
14
recorded by the county clerk (without further acknowledgment or
14
15
proof) in the same manner and with like force and effect as is
15
16
provided for the recording of deeds. The procedure for service by
16
17
publication as authorized herein shall be the same as provided by
17
18
law for service by publication in civil actions, except summons need
18
19
not be issued and served, and except as otherwise provided herein.
19
20
(d) D. Immediately upon payment to the clerk of the court for
20
21
the use of the owner the sum so assessed and reported to the court
21
22
clerk as aforesaid, the Department shall thereby be authorized to
22
23
enter upon the condemned premises, and remove and dispose of any
23
24
obstructions thereon, by sale or otherwise. If the landowner shall
24
Req. No. 510 Page 3

1
refuse to deliver up possession to the Department, the court shall
1
2
issue an order to the sheriff of the county to place the Department
2
3
in possession thereof.
3
4
(e) E. (1) 1. The report of commissioners may be reviewed by
4
5
the district court, on written exceptions filed by either party in
5
6
the clerk’s office within thirty (30) days after the filing of such
6
7
report, and the court, after hearing had, shall make such order
7
8
therein as right and justice may require, either by confirmation,
8
9
rejection or by ordering a new appraisement on good cause shown.
9
10
Provided, that in the event a new appraisement is ordered, the
10
11
Department shall have the continuing right of possession obtained
11
12
under the first appraisal, unless and until its right to condemn has
12
13
finally been determined otherwise; or either party may within sixty
13
14
(60) days after the filing of such report file with the clerk a
14
15
written demand for a trial by jury, in which case the amount of
15
16
damages shall be assessed by a jury, and the trial shall be
16
17
conducted and judgment entered in the same manner as civil actions
17
18
in the district court. If the party demanding such trial does not
18
19
recover a verdict more favorable to the party than the assessment of
19
20
the commissioners, all costs in the district court shall be taxed
20
21
against the party. No owner upon whom proper service by publication
21
22
has been had, as provided in this title, shall be let in to defend
22
23
after expiration of time for appeal or review of the report of
23
24
commissioners as above provided has elapsed. Provided, that if,
24
Req. No. 510 Page 4

1
after the filing of exceptions to the report of commissioners as
1
2
hereinafter provided, the Department shall fail to establish its
2
3
right to condemn such premises, or any part thereof, the landowner
3
4
shall be restored to possession of the premises, or part thereof,
4
5
and the Department shall pay for any damages sustained through the
5
6
occupation by the Department, and if such damages cannot be
6
7
determined by amicable settlement they shall be determined by jury
7
8
trial in the same proceedings.
8
9
(2) 2. Within ten (10) days after the Report of Commissioners
9
10
is filed, the court clerk shall forward to the attorney of record
10
11
for the condemnor, the attorney of record for each condemnee, and to
11
12
all unrepresented condemnees, a copy of the commissioners’ report
12
13
and a notice, stating the time limits for filing an exception or
13
14
demand for jury trial as specified in paragraph (A) of Section 55 of
14
15
Title 66 of the Oklahoma Statutes. The attorney of record for the
15
16
condemnor shall provide the clerk of the court with the names and
16
17
last-known addresses of the parties to whom notice and the report of
17
18
the commissioners shall be mailed, sufficient copies of the notice
18
19
and report to be mailed, and pre-addressed, postage-paid envelopes.
19
20
This notice shall be on a form prepared by the Court Administrator,
20
21
which shall be approved by the Supreme Court, and shall be
21
22
distributed to all clerks of the district court by the Court
22
23
Administrator. If a party has been served by publication, the clerk
23
24
shall forward a copy of the report of commissioners and notice of
24
Req. No. 510 Page 5

1
time limits for filing an exception or demand for jury trial to the
1
2
last-known mailing address, if any, and shall cause a copy of the
2
3
notice of time limits to be published in one issue of a newspaper
3
4
qualified to publish legal notices, as defined in Section 106 of
4
5
Title 25 of the Oklahoma Statutes. After issuing the notices
5
6
provided herein the court clerk shall endorse on the notice form
6
7
filed in the case the date and that a copy of the report together
7
8
with the notice form filed in the case was forwarded to each
8
9
condemnee and each attorney of record, or the date the notice was
9
10
published in compliance with the provisions hereof.
10
11
(3) 3. The time limits for filing an exception and demand for
11
12
jury trial, as prescribed in paragraph (A) of Section 55 of Title 66
12
13
of the Oklahoma Statutes, shall be calculated from the date the
13
14
report of the commissioners is filed in the case. On failure of the
14
15
court clerk to give notice within the time prescribed in paragraph
15
16
(B) of Section 55 of Title 66 of the Oklahoma Statutes, the court,
16
17
on application of any party, may extend the time for filing an
17
18
exception to the report, or a demand for trial by jury for a period
18
19
not to exceed twenty (20) days from the date the application is
19
20
heard.
20
21
(f) F. Either party aggrieved may appeal to the Supreme Court
21
22
from the decision of the district court on exceptions to the report
22
23
of commissioners, or jury trial; but such review or appeal shall not
23
24
delay the prosecution of the work on such highway over the premises
24
Req. No. 510 Page 6

1
in question if the award of commissioners, or jury, as the case may
1
2
be, has been deposited with the clerk for such owner, and in no case
2
3
shall the Department be liable for the costs on such review or
3
4
appeal unless the owner of the real property shall be adjudged
4
5
entitled, upon either review or appeal, to a greater amount of
5
6
damages than was awarded by the commissioners. The Department shall
6
7
in all cases pay the cost of the commissioners’ fees and expenses,
7
8
for their services, as determined and ordered paid by the judge of
8
9
the district court in which such case is pending, however, poundage
9
10
fees and condemnation fees shall only be paid by the Department in
10
11
the event of appeal resulting in a jury verdict in excess of the
11
12
commissioners’ award, but under no circumstances shall any poundage
12
13
fees or condemnation fees be assessed against the recipient of the
13
14
award. And in case of review or appeal, a certified copy of the
14
15
final order or judgment shall be transmitted by the clerk of the
15
16
court, duly certified, to the proper county clerk, to be filed and
16
17
recorded as hereinabove provided for the recording of the report,
17
18
and with like effect.
18
19
(g) G. When an estate is being probated, or a minor or
19
20
incompetent person has a legal guardian, the administrator or
20
21
executor of the estate, or guardian of the minor or incompetent
21
22
person, shall have the authority to execute all instruments of
22
23
conveyance provided for in this title on behalf of the estate, minor
23
24
or incompetent person without other proceedings than approval by the
24
Req. No. 510 Page 7

1
judge of the district court endorsed on the instrument of
1
2
conveyance.
2
3
(h) H. “Just compensation”, as used in this section, shall mean
3
4
the value of the property taken, and in addition, any injury to any
4
5
part of the property not taken. Any special and direct benefits to
5
6
the part of the property not taken may be offset only against any
6
7
injury to the property not taken. If only a part of a tract is
7
8
taken, just compensation shall be ascertained by determining the
8
9
difference between the fair market value of the whole tract
9
10
immediately before the taking and the fair market value of that
10
11
portion left remaining immediately after the taking.
11
12
(i) I. 1. In the event that the determination of just
12
13
compensation of a property is less than the commissioners’ award for
13
14
such real property, any mortgagee or lien holder who received
14
15
payment from the commissioners’ award in an amount in excess of the
15
16
finding of just compensation value of the real property taken will
16
17
only be liable for and required to pay back to the condemnor no more
17
18
than the difference between what was actually received by the
18
19
mortgagee or lien holder from the commissioners’ award and the
19
20
jury’s just compensation value.
20
21
2. In all respects a mortgagee or lien holder will only be
21
22
liable to return to the condemnor any sums actually paid to and
22
23
received by such party in excess of the determination of just
23
24
compensation for the real property. The mortgagor would be and
24
Req. No. 510 Page 8

1
remain liable to the mortgagee or lien holder for the excess that is
1
2
paid by the mortgagee or lienholder to the condemning authority.
2
3
3. The mortgagee or lien holder shall only be liable for and
3
4
required to pay back to the condemnor the monies required in
4
5
paragraph 1 of this subsection if such determination of just
5
6
compensation is made within one (1) year of the mortgagee or lien
6
7
holder receiving payment from the commissioners’ award.
7
8
SECTION 2. This act shall become effective July 1, 2025.
8
9
SECTION 3. It being immediately necessary for the preservation
9
10
of the public peace, health or safety, an emergency is hereby
10
11
declared to exist, by reason whereof this act shall take effect and
11
12
be in full force from and after its passage and approval.
