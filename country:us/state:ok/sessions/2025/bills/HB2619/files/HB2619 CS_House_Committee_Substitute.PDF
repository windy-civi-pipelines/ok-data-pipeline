24 DISCLOSURES.
Req. No. 13123 Page 1

1 1. DISCOVERY METHODS. Parties may obtain discovery regarding
2 any matter that is relevant to any party's claim or defense by one
3 or more of the following methods: Depositions upon oral examination
4 or written questions; written interrogatories; production of
5 documents or things or permission to enter upon land or other
6 property, for inspection and other purposes; physical and mental
7 examinations; requests for admission; authorizations for release of
8 records; and otherwise by court order upon showing of good cause.
9 Except as provided in this section or unless the court orders
10 otherwise under this section, the frequency of use of these methods
11 is not limited.
12 2. INITIAL DISCLOSURES.
13 a. Except in categories of proceedings specified in
14 subparagraph b of this paragraph, or to the extent
15 otherwise stipulated or directed by order, a party,
16 without awaiting a discovery request, shall provide to
17 other parties a computation of any category of damages
18 claimed by the disclosing party, making available for
19 inspection and copying the documents or other
20 evidentiary material, not privileged or protected from
21 disclosure, on which such computation is based,
22 including materials bearing on the nature and extent
23 of injuries suffered. Subject to subsection B of this
24 section, in any action in which physical or mental
Req. No. 13123 Page 2

1 injury is claimed, the party making the claim shall
2 provide to the other parties a release or
3 authorization allowing the parties to obtain relevant
4 medical records and bills, and, when relevant, a
5 release or authorization for employment and scholastic
6 records.
7 b. The following categories of proceedings are exempt
8 from initial disclosure under subparagraph a of this
9 paragraph:
10 (1) an action for review of an administrative record,
11 (2) a petition for habeas corpus or other proceeding
12 to challenge a criminal conviction or sentence,
13 (3) an action brought without counsel by a person in
14 custody of the United States, a state, or a state
15 subdivision,
16 (4) an action to enforce or quash an administrative
17 summons or subpoena,
18 (5) an action by the United States to recover benefit
19 payments,
20 (6) an action by the United States to collect on a
21 student loan guaranteed by the United States,
22 (7) a proceeding ancillary to proceedings in other
23 courts, and
24 (8) an action to enforce an arbitration award.
Req. No. 13123 Page 3

1 c. Disclosures required under this paragraph shall be
2 made at or within sixty (60) days after service unless
3 a different time is set by stipulation or court order,
4 or unless a party objects that initial disclosures are
5 not appropriate in the circumstances of the action and
6 states the objection in a motion filed with the court.
7 In ruling on the objection, the court shall determine
8 what disclosures, if any, are to be made and set the
9 time for disclosure. A party shall make its initial
10 disclosures based on the information then readily
11 available to it and is not excused from making its
12 disclosures because it has not fully completed its
13 investigation of the case or because it challenges the
14 sufficiency of another party's disclosures or because
15 another party has not made its disclosures.
16 B. DISCOVERY SCOPE AND LIMITS. Unless otherwise limited by
17 order of the court in accordance with the Oklahoma Discovery Code,
18 the scope of discovery is as follows:
19 1. IN GENERAL.
20 a. Parties may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not
21 privileged, which is relevant to any party's claim or
22 defense, reasonably calculated to lead to the
23 discovery of admissible evidence and proportional to
24 the needs of the case, considering the importance of
Req. No. 13123 Page 4

1 the issues at stake in the action, the amount in
2 controversy, the parties' relative access to relevant
3 information, the parties' resources, the importance of
4 the discovery in resolving the issues, and whether the
5 burden or expense of the proposed discovery outweighs
6 its likely benefit. Information within this scope of
7 discovery need not be admissible in evidence to be
8 discoverable.
9 b. A party shall produce upon request pursuant to Section
10 3234 of this title, any insurance agreement under
11 which any person carrying on an insurance business may
12 be liable to satisfy part or all of a judgment which
13 may be entered in the action or to indemnify or
14 reimburse for payments made to satisfy the judgment.
15 Information concerning the insurance agreement is not
16 by reason of disclosure admissible in evidence at
17 trial. For purposes of this section, an application
18 for insurance shall not be treated as a part of an
19 insurance agreement.
20 c. A party shall produce upon request, pursuant to
21 Section 3234 of this title, any commercial litigation
22 funding agreement as defined in Section 3 of this act.
23 Information related to the commercial litigation
24 funding agreement is not, by reason of disclosure,
Req. No. 13123 Page 5

1 admissible as evidence at trial. Production of a
2 commercial litigation funding agreement shall include
3 a certification, by sworn affidavit, by the producing
4 party as to whether any funds encumbered by the terms
5 of the agreement have been or will be sourced from a
6 foreign state or agency or instrumentality of a
7 foreign state as defined in 28 U.S.C., Section 1603 or
8 22 U.S.C., Section 611, as amended. Certification
9 that discloses that a foreign state or agency or
10 instrumentality of a foreign state is such a source
11 shall include the identity of the foreign state,
12 agency, or instrumentality that is the source of the
13 funds. Such certification shall be supplemented or
14 corrected by the producing party within thirty (30)
15 days in the event the certification becomes incomplete
16 or inaccurate in a material aspect. A consumer
17 litigation funding agreement as defined in Section 3-
18 801 of Title 14A of the Oklahoma Statutes shall be
19 exempt from the provisions of this subparagraph.
20 2. LIMITATIONS ON FREQUENCY AND EXTENT.
21 a. By order, the court may alter the limits on the length
22 of depositions under Section 3230 of this title, on
23 the number of interrogatories under Section 3233 of
24 this title, on the number of requests to produce under
Req. No. 13123 Page 6

1 Section 3234 of this title, or on the number of
2 requests for admission under Section 3236 of this
3 title.
4 b. A party is not required to provide discovery of
5 electronically stored information from sources that
6 the party identifies as not reasonably accessible
7 because of undue burden or cost. On motion to compel
8 discovery or for a protective order, the party from
9 whom discovery is sought must show that the
10 information is not reasonably accessible because of
11 undue burden or cost. If that showing is made, the
12 court may order discovery from such sources if the
13 requesting party shows good cause, considering the
14 limitations of subparagraph c of this paragraph. The
15 court may specify conditions for the discovery.
16 c. On motion or on its own, the court shall limit the
17 frequency or extent of discovery otherwise allowed if
18 it determines that:
19 (1) the discovery sought is unreasonably cumulative
20 or duplicative, or can be obtained from some
21 other source that is more convenient, less
22 burdensome, or less expensive,
23
24
Req. No. 13123 Page 7

1 (2) the party seeking discovery has had ample
2 opportunity to obtain the information by
3 discovery in the action, or
4 (3) the proposed discovery is outside the scope
5 permitted by subparagraph a of paragraph 1 of
6 this subsection.
7 d. If an officer, director or managing agent of a
8 corporation or a government official is served with
9 notice of a deposition or subpoena regarding a matter
10 about which he or she has no knowledge, he or she may
11 submit at a reasonable time prior to the date of the
12 deposition an affidavit to the noticing party so
13 stating and identifying a person within the
14 corporation or government entity who has knowledge of
15 the subject matter involved in the pending action.
16 Notwithstanding such affidavit, the noticing party may
17 proceed with the deposition, subject to the noticed
18 witness's right to seek a protective order.
19 3. TRIAL PREPARATION: MATERIALS.
20 a. Unless as provided by paragraph 4 of this subsection,
21 a party may not discover documents and tangible things
22 that are prepared in anticipation of litigation or for
23 trial by or for another party or its representative,
24 including the other party's attorney, consultant,
Req. No. 13123 Page 8

1 surety, indemnitor, insurer or agent. Subject to
2 paragraph 4 of this subsection, such materials may be
3 discovered if:
4 (1) they are otherwise discoverable under paragraph 1
5 of this subsection, and
6 (2) the party shows that it has substantial need for
7 the materials to prepare its case and cannot,
8 without undue hardship, obtain their substantial
9 equivalent by other means.
10 b. If the court orders discovery of such materials, the
11 court shall protect against disclosure of the mental
12 impressions, conclusions, opinions or legal theories
13 of a party's attorney or other representative
14 concerning the litigation.
15 c. A party or other person may, upon request and without
16 the required showing, obtain the person's own previous
17 statement about the action or its subject matter. If
18 the request is refused, the person may move for a
19 court order, and the provisions of paragraph 4 of
20 subsection A of Section 3237 of this title apply to
21 the award of expenses. A previous statement is
22 either:
23 (1) a written statement that the person has signed or
24 otherwise adopted or approved, or
Req. No. 13123 Page 9

1 (2) a contemporaneous stenographic, mechanical,
2 electrical, or other recording, or a
3 transcription thereof, which recites
4 substantially verbatim the person's oral
5 statement.
6 4. TRIAL PREPARATION: EXPERTS.
7 a. Discovery of facts known and opinions held by experts,
8 otherwise discoverable under the provisions of
9 paragraph 1 of this subsection and acquired or
10 developed in anticipation of litigation or for trial,
11 may be obtained only as follows:
12 (1) a party may, through interrogatories, require any
13 other party to identify each person whom that
14 other party expects to call as an expert witness
15 at trial and give the address at which that
16 expert witness may be located,
17 (2) after disclosure of the names and addresses of
18 the expert witnesses, the other party expects to
19 call as witnesses, the party, who has requested
20 disclosure, may depose any such expert witnesses
21 subject to scope of this section. Prior to
22 taking the deposition the party must give notice
23 as required in subsections A and C of Section
24 3230 of this title, and
Req. No. 13123 Page 10

1 (3) in addition to taking the depositions of expert
2 witnesses the party may, through interrogatories,
3 require the party who expects to call the expert
4 witnesses to state the subject matter on which
5 each expert witness is expected to testify; the
6 substance of the facts and opinions to which the
7 expert is expected to testify and a summary of
8 the grounds for each opinion; the qualifications
9 of each expert witness, including a list of all
10 publications authored by the expert witness
11 within the preceding ten (10) years; the
12 compensation to be paid to the expert witness for
13 the testimony and preparation for the testimony;
14 and a listing of any other cases in which the
15 expert witness has testified as an expert at
16 trial or by deposition within the preceding four
17 (4) years. An interrogatory seeking the
18 information specified above shall be treated as a
19 single interrogatory for purposes of the
20 limitation on the number of interrogatories in
21 Section 3233 of this title.
22 b. The protection provided by paragraph 3 of this
23 subsection extends to communications between the
24 party's attorney and any expert witness retained or
Req. No. 13123 Page 11

1 specially employed to provide expert testimony in the
2 case or whose duties as the party's employee regularly
3 involve giving expert testimony, except to the extent
4 that the communications:
5 (1) relate to compensation for the expert's study or
6 testimony,
7 (2) identify facts or data that the party's attorney
8 provided and that the expert considered in
9 forming the opinions to be expressed, or
10 (3) identify assumptions that the party's attorney
11 provided and that the expert relied upon in
12 forming the opinions to be expressed.
13 c. A party may not, by interrogatories or deposition,
14 discover facts known or opinions held by an expert who
15 has been retained or specially employed by another
16 party in anticipation of litigation or to prepare for
17 trial and who is not expected to be called as a
18 witness at trial, except as provided in Section 3235
19 of this title or upon a showing of exceptional
20 circumstances under which it is impracticable for the
21 party to obtain facts or opinions on the same subject
22 by other means.
23 d. Unless manifest injustice would result:
24
Req. No. 13123 Page 12

1 (1) the court shall require that the party seeking
2 discovery pay the expert a reasonable fee for
3 time spent in responding to discovery under
4 division (2) of subparagraph a of this paragraph
5 and subparagraph c of this paragraph, and
6 (2) the court shall require that the party seeking
7 discovery with respect to discovery obtained
8 under subparagraph c of this paragraph, pay the
9 other party a fair portion of the fees and
10 expenses reasonably incurred by the latter party
11 in obtaining facts and opinions from the expert.
12 5. CLAIMS OF PRIVILEGE OR PROTECTION OF TRIAL PREPARATION
13 MATERIALS.
14 a. When a party withholds information otherwise
15 discoverable under the Oklahoma Discovery Code by
16 claiming that it is privileged or subject to
17 protection as trial preparation material, the party
18 shall make the claim expressly and shall describe the
19 nature of the documents, communications, or things not
20 produced or disclosed in a manner that, without
21 revealing information itself privileged or protected,
22 will enable other parties to assess the applicability
23 of the privilege or protection.
24
Req. No. 13123 Page 13

1 b. If information produced in discovery is subject to a
2 claim of privilege or of protection as trial
3 preparation material, the party making the claim may
4 notify any party that received the information of the
5 claim and the basis for it. After being notified, a
6 party shall promptly return, sequester, or destroy the
7 specified information and any copies the party has;
8 shall not use or disclose the information until the
9 claim is resolved; shall take reasonable steps to
10 retrieve the information if the party has disclosed it
11 before being notified; and may promptly present the
12 information to the court under seal for a
13 determination of the claim. The producing party shall
14 preserve the information until the claim is resolved.
15 This mechanism is procedural only and does not alter
16 the standards governing whether the information is
17 privileged or subject to protection as trial
18 preparation material or whether such privilege or
19 protection has been waived.
20 C. PROTECTIVE ORDERS.
21 1. Upon motion by a party or by the person from whom discovery
22 is sought, accompanied by a certification that the movant has in
23 good faith conferred or attempted to confer, either in person or by
24 telephone, with other affected parties in an effort to resolve the
Req. No. 13123 Page 14

1 disp ute without court action, and for good cause shown, the court in
2 which the action is pending or on matters relating to a deposition,
3 the district court in the county where the deposition is to be taken
4 may enter any order which justice requires to protect a party or
5 person from annoyance, harassment, embarrassment, oppression or
6 undue delay, burden or expense, including one or more of the
7 following:
8 a. that the discovery not be had,
9 b. that the discovery may be had only on specified terms
10 and conditions, including a designation of the time,
11 place or the allocation of expenses,
12 c. that the discovery may be had only by a method of
13 discovery other than that selected by the party
14 seeking discovery,
15 d. that certain matters not be inquired into, or that the
16 scope of the disclosure or discovery be limited to
17 certain matters,
18 e. that discovery be conducted with no one present except
19 persons designated by the court,
20 f. that a deposition after being sealed be opened only by
21 order of the court,
22 g. that a trade secret or other confidential research,
23 development or commercial information not be disclosed
24 or be disclosed only in a designated way, and
Req. No. 13123 Page 15

1 h. that the parties simultaneously file specified
2 documents or information enclosed in sealed envelopes
3 to be opened as directed by the court.
4 2. If the motion for a protective order is denied in whole or
5 in part, the court may, on such terms and conditions as are just,
6 order that any party or person provide or permit discovery. The
7 provisions of paragraph 4 of subsection A of Section 3237 of this
8 title apply to the award of expenses incurred in relation to the
9 motion. Any protective order of the court which has the effect of
10 removing any material obtained by discovery from the public record
11 shall contain the following:
12 a. a statement that the court has determined it is
13 necessary in the interests of justice to remove the
14 material from the public record,
15 b. specific identification of the material which is to be
16 removed or withdrawn from the public record, or which
17 is to be filed but not placed in the public record,
18 and
19 c. a requirement that any party obtaining a protective
20 order place the protected material in a sealed manila
21 envelope clearly marked with the caption and case
22 number and is clearly marked with the word
23 "CONFIDENTIAL", and stating the date the order was
24 entered and the name of the judge entering the order.
Req. No. 13123 Page 16

1 This requirement may also be satisfied by requiring
2 the party to file the documents pursuant to the
3 procedure for electronically filing sealed or
4 confidential documents approved for electronic filing
5 in the courts of this state.
6 3. No protective order entered after the filing and
7 microfilming of documents of any kind shall be construed to require
8 the microfilm record of such filing to be amended in any fashion.
9 4. The party or counsel which has received the protective order
10 shall be responsible for promptly presenting the order to
11 appropriate court clerk personnel for appropriate action.
12 5. All documents produced or testimony given under a protective
13 order shall be retained in the office of counsel until required by
14 the court to be filed in the case.
15 6. Counsel for the respective parties shall be responsible for
16 informing witnesses, as necessary, of the contents of the protective
17 order.
18 7. When a case is filed in which a party intends to seek a
19 protective order removing material from the public record, the
20 plaintiff(s) and defendant(s) shall be initially designated on the
21 petition under pseudonym such as "John or Jane Doe", or "Roe", and
22 the petition shall clearly indicate that the party designations are
23 fictitious. The party seeking confidentiality or other order
24 removing the case, in whole or in part, from the public record,
Req. No. 13123 Page 17

1 shal l immediately present application to the court, seeking
2 instructions for the conduct of the case, including confidentiality
3 of the records.
4 D. SEQUENCE AND TIMING OF DISCOVERY. Unless the parties
5 stipulate or the court orders otherwise for the convenience of
6 parties and witnesses and in the interests of justice, methods of
7 discovery may be used in any sequence. The fact that a party is
8 conducting discovery, whether by deposition or otherwise, shall not
9 operate to delay discovery by any other party.
10 E. SUPPLEMENTATION OF RESPONSES. A party who has responded to
11 a request for discovery with a response that was complete when it
12 was made is under no duty to supplement the response to include
13 information thereafter acquired, except as follows:
14 1. A party is under a duty seasonably to supplement the
15 response with respect to any question directly addressed to:
16 a. the identity and location of persons having knowledge
17 of discoverable matters, and
18 b. the identity of each person expected to be called as
19 an expert witness at trial, the subject matter on
20 which the person is expected to testify, and the
21 substance of the testimony of the person;
22 2. A party is under a duty seasonably to amend a prior response
23 to an interrogatory, request for production, or request for
24 admission if the party obtains information upon the basis of which:
Req. No. 13123 Page 18

1 a. (1) the party knows that the response was incorrect
2 in some material respect when made, or
3 (2) the party knows that the response, which was
4 correct when made, is no longer true in some
5 material respect, and
6 b. the additional or corrective information has not
7 otherwise been made known to the other parties during
8 the discovery process or in writing; and
9 3. A duty to supplement responses may be imposed by order of
10 the court, agreement of the parties, or at any time prior to trial
11 through new requests for supplementation of prior responses.
12 F. DISCOVERY CONFERENCE. At any time after commencement of an
13 action, the court may direct the attorneys for the parties to appear
14 for a conference on the subject of discovery. The court shall do so
15 upon motion by the attorney for any party if the motion includes:
16 1. A statement of the issues as they then appear;
17 2. A proposed plan and schedule of discovery;
18 3. Any limitations proposed to be placed on discovery;
19 4. Any other proposed orders with respect to discovery; and
20 5. A statement showing that the attorney making the motion has
21 made a reasonable effort to reach agreement with opposing attorneys
22 on the matters set forth in the motion.
23 Each party and his attorney are under a duty to participate in
24 good faith in the framing of a discovery plan if a plan is proposed
Req. No. 13123 Page 19

1 by t he attorney for any party. Notice of the motion shall be served
2 on all parties. Objections or additions to matters set forth in the
3 motion shall be served not later than ten (10) days after service of
4 the motion.
5 Following the discovery conference, the court shall enter an
6 order tentatively identifying the issues for discovery purposes,
7 establishing a plan and schedule for discovery, setting limitations
8 on discovery, if any; and determining such other matters, including
9 the allocation of expenses, as are necessary for the proper
10 management of discovery in the action. In preparing the plan for
11 discovery the court shall protect the parties from excessive or
12 abusive use of discovery. An order shall be altered or amended
13 whenever justice so requires.
14 Subject to the right of a party who properly moves for a
15 discovery conference to prompt convening of the conference, the
16 court may combine the discovery conference with a pretrial
17 conference.
18 G. SIGNING OF DISCOVERY REQUESTS, RESPONSES AND OBJECTIONS.
19 Every request for discovery, response or objection thereto made by a
20 party represented by an attorney shall be signed by at least one of
21 the party's attorneys of record in the party's individual name whose
22 address shall be stated. A party who is not represented by an
23 attorney shall sign the request, response or objection and state the
24 party's address. The signature of the attorney or party constitutes
Req. No. 13123 Page 20

1 a ce rtification that the party has read the request, response or
2 objection, and that it is:
3 1. To the best of the party's knowledge, information and belief
4 formed after a reasonable inquiry consistent with the Oklahoma
5 Discovery Code and warranted by existing law or a good-faith
6 argument for the extension, modification or reversal of existing
7 law;
8 2. Interposed in good faith and not primarily to cause delay or
9 for any other improper purpose; and
10 3. Not unreasonable or unduly burdensome or expensive, given
11 the nature and complexity of the case, the discovery already had in
12 the case, the amount in controversy, and other values at stake in
13 the litigation. If a request, response or objection is not signed,
14 it shall be deemed ineffective.
15 If a certification is made in violation of the provisions of
16 this subsection, the court, upon motion or upon its own initiative,
17 shall impose upon the person who made the certification, the party
18 on whose behalf the request, response or objection is made, or both,
19 an appropriate sanction, which may include an order to pay to the
20 amount of the reasonable expenses occasioned thereby, including a
21 reasonable attorney fee.
22 SECTION 3. NEW LAW A new section of law to be codified
23 in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 3226.2 of Title 12, unless there
24 is created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:
Req. No. 13123 Page 21

1 As used in the Oklahoma Discovery Code:
2 1. "Commercial litigation funder" means any person or entity,
3 other than an attorney permitted to charge a contingent fee for
4 representing a party, that enters into a contract establishing a
5 right to receive compensation that is contingent on and sourced from
6 any proceeds of the civil action by settlement, judgment, or
7 otherwise. Commercial litigation funder shall not include a
8 consumer litigation funder as defined in Section 3-801 of Title 14A
9 of the Oklahoma Statutes; and
10 2. "Commercial litigation funding agreement" means an agreement
11 under which the commercial litigation funder is granted a right to
12 receive compensation contingent on and sourced from any proceeds of
13 a civil action by settlement, judgment, or otherwise. A commercial
14 litigation funding agreement shall not include:
15 a. legal representation services provided on a
16 contingency fee basis or legal costs advanced by a
17 legal representative where such services or costs are
18 provided to or on behalf of a client by an attorney
19 representing the party in the dispute and in
20 accordance with the Oklahoma Rules of Professional
21 Conduct,
22 b. an agreement entered into between an attorney or law
23 firm and a commercial litigation funder or any other
24 entity. Sharing of fees by an attorney or law firm
Req. No. 13123 Page 22

1 shall be in accordance with the Oklahoma Rules of
2 Professional Conduct including but not limited to
3 Rules 1.5 and 5.4 of Appendix 3-A of Title 5 of the
4 Oklahoma Statutes, or
5 c. a consumer litigation funding agreement as defined in
6 Section 3-801 of Title 14A of the Oklahoma Statutes.
7 SECTION 4. This act shall become effective November 1, 2025.
