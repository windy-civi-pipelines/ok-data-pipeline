a domestic limited liability company or registered series whose

under subsection B of Section 2012.1 of this title, or a foreign
24

1

2
3

4
5
1. Filing all delinquent annual certificates with the Secretary
5

10
11
or was withdrawn, and its current name, if its name at the time it

12
ceased to be in good standing or was withdrawn is no longer
12
13
available under Section 2008 or 2045 of this title.
13
14
If the Secretary of State determines that the application
14
15
contains the required information, the information is correct, all
15
16
delinquent certificates or other filings are submitted, all
16
17
delinquent fees are paid, and the name satisfies the requirements of
17
18
Section 2008 or 2045 of this title, the Secretary of State shall
18
19
accept the application for reinstatement and issue a certificate of
19
20
reinstatement in the manner provided in Section 2007 of this title
20
21
for domestic limited liability companies, Section 14 2054.5 of this
21
22
act title for domestic registered series, or Section 2044 of this
22
23

Req. No. 70 Page 2

1
required to change its name because its name at the time it ceased
1
2

2
3
acceptance of the reinstatement shall constitute an amendment to the
3
4
domestic limited liability company’s articles of organization or the
4
5
domestic registered series’ articles of registered series to change
5
6
its name or the adoption of a fictitious name by the foreign limited

13
14
that the application may not extend the term of a limited liability
14
15
company or registered series that had expired before the application
15
16
for reinstatement. For purposes of this section, a foreign limited
16
17

19

23
ceased to be in good standing and as if its articles of organization
23
24
or articles of registered series, as the case may be, had never been
24

3
4
registered series or foreign limited liability company or registered

6
7
impair the validity on any contract, deed, mortgage, security
7
8
interest, lien or act of the domestic limited liability company or
8
9

9
10
series or prevent the domestic limited liability company or

21
registered series after its reinstatement as fully as they were held
21
