propose an amendment to the Constitution of the
8 United States of America related to expenditure of
funds in the political process; making findings; and

12 WHEREAS, the Constitution of the State of Oklahoma provides:
13 "All political power is inherent in the people; and government is
14 instituted for their protection, security, and benefit, and to
15 promote their general welfare; and they have the right to alter or
16 reform the same whenever the public good may require it: Provided,
17 such change be not repugnant to the Constitution of the United
18 States"; and
19 WHEREAS, the People of Oklahoma believe that elected
20 representatives should be responsive to the interests of their
21 actual constituents, as evidenced by the Oklahoma Legislature's
22 April 23, 2023, Joint Resolution No. 1032 in favor of a term limits
23 amendment to the United States Constitution; and
24
ENGR. H. C. R. NO. 1006 Page 1
1 WHEREAS, the People of Oklahoma have a compelling sovereign
2 interest in fostering robust political debate and self-government,
3 protecting the free speech interests of all individuals, securing
4 the liberty and political equality of our citizens, guarding against
5 corruption, and advancing federalism and the interests of the
6 several States; and
7 WHEREAS, States may determine that reasonable regulation of how
8 money is used to influence the outcomes of elections would (1)
9 secure the interests of citizens of that State to be represented and
10 participate in elections and self-government, and (2) protect the
11 integrity of elections and government against out-of-state and
12 foreign interests and undue influence of wealthy special interests,
13 whether of corporations, unions, or other artificial entities; and
14 WHEREAS, over the past five decades, the Supreme Court has
15 gradually come to equate unlimited election spending with "free
16 speech". This unlimited spending — often hard to trace, and coming
17 from out-of-state and even foreign interests — is drowning out the
18 free speech interests of actual constituents, narrowing debate,
19 weakening federalism and self-governance in the States, and
20 increasing the risk of systemic corruption; and
21 WHEREAS, the Framers wisely granted the States power to amend
22 the Constitution when necessary to make it, and our Union, ever more
23 perfect and to protect and preserve self-government and liberty.
