12
order to effectively and efficiently implement and administer the

have no force or effect only if a court of competent jurisdiction
14
15
holds that the Rule is invalid because the Compact Commission
15
16
exercised its rulemaking authority in a manner that is beyond the

scope and purposes of the Compact, or the powers granted hereunder,
17
18
or based upon another applicable standard of review.

alternative dispute resolution proceedings. Nothing herein shall

1
2
of any Member State, a State seeking participation in the Compact,
2

or of the United States, or the applicability thereof to any

government, agency, person, or circumstance is held to be

13
purposes and provisions of the Compact. A Rule shall be invalid and
13
14
have no force or effect only if a court of competent jurisdiction
14
15
holds that the Rule is invalid because the Compact Commission
15
16
exercised its rulemaking authority in a manner that is beyond the
16
17
scope and purposes of the Compact, or the powers granted hereunder,
17
18
or based upon another applicable standard of review.
18
19
B. The Rules of the Compact Commission shall have the force of
19
20
law in each Member State; provided, however, that where the Rules
20
21
conflict with the laws or regulations of a Member State that relate
21
22
to the procedures, actions, and processes a Licensed Dietitian is
22
23
permitted to undertake in that State and the circumstances under
23
24
which they may do so, as held by a court of competent jurisdiction,

15
16
effective date for the Rule. Except for an emergency as provided in
16
17

Req. No. 852 Page 35

The revision shall be subject to challenge by any person for a
16

20
21

1. The executive and judicial branches of State government in
5
6
each Member State shall enforce this Compact and take all actions
6
7
necessary and appropriate to implement this Compact.

9
10
shall be brought solely and exclusively in a court of competent
10
11
jurisdiction where the principal office of the Compact Commission is
11
12
located. The Compact Commission may waive venue and jurisdictional
12
13
defenses to the extent it adopts or consents to participate in
13
14
alternative dispute resolution proceedings. Nothing herein shall
14
15
affect or limit the selection or propriety of venue in any action
15
16
against a Licensee for professional malpractice, misconduct, or any
16
17
such similar matter.

18
19
of process in any proceeding regarding the enforcement or
19
20
interpretation of the Compact and shall have standing to intervene
20
21
in such a proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide the
21
22
Compact Commission service of process shall render a judgment or
22
23
order void as to the Compact Commission, this Compact, or
23
24
promulgated Rules.

1
2
1. If the Compact Commission determines that a Member State has
2
3
defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities
3
4
under this Compact or the promulgated Rules, the Compact Commission
4
5
shall provide written notice to the defaulting State. The notice of
5
6
default shall describe the default, the proposed means of curing the
6
7
default, and any other action that the Compact Commission may take
7
8
and shall offer training and specific technical assistance regarding
8
9
the default.
9
10
2. The Compact Commission shall provide a copy of the notice of
10
11

12
13
defaulting State may be terminated from the Compact upon an
13
14
affirmative vote of a majority of the delegates of the Member
14
15
States, and all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred on that
15
16
State by this Compact may be terminated on the effective date of
16
17
termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending
17
18
State of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of
18
19
default.
19
20
D. Termination of membership in the Compact shall be imposed
20

5
6
beyond the effective date of termination.
6
7
F. Upon the termination of a State’s membership from this
7
8
Compact, that State shall immediately provide notice to all
8
9
Licensees within that State of such termination. The terminated

State shall continue to recognize all Compact Privileges granted
10
11
pursuant to this Compact for a minimum of six (6) months after the
11
12
date of said notice of termination.
12
13
G. The Compact Commission shall not bear any costs related to a
13
14
State that is found to be in default or that has been terminated
14
15
from the Compact, unless agreed upon in writing between the Compact
15
16
Commission and the defaulting State.
16
17
H. The defaulting State may appeal the action of the Compact
17
18
Commission by petitioning the United States District Court for the
18
19
District of Columbia or the federal district where the Compact
19
20
Commission has its principal offices. The prevailing party shall be
20
21
awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable
21

10
11
where the Compact Commission has its principal offices to enforce
11
12
compliance with the provisions of the Compact and its promulgated
12
13
Rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and
13
14
damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the
14
15
prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation,
15
16
including reasonable attorney’s fees. The remedies herein shall not
16
17
be the exclusive remedies of the Compact Commission. The Compact
17
18
Commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal or
18
19
the defaulting Member State’s law.
19
20
2. A Member State may initiate legal action against the Compact

4
5
or in furtherance of the purposes of the administration of the

8
9
Compact Commission.
9
10
4. Any State that joins the Compact subsequent to the Compact
10
11
Commission’s initial adoption of the Rules and bylaws shall be
11

17
A. This Compact and the Compact Commission’s rulemaking

authority shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the
18
19
purposes and the implementation and administration of the Compact.
19
20
Provisions of the Compact expressly authorizing or requiring the
20
21
promulgation of Rules shall not be construed to limit the Compact
21
22
Commission’s rulemaking authority solely for those purposes.
22
23
B. The provisions of this Compact shall be severable and if any
23
24
phrase, clause, sentence, or provision of this Compact is held by a
24
Req. No. 852 Page 43

1
court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to the constitution
1
2
of any Member State, a State seeking participation in the Compact,
2
3
or of the United States, or the applicability thereof to any
3
4
government, agency, person, or circumstance is held to be
4
5
unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, the validity
5
6
of the remainder of this Compact and the applicability thereof to
6
7
any other government, agency, person, or circumstance shall not be
7
8
affected thereby.

deny a State’s participation in the Compact or, in accordance with

12
participation in the Compact, if it determines that a constitutional
12
13
requirement of a Member State is a material departure from the
13
14
Compact. Otherwise, if this Compact shall be held to be contrary to
14
15
the constitution of any Member State, the Compact shall remain in
15
16

16
17
force and effect as to the Member State affected as to all severable
17
18
