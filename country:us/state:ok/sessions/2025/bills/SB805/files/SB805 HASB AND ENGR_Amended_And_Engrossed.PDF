9 provided that the actual or alleged act, error, or omission did not
10 result from the intentional or willful or wanton misconduct of that

1 A. The Compact Commission shall promulgate reasonable Rules in
2 order to effectively and efficiently implement and administer the
3 purposes and provisions of the Compact. A Rule shall be invalid and

24 Rule;
ENGR. H. A. to ENGR. S. B. NO. 805 Page 34

11 all written comments and documents received by the Compact
12 Commission in response to the proposed Rule shall be available to
13 the public.

15 reasonably possible, in no event later than ninety (90) days after
16 the effective date of the Rule. For the purposes of this provision,
17 an emergency Rule is one that must be adopted immediately in order
18 to:
19 1. Meet an imminent threat to public health, safety, or
20 welfare;
21 2. Prevent a loss of Compact Commission or Member State funds;
22 3. Meet a deadline for the promulgation of a Rule that is

5 revision shall be posted on the website of the Compact Commission.
6 The revision shall be subject to challenge by any person for a
7 period of thirty (30) days after posting. The revision may be
8 challenged only on grounds that the revision results in a material
9 change to a Rule. A challenge shall be made in writing and
10 delivered to the Compact Commission prior to the end of the notice

24 jurisdiction where the principal office of the Compact Commission is
ENGR. H. A. to ENGR. S. B. NO. 805 Page 37

1 loca ted. The Compact Commission may waive venue and jurisdictional
2 defenses to the extent it adopts or consents to participate in

5 against a Licensee for professional malpractice, misconduct, or any
6 such similar matter.
7 3. The Compact Commission shall be entitled to receive service
8 of process in any proceeding regarding the enforcement or
9 interpretation of the Compact and shall have standing to intervene

3 affirmative vote of a majority of the delegates of the Member
4 States, and all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred on that

6 termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending
7 State of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of
8 default.
9 D. Termination of membership in the Compact shall be imposed
10 only after all other means of securing compliance have been
11 exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given
12 by the Compact Commission to the governor, the majority and minority
13 leaders of the defaulting State’s legislature, the defaulting
14 State’s Licensing Authority, and each of the Member States’

8 Commission by petitioning the United States District Court for the

19 appropriate.
20 J. Enforcement.
21 1. By supermajority vote, the Compact Commission may initiate
22 legal action against a Member State in default in the United States
23 District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district
24 where the Compact Commission has its principal offices to enforce
ENGR. H. A. to ENGR. S. B. NO. 805 Page 40

6 welfare;
7 2. Prevent a loss of Compact Commission or Member State funds;
8 3. Meet a deadline for the promulgation of a Rule that is

13 defenses to the extent it adopts or consents to participate in
14 alternative dispute resolution proceedings. Nothing herein shall

16 against a Licensee for professional malpractice, misconduct, or any
17 such similar matter.
18 3. The Compact Commission shall be entitled to receive service
19 of process in any proceeding regarding the enforcement or

1 B. Default, Technical Assistance, and Termination.
2 1. If the Compact Commission determines that a Member State has

11 default to the other Member States.
12 C. If a State in default fails to cure the default, the

14 affirmative vote of a majority of the delegates of the Member
15 States, and all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred on that

21 only after all other means of securing compliance have been
22 exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given

10 deny a State’s participation in the Compact or, in accordance with
11 the requirements of Section 11(B), terminate a Member State’s
12 participation in the Compact, if it determines that a constitutional
13 requirement of a Member State is a material departure from the
14 Compact. Otherwise, if this Compact shall be held to be contrary to
15 the constitution of any Member State, the Compact shall remain in
16 full force and effect as to the remaining Member States and in full
17 force and effect as to the Member State affected as to all severable
18 matters.
