and liability, both personally and in their official capacity, for
any claim for damage to or loss of property or personal injury or
other civil liability caused by or arising out of any actual or
alleged act, error, or omission that occurred, or that the person
against whom the claim is made had a reasonable basis for believing
ENR. S. B. NO. 805 Page 21

occurred within the scope of Compact Commission employment, duties,
or responsibilities; provided, that nothing in this paragraph shall
be construed to protect any such person from suit or liability for
any damage, loss, injury, or liability caused by the intentional or
willful or wanton misconduct of that person. The procurement of
insurance of any type by the Compact Commission shall not in any way
compromise or limit the immunity granted hereunder.
2. The Compact Commission shall defend any member, officer,
executive director, employee, and representative of the Compact
Commission in any civil action seeking to impose liability arising
out of any actual or alleged act, error, or omission that occurred
within the scope of Compact Commission employment, duties, or
responsibilities, or as determined by the Compact Commission that
the person against whom the claim is made had a reasonable basis for
believing occurred within the scope of Compact Commission
employment, duties, or responsibilities; provided that nothing
herein shall be construed to prohibit that person from retaining
their own counsel at their own expense; and provided further, that
the actual or alleged act, error, or omission did not result from
that person’s intentional or willful or wanton misconduct.
3. The Compact Commission shall indemnify and hold harmless any
member, officer, executive director, employee, and representative of
the Compact Commission for the amount of any settlement or judgment
obtained against that person arising out of any actual or alleged
act, error, or omission that occurred within the scope of Compact
Commission employment, duties, or responsibilities, or that such
person had a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the
scope of Compact Commission employment, duties, or responsibilities,
provided that the actual or alleged act, error, or omission did not
result from the intentional or willful or wanton misconduct of that
person.
4. Nothing herein shall be construed as a limitation on the
liability of any Licensee for professional malpractice or
misconduct, which shall be governed solely by any other applicable
State laws.
5. Nothing in this Compact shall be interpreted to waive or
otherwise abrogate a Member State’s state action immunity or state
action affirmative defense with respect to antitrust claims under
ENR. S. B. NO. 805 Page 22

the Sherman Act, Clayton Act, or any other State or federal
antitrust or anticompetitive law or regulation.
6. Nothing in this Compact shall be construed to be a waiver of
sovereign immunity by the Member States or by the Compact
Commission.
SECTION 9: DATA SYSTEM
A. The Compact Commission shall provide for the development,
maintenance, operation, and utilization of a coordinated Data
System.
B. The Compact Commission shall assign each applicant for a
Compact Privilege a unique identifier, as determined by the Rules.

contrary, a Member State shall submit a uniform data set to the Data
System on all individuals to whom this Compact is applicable as
required by the Rules of the Compact Commission, including:
1. Identifying information;
2. Licensure data;
3. Adverse Actions against a License or Compact Privilege and
information related thereto;

for such denial;
6. The presence of Current Significant Investigative

this Compact or the protection of the public, as determined by the
Rules of the Compact Commission.
ENR. S. B. NO. 805 Page 23

D. The records and information provided to a Member State
pursuant to this Compact or through the Data System, when certified
by the Compact Commission or an agent thereof, shall constitute the
authenticated business records of the Compact Commission, and shall
be entitled to any associated hearsay exception in any relevant
judicial, quasi-judicial, or administrative proceedings in a Member
State.
E. Current Significant Investigative Information pertaining to
a Licensee in any Member State will only be available to other
Member States.
F. It is the responsibility of the Member States to report any
Adverse Action against a Licensee and to monitor the Data System to
determine whether any Adverse Action has been taken against a
Licensee. Adverse Action information pertaining to a Licensee in
any Member State will be available to any other Member State.
G. Member States contributing information to the Data System
may designate information that may not be shared with the public
without the express permission of the contributing State.

Data System.
SECTION 10: RULEMAKING
A. The Compact Commission shall promulgate reasonable Rules in
order to effectively and efficiently implement and administer the
purposes and provisions of the Compact. A Rule shall be invalid and
have no force or effect only if a court of competent jurisdiction
holds that the Rule is invalid because the Compact Commission
exercised its rulemaking authority in a manner that is beyond the
scope and purposes of the Compact, or the powers granted hereunder,
or based upon another applicable standard of review.
B. The Rules of the Compact Commission shall have the force of
law in each Member State; provided, however, that where the Rules
conflict with the laws or regulations of a Member State that relate
ENR. S. B. NO. 805 Page 24

to the procedures, actions, and processes a Licensed Dietitian is
permitted to undertake in that State and the circumstances under
which they may do so, as held by a court of competent jurisdiction,
the Rules of the Compact Commission shall be ineffective in that
State to the extent of the conflict.
C. The Compact Commission shall exercise its rulemaking powers
pursuant to the criteria set forth in this section and the Rules
adopted thereunder. Rules shall become binding on the day following
adoption or as of the date specified in the Rule or amendment,
whichever is later.
D. If a majority of the legislatures of the Member States
rejects a Rule or portion of a Rule, by enactment of a statute or
resolution in the same manner used to adopt the Compact within four
(4) years of the date of adoption of the Rule, then such Rule shall
have no further force and effect in any Member State.
E. Rules shall be adopted at a regular or special meeting of
the Compact Commission.
F. Prior to adoption of a proposed Rule, the Compact Commission
shall hold a public hearing and allow persons to provide oral and
written comments, data, facts, opinions, and arguments.
G. Prior to adoption of a proposed Rule by the Compact
Commission, and at least thirty (30) days in advance of the meeting
at which the Compact Commission will hold a public hearing on the
proposed Rule, the Compact Commission shall provide a Notice of
Proposed rulemaking:
1. On the website of the Compact Commission or other publicly
accessible platform;
2. To persons who have requested notice of the Compact
Commission’s notices of proposed rulemaking; and
3. In such other way(s) as the Compact Commission may by Rule
specify.
H. The Notice of Proposed rulemaking shall include:
ENR. S. B. NO. 805 Page 25

1. The time, date, and location of the public hearing at which
the Compact Commission will hear public comments on the proposed
Rule and, if different, the time, date, and location of the meeting
where the Compact Commission will consider and vote on the proposed
Rule;
2. If the hearing is held via telecommunication, video
conference, or other means of communication, the Compact Commission
shall include the mechanism for access to the hearing in the Notice
of Proposed rulemaking;
3. The text of the proposed Rule and the reason therefore;
4. A request for comments on the proposed Rule from any
interested person; and
5. The manner in which interested persons may submit written
comments.
I. All hearings will be recorded. A copy of the recording and
all written comments and documents received by the Compact
Commission in response to the proposed Rule shall be available to
the public.
J. Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a
separate hearing on each Rule. Rules may be grouped for the
convenience of the Compact Commission at hearings required by this
section.
K. The Compact Commission shall, by majority vote of all
members, take final action on the proposed Rule based on the
rulemaking record and the full text of the Rule.
1. The Compact Commission may adopt changes to the proposed
Rule provided the changes do not enlarge the original purpose of the
proposed Rule.
2. The Compact Commission shall provide an explanation of the
reasons for substantive changes made to the proposed Rule as well as
reasons for substantive changes not made that were recommended by
commenters.
ENR. S. B. NO. 805 Page 26

3. The Compact Commission shall determine a reasonable
effective date for the Rule. Except for an emergency as provided in
Section 10(L), the effective date of the Rule shall be no sooner
than thirty (30) days after issuing the notice that it adopted or
amended the Rule.
L. Upon determination that an emergency exists, the Compact
Commission may consider and adopt an emergency Rule with twenty-four
(24) hours’ notice, with opportunity to comment, provided that the
usual rulemaking procedures provided in the Compact and in this
section shall be retroactively applied to the Rule as soon as
reasonably possible, in no event later than ninety (90) days after
the effective date of the Rule. For the purposes of this provision,
an emergency Rule is one that must be adopted immediately in order
to:
1. Meet an imminent threat to public health, safety, or
welfare;
2. Prevent a loss of Compact Commission or Member State funds;
3. Meet a deadline for the promulgation of a Rule that is
established by federal law or rule; or
4. Protect public health and safety.
M. The Compact Commission or an authorized committee of the
Compact Commission may direct revision to a previously adopted Rule
for purposes of correcting typographical errors, errors in format,
errors in consistency, or grammatical errors. Public notice of any
revision shall be posted on the website of the Compact Commission.
The revision shall be subject to challenge by any person for a
period of thirty (30) days after posting. The revision may be
challenged only on grounds that the revision results in a material
change to a Rule. A challenge shall be made in writing and
delivered to the Compact Commission prior to the end of the notice
period. If no challenge is made, the revision will take effect
without further action. If the revision is challenged, the revision
may not take effect without the approval of the Compact Commission.
N. No Member State’s rulemaking requirements shall apply under
this Compact.
ENR. S. B. NO. 805 Page 27

SECTION 11: OVERSIGHT, DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AND ENFORCEMENT
A. Oversight.
1. The executive and judicial branches of State government in
each Member State shall enforce this Compact and take all actions
necessary and appropriate to implement this Compact.
2. Except as otherwise provided in this Compact, venue is
proper and judicial proceedings by or against the Compact Commission
shall be brought solely and exclusively in a court of competent
jurisdiction where the principal office of the Compact Commission is
located. The Compact Commission may waive venue and jurisdictional
defenses to the extent it adopts or consents to participate in
alternative dispute resolution proceedings. Nothing herein shall
affect or limit the selection or propriety of venue in any action
against a Licensee for professional malpractice, misconduct, or any
such similar matter.
3. The Compact Commission shall be entitled to receive service
of process in any proceeding regarding the enforcement or
interpretation of the Compact and shall have standing to intervene
in such a proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide the
Compact Commission service of process shall render a judgment or
order void as to the Compact Commission, this Compact, or
promulgated Rules.
B. Default, Technical Assistance, and Termination.
1. If the Compact Commission determines that a Member State has
defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities
under this Compact or the promulgated Rules, the Compact Commission
shall provide written notice to the defaulting State. The notice of
default shall describe the default, the proposed means of curing the
default, and any other action that the Compact Commission may take
and shall offer training and specific technical assistance regarding
the default.
2. The Compact Commission shall provide a copy of the notice of
default to the other Member States.
ENR. S. B. NO. 805 Page 28

C. If a State in default fails to cure the default, the
defaulting State may be terminated from the Compact upon an
affirmative vote of a majority of the delegates of the Member
States, and all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred on that
State by this Compact may be terminated on the effective date of
termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending
State of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of
default.
D. Termination of membership in the Compact shall be imposed
only after all other means of securing compliance have been
exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given
by the Compact Commission to the governor, the majority and minority
leaders of the defaulting State’s legislature, the defaulting
State’s Licensing Authority, and each of the Member States’
Licensing Authorities.
E. A State that has been terminated is responsible for all
assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the
effective date of termination, including obligations that extend
beyond the effective date of termination.
F. Upon the termination of a State’s membership from this
Compact, that State shall immediately provide notice to all
Licensees within that State of such termination. The terminated
State shall continue to recognize all Compact Privileges granted
pursuant to this Compact for a minimum of six (6) months after the
date of said notice of termination.
G. The Compact Commission shall not bear any costs related to a
State that is found to be in default or that has been terminated
from the Compact, unless agreed upon in writing between the Compact
Commission and the defaulting State.
H. The defaulting State may appeal the action of the Compact
Commission by petitioning the United States District Court for the
District of Columbia or the federal district where the Compact
Commission has its principal offices. The prevailing party shall be
awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable
attorney’s fees.
I. Dispute Resolution.
ENR. S. B. NO. 805 Page 29

1. Upon request by a Member State, the Compact Commission shall
attempt to resolve disputes related to the Compact that arise among
Member States and between Member and non-Member States.
2. The Compact Commission shall promulgate a Rule providing for
both mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes as
appropriate.
J. Enforcement.
1. By supermajority vote, the Compact Commission may initiate
legal action against a Member State in default in the United States
District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district
where the Compact Commission has its principal offices to enforce
compliance with the provisions of the Compact and its promulgated
Rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and
damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the
prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation,
including reasonable attorney’s fees. The remedies herein shall not
be the exclusive remedies of the Compact Commission. The Compact
Commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal or
the defaulting Member State’s law.
2. A Member State may initiate legal action against the Compact
Commission in the United States District Court for the District of
Columbia or the federal district where the Compact Commission has
its principal offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of
the Compact and its promulgated Rules. The relief sought may
include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial
enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all
costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney’s fees.
3. No party other than a Member State shall enforce this
Compact against the Compact Commission.
SECTION 12: EFFECTIVE DATE, WITHDRAWAL, AND AMENDMENT
A. The Compact shall come into effect on the date on which the
Compact statute is enacted into law in the seventh Member State.
ENR. S. B. NO. 805 Page 30

1. On or after the effective date of the Compact, the Compact
Commission shall convene and review the enactment of each of the
first seven Member States (“Charter Member States”) to determine if
the statute enacted by each such Charter Member State is materially
different than the model Compact statute.
a. A Charter Member State whose enactment is found to be
materially different from the model Compact statute
shall be entitled to the default process set forth in
Section 11.
b. If any Member State is later found to be in default,
or is terminated, or withdraws from the Compact, the
Compact Commission shall remain in existence and the
Compact shall remain in effect even if the number of
Member States should be less than seven.
2. Member States enacting the Compact subsequent to the seven
initial Charter Member States shall be subject to the process set
forth in Section 8(C)(21) to determine if their enactments are
materially different from the model Compact statute and whether they
qualify for participation in the Compact.
3. All actions taken for the benefit of the Compact Commission
or in furtherance of the purposes of the administration of the
Compact prior to the effective date of the Compact or the Compact
Commission coming into existence shall be considered to be actions
of the Compact Commission unless specifically repudiated by the
Compact Commission.
4. Any State that joins the Compact subsequent to the Compact
Commission’s initial adoption of the Rules and bylaws shall be
subject to the Rules and bylaws as they exist on the date on which
the Compact becomes law in that State. Any Rule that has been
previously adopted by the Compact Commission shall have the full
force and effect of law on the day the Compact becomes law in that
State.
B. Any Member State may withdraw from this Compact by enacting
a statute repealing the same.
ENR. S. B. NO. 805 Page 31

1. A Member State’s withdrawal shall not take effect until one
hundred eighty (180) days after enactment of the repealing statute.
2. Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirement of
the withdrawing State’s Licensing Authority to comply with the
investigative and Adverse Action reporting requirements of this
Compact prior to the effective date of withdrawal.
3. Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing from this
Compact, a State shall immediately provide notice of such withdrawal
to all Licensees within that State. Notwithstanding any subsequent
statutory enactment to the contrary, such withdrawing State shall
continue to recognize all Compact Privileges granted pursuant to
this Compact for a minimum of one hundred eighty (180) days after
the date of such notice of withdrawal.
C. Nothing contained in this Compact shall be construed to
invalidate or prevent any licensure agreement or other cooperative
arrangement between a Member State and a non-Member State that does
not conflict with the provisions of this Compact.
D. This Compact may be amended by the Member States. No
amendment to this Compact shall become effective and binding upon
any Member State until it is enacted into the laws of all Member
States.
SECTION 13: CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY
A. This Compact and the Compact Commission’s rulemaking
authority shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the
purposes and the implementation and administration of the Compact.
Provisions of the Compact expressly authorizing or requiring the
promulgation of Rules shall not be construed to limit the Compact
Commission’s rulemaking authority solely for those purposes.
B. The provisions of this Compact shall be severable and if any
phrase, clause, sentence, or provision of this Compact is held by a
court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to the constitution
of any Member State, a State seeking participation in the Compact,
or of the United States, or the applicability thereof to any
government, agency, person, or circumstance is held to be
unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, the validity
ENR. S. B. NO. 805 Page 32

of the remainder of this Compact and the applicability thereof to
any other government, agency, person, or circumstance shall not be
affected thereby.
C. Notwithstanding Section 13(B), the Compact Commission may
deny a State’s participation in the Compact or, in accordance with
the requirements of Section 11(B), terminate a Member State’s
participation in the Compact, if it determines that a constitutional
requirement of a Member State is a material departure from the
Compact. Otherwise, if this Compact shall be held to be contrary to
the constitution of any Member State, the Compact shall remain in
full force and effect as to the remaining Member States and in full
force and effect as to the Member State affected as to all severable
matters.
SECTION 14: CONSISTENT EFFECT AND CONFLICT WITH OTHER STATE
LAWS
A. Nothing herein shall prevent or inhibit the enforcement of
any other law of a Member State that is not inconsistent with the
Compact.
B. Any laws, statutes, regulations, or other legal requirements
in a Member State in conflict with the Compact are superseded to the
extent of the conflict.
C. All permissible agreements between the Compact Commission
and the Member States are binding in accordance with their terms.
SECTION 3. AMENDATORY 59 O.S. 2021, Section 1727, is

performance of its duties pursuant to the provisions of the Licensed

person upon application to the Board and the payment of such charge
as may be fixed by the Board for such list;
7. comply with the Oklahoma Open Meeting Law.

2. restricts the person's personal appearance or use of his or
her personal voice in an advertisement; or
3. relates to the size or duration of any advertisement by the
person; or
