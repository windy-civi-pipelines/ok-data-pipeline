A. A museum may acquire legal title to loaned property pursuant

lender and the museum occurred, the museum shall send a notice by
certified mail, return receipt requested, to the lender's last-known
address. This notice shall contain a statement that the loan is now
terminated as well as all information required in the notice under
paragraph 1 of subsection A of Section 2 of this act. Notice is

(30) days after mailing the notice. If proof of delivery of the

is required to protect the property on loan or to protect other
property in the custody of the museum, or the property on loan has

1. The museum cannot reach the lender at the lender's last
address of record so that the museum and the lender can promptly
agree on a solution; or

museum recommends, yet is unwilling or unable to terminate the loan
and retrieve the property.
B. If a museum applies conservation measures to or disposes of
property under subsection A of this section, the museum:
1. Has a lien on the property and on the proceeds from any
disposition of the property for the costs incurred by the museum;
and
2. Is not liable for injury to or loss of the property if the
museum:
a. had a reasonable belief at the time the action was
taken that the action was necessary to protect the
property on loan or other property in the custody of
the museum, or that the property on loan constituted a
hazard to the health and safety of the public or the
museum's staff, and
b. exercised reasonable care in the choice and
application of the conservation measures.

undocumented property, the museum:
1. May impose a lien on the undocumented property and on the
proceeds from any disposition of the property for the costs incurred
by the museum; and
2. Is not liable for injury to or loss of the undocumented
property if the museum:
a. had a reasonable belief at the time the action was
taken that the action was necessary to protect the
property or other property in the custody of the
museum, or that the property constituted a hazard to
the health and safety of the public or the museum's
staff, and
b. exercised reasonable care in the choice and
application of the conservation measures.
SECTION 9. NEW LAW A new section of law to be codified
in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 2009 of Title 60, unless there
is created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:
A. An action shall not be brought against a museum for damages
because of injury to or loss of property loaned to the museum more
than two (2) years from the date the museum gives the lender or
person with legal interests notice of the injury or loss or two (2)
years from the date of the injury or loss, whichever occurs earlier.
B. An action shall not be brought against a museum to recover
property more than two (2) years after the date the museum gives the
person with legal interests notice of its intent to acquire the
property.

the museum if the lender fails to file an action to recover the
property on loan to the museum within the time periods specified in
subsections A through C of this section.
ENR. H. B. NO. 2161 Page 7

E. Notwithstanding subsections C and D of this section, a
lender who was not given notice as provided in this act that the
museum intended to terminate a loan as provided in Section 3 of this
act, and who proves that the museum received an adequate notice of
intent to preserve an interest in loaned property, which satisfies
all of the requirements of Section 3 of this act, within the two (2)
years immediately preceding the filing of an action to recover the
property, may recover the property or, if the property has been
disposed of, the reasonable value of the property at the time it was
disposed of plus interest at the legal rate.
F. A museum is not liable at any time, in the absence of a
court order, for returning property to the original lender even if a
person other than the lender has filed a notice of intent to
preserve an interest in property. If a person claims competing
interests in property in the possession of a museum, the burden is
upon the claimant to prove the interest in an action in equity
initiated by a claimant. A museum is not liable at any time for
returning property to an uncontested claimant who produced
reasonable proof of ownership or the existence of a security
interest pursuant to Section 3 of this act.
SECTION 10. NEW LAW A new section of law to be codified
in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 2010 of Title 60, unless there
is created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:
Loaned property in the possession of a museum at the time of the
owner's death, which would otherwise escheat to the state, shall not
so escheat but shall become property of the museum to which it is
loaned.
SECTION 11. This act shall become effective November 1, 2025.
