22 intent to preserve an interest in loaned property, which satisfies
23 all of the requirements of Section 3 of this act, within the two (2)
24 years immediately preceding the filing of an action to recover the
Req. No. 11602 Page 10

21 SECTION 11. This act shall become effective November 1, 2025.
