3 SECTION 8. NEW LAW A new section of law to be codified
4 in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 2008 of Title 60, unless there
5 is created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:
6 A. A museum may apply conservation measures to or dispose of
7 undocumented property in possession of the museum if immediate
8 action is required to protect the property or to protect other
9 property in the custody of the museum, or the property has become a
10 hazard to the health and safety of the public or of the museum's
11 staff.
12 B. If a museum applies conservation measures to or disposes of
13 undocumented property, the museum:
14 1. May impose a lien on the undocumented property and on the
15 proceeds from any disposition of the property for the costs incurred
16 by the museum; and

22 museum, or that the property constituted a hazard to
23 the health and safety of the public or the museum's
24 staff, and

1 b. exercised reasonable care in the choice and
2 application of the conservation measures.
3 SECTION 9. NEW LAW A new section of law to be codified
4 in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 2009 of Title 60, unless there
5 is created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:
6 A. An action shall not be brought against a museum for damages
7 because of injury to or loss of property loaned to the museum more
8 than two (2) years from the date the museum gives the lender or
9 person with legal interests notice of the injury or loss or two (2)
10 years from the date of the injury or loss, whichever occurs earlier.
11 B. An action shall not be brought against a museum to recover
12 property more than two (2) years after the date the museum gives the
13 person with legal interests notice of its intent to acquire the
14 property.
15 C. An action shall not be brought against a museum to recover
16 property on loan more than two (2) years from the date of the last
17 written contact between the lender or person with legal interest and
18 the museum as evidenced by the museum's records.
19 D. A lender is considered to have donated loaned property to
20 the museum if the lender fails to file an action to recover the
21 property on loan to the museum within the time periods specified in
22 subsections A through C of this section.
23 E. Notwithstanding subsections C and D of this section, a
24 lender who was not given notice as provided in this act that the

1 muse um intended to terminate a loan as provided in Section 3 of this
2 act, and who proves that the museum received an adequate notice of
3 intent to preserve an interest in loaned property, which satisfies
4 all of the requirements of Section 3 of this act, within the two (2)
5 years immediately preceding the filing of an action to recover the
6 property, may recover the property or, if the property has been
7 disposed of, the reasonable value of the property at the time it was
8 disposed of plus interest at the legal rate.
9 F. A museum is not liable at any time, in the absence of a
10 court order, for returning property to the original lender even if a
11 person other than the lender has filed a notice of intent to
12 preserve an interest in property. If a person claims competing
13 interests in property in the possession of a museum, the burden is
14 upon the claimant to prove the interest in an action in equity
15 initiated by a claimant. A museum is not liable at any time for
16 returning property to an uncontested claimant who produced
17 reasonable proof of ownership or the existence of a security
18 interest pursuant to Section 3 of this act.
19 SECTION 10. NEW LAW A new section of law to be codified
20 in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 2010 of Title 60, unless there
21 is created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:
22 Loaned property in the possession of a museum at the time of the
23 owner's death, which would otherwise escheat to the state, shall not
