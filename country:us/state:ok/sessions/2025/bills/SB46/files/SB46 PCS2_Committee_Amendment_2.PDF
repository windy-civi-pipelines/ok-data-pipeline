4 1. There shall be added interest income on obligations of any
5 state or political subdivision thereto which is not otherwise

1 b. For carryovers and carrybacks to taxable years
2 beginning after December 31, 1980, the amount of any
3 net operating loss deduction allowed for the taxable

14 within the state where the shipment to such
15 warehouses is not covered by “in transit”
16 tariffs, as prescribed and allowed by the

19 the Oklahoma net income shall, at the option of the
20 taxpayer, be that portion of the total net income of

9 and 2 of this subsection, apportioned as follows:
10 (1) except as otherwise provided by division (2) of
11 this subparagraph, taxable income of an insurance
12 company for a taxable year shall be apportioned
13 to this state by multiplying such income by a
14 fraction, the numerator of which is the direct
15 premiums written for insurance on property or
16 risks in this state, and the denominator of which
17 is the direct premiums written for insurance on
18 property or risks everywhere. For purposes of
19 this subsection, the term “direct premiums
20 written” means the total amount of direct
21 premiums written, assessments and annuity
22 considerations as reported for the taxable year
23 on the annual statement filed by the company with
24 the Insurance Commissioner in the form approved

2 Commissioners, or such other form as may be
3 prescribed in lieu thereof,
4 (2) if the principal source of premiums written by an
5 insurance company consists of premiums for
6 reinsurance accepted by it, the taxable income of
7 such company shall be apportioned to this state
8 by multiplying such income by a fraction, the
9 numerator of which is the sum of (a) direct
10 premiums written for insurance on property or
11 risks in this state, plus (b) premiums written
12 for reinsurance accepted in respect of property
13 or risks in this state, and the denominator of
14 which is the sum of (c) direct premiums written
15 for insurance on property or risks everywhere,
16 plus (d) premiums written for reinsurance
17 accepted in respect of property or risks
18 everywhere. For purposes of this paragraph,
19 premiums written for reinsurance accepted in
20 respect of property or risks in this state,
21 whether or not otherwise determinable, may at the
22 election of the company be determined on the
23 basis of the proportion which premiums written
24 for insurance accepted from companies
Req. No. 1807 Page 9

1 commercially domiciled in Oklahoma this state
2 bears to premiums written for reinsurance
3 accepted from all sources, or alternatively in
4 the proportion which the sum of the direct
5 premiums written for insurance on property or
6 risks in this state by each ceding company from
7 which reinsurance is accepted bears to the sum of
8 the total direct premiums written by each such
9 ceding company for the taxable year.
10 5. The net income or loss remaining after the separate
11 allocation in paragraph 4 of this subsection, being that which is
12 derived from a unitary business enterprise, shall be apportioned to
13 this state on the basis of the arithmetical average of three factors
14 consisting of property, payroll and sales or gross revenue
15 enumerated as subparagraphs a, b and c of this paragraph. Net
16 income or loss as used in this paragraph includes that derived from
17 patent or copyright royalties, purchase discounts, and interest on
18 accounts receivable relating to or arising from a business activity,
19 the income from which is apportioned pursuant to this subsection,
20 including the sale or other disposition of such property and any
21 other property used in the unitary enterprise. Deductions used in
22 computing such net income or loss shall not include taxes based on
23 or measured by income. Provided, for corporations whose property
24 for purposes of the tax imposed by Section 2355 of this title has an
Req. No. 1807 Page 10

1 init ial investment cost equaling or exceeding Two Hundred Million
2 Dollars ($200,000,000.00) and such investment is made on or after
3 July 1, 1997, or for corporations which expand their property or
4 facilities in this state and such expansion has an investment cost
5 equaling or exceeding Two Hundred Million Dollars ($200,000,000.00)
6 over a period not to exceed three (3) years, and such expansion is
7 commenced on or after January 1, 2000, the three factors shall be
8 apportioned with property and payroll, each comprising twenty-five
9 percent (25%) of the apportionment factor and sales comprising fifty
10 percent (50%) of the apportionment factor. The apportionment
11 factors shall be computed as follows:
12 a. The property factor is a fraction, the numerator of
13 which is the average value of the taxpayer’s real and
14 tangible personal property owned or rented and used in
15 this state during the tax period and the denominator
16 of which is the average value of all the taxpayer’s
17 real and tangible personal property everywhere owned
18 or rented and used during the tax period.
19 (1) Property, the income from which is separately
20 allocated in paragraph 4 of this subsection,
21 shall not be included in determining this
22 fraction. The numerator of the fraction shall
23 include a portion of the investment in
24 transportation and other equipment having no
Req. No. 1807 Page 11

1 fixed situs, such as rolling stock, buses, trucks
2 and trailers, including machinery and equipment
3 carried thereon, airplanes, salespersons’
4 automobiles and other similar equipment, in the
5 proportion that miles traveled in Oklahoma this
6 state by such equipment bears to total miles
7 traveled,
8 (2) Property owned by the taxpayer is valued at its
9 original cost. Property rented by the taxpayer
10 is valued at eight times the net annual rental
11 rate. Net annual rental rate is the annual
12 rental rate paid by the taxpayer, less any annual
13 rental rate received by the taxpayer from
14 subrentals,
15 (3) The average value of property shall be determined
16 by averaging the values at the beginning and
17 ending of the tax period but the Oklahoma Tax
18 Commission may require the averaging of monthly
19 values during the tax period if reasonably
20 required to reflect properly the average value of
21 the taxpayer’s property;
22 b. The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of
23 which is the total compensation for services rendered
24 in the state during the tax period, and the
Req. No. 1807 Page 12

1 denominator of which is the total compensation for
2 services rendered everywhere during the tax period.
3 “Compensation”, as used in this subsection, means
4 those paid-for services to the extent related to the
5 unitary business but does not include officers’
6 salaries, wages and other compensation.
7 (1) In the case of a transportation enterprise, the
8 numerator of the fraction shall include a portion
9 of such expenditure in connection with employees
10 operating equipment over a fixed route, such as
11 railroad employees, airline pilots, or bus
12 drivers, in this state only a part of the time,
13 in the proportion that mileage traveled in
14 Oklahoma this state bears to total mileage
15 traveled by such employees,
16 (2) In any case the numerator of the fraction shall
17 include a portion of such expenditures in
18 connection with itinerant employees, such as
19 traveling salespersons, in this state only a part
20 of the time, in the proportion that time spent in
21 Oklahoma this state bears to total time spent in
22 furtherance of the enterprise by such employees;
23 c. The sales factor is a fraction, the numerator of which
24 is the total sales or gross revenue of the taxpayer in
Req. No. 1807 Page 13

1 this state during the tax period, and the denominator
2 of which is the total sales or gross revenue of the
3 taxpayer everywhere during the tax period. “Sales”,
4 as used in this subsection, does not include sales or
5 gross revenue which are separately allocated in
6 paragraph 4 of this subsection.
7 (1) Sales of tangible personal property have a situs
8 in this state if the property is delivered or
9 shipped to a purchaser other than the United
10 States government, within this state regardless
11 of the FOB Freight on Board (FOB) point or other
12 conditions of the sale; or the property is
13 shipped from an office, store, warehouse, factory
14 or other place of storage in this state and (a)
15 the purchaser is the United States government or
16 (b) the taxpayer is not doing business in the
17 state of the destination of the shipment.
18 (2) In the case of a railroad or interurban railway
19 enterprise, the numerator of the fraction shall
20 not be less than the allocation of revenues to
21 this state as shown in its annual report to the
22 Corporation Commission.
23 (3) In the case of an airline, truck or bus
24 enterprise or freight car, tank car, refrigerator
Req. No. 1807 Page 14

1 car or other railroad equipment enterprise, the
2 numerator of the fraction shall include a portion
3 of revenue from interstate transportation in the
4 proportion that interstate mileage traveled in
5 Oklahoma this state bears to total interstate
6 mileage traveled.
7 (4) In the case of an oil, gasoline or gas pipeline
8 enterprise, the numerator of the fraction shall
9 be either the total of traffic units of the
10 enterprise within Oklahoma this state or the
11 revenue allocated to Oklahoma this state based
12 upon miles moved, at the option of the taxpayer,
13 and the denominator of which shall be the total
14 of traffic units of the enterprise or the revenue
15 of the enterprise everywhere as appropriate to
16 the numerator. A “traffic unit” is hereby
17 defined as the transportation for a distance of
18 one (1) mile of one (1) barrel of oil, one (1)
19 gallon of gasoline or one thousand (1,000) cubic
20 feet of natural or casinghead gas, as the case
21 may be.
22 (5) In the case of a telephone or telegraph or other
23 communication enterprise, the numerator of the
24 fraction shall include that portion of the
Req. No. 1807 Page 15

1 interstate revenue as is allocated pursuant to
2 the accounting procedures prescribed by the
3 Federal Communications Commission; provided that
4 in respect to each corporation or business entity
5 required by the Federal Communications Commission
6 to keep its books and records in accordance with
7 a uniform system of accounts prescribed by such
8 Commission, the intrastate net income shall be
9 determined separately in the manner provided by
10 such uniform system of accounts and only the
11 interstate income shall be subject to allocation
12 pursuant to the provisions of this subsection.
13 Provided further, that the gross revenue factors
14 shall be those as are determined pursuant to the
15 accounting procedures prescribed by the Federal
16 Communications Commission.
17 In any case where the apportionment of the three factors
18 prescribed in this paragraph attributes to Oklahoma this state a
19 portion of net income of the enterprise out of all appropriate
20 proportion to the property owned and/or business transacted within
21 this state, because of the fact that one or more of the factors so
22 prescribed are not employed to any appreciable extent in furtherance
23 of the enterprise; or because one or more factors not so prescribed
24 are employed to a considerable extent in furtherance of the
Req. No. 1807 Page 16

1 ente rprise; or because of other reasons, the Tax Commission is
2 empowered to permit, after a showing by taxpayer that an excessive
3 portion of net income has been attributed to Oklahoma this state, or
4 require, when in its judgment an insufficient portion of net income
5 has been attributed to Oklahoma this state, the elimination,
6 substitution, or use of additional factors, or reduction or increase
7 in the weight of such prescribed factors. Provided, however, that
8 any such variance from such prescribed factors which has the effect
9 of increasing the portion of net income attributable to Oklahoma
10 this state must not be inherently arbitrary, and application of the
11 recomputed final apportionment to the net income of the enterprise
12 must attribute to Oklahoma this state only a reasonable portion
13 thereof.
14 6. For calendar years 1997 and 1998, the owner of a new or
15 expanded agricultural commodity processing facility in this state
16 may exclude from Oklahoma taxable income, or in the case of an
17 individual, the Oklahoma adjusted gross income, fifteen percent
18 (15%) of the investment by the owner in the new or expanded
19 agricultural commodity processing facility. For calendar year 1999,
20 and all subsequent years, the percentage, not to exceed fifteen
21 percent (15%), available to the owner of a new or expanded
22 agricultural commodity processing facility in this state claiming
23 the exemption shall be adjusted annually so that the total estimated
24 reduction in tax liability does not exceed One Million Dollars
Req. No. 1807 Page 17

1 ($1, 000,000.00) annually. The Tax Commission shall promulgate rules
2 for determining the percentage of the investment which each eligible
3 taxpayer may exclude. The exclusion provided by this paragraph
4 shall be taken in the taxable year when the investment is made. In
5 the event the total reduction in tax liability authorized by this
6 paragraph exceeds One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) in any
7 calendar year, the Tax Commission shall permit any excess over One
8 Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) and shall factor such excess into
9 the percentage for subsequent years. Any amount of the exemption
10 permitted to be excluded pursuant to the provisions of this
11 paragraph but not used in any year may be carried forward as an
12 exemption from income pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph
13 for a period not exceeding six (6) years following the year in which
14 the investment was originally made.
15 For purposes of this paragraph:
16 a. “Agricultural commodity processing facility” means
17 building buildings, structures, fixtures and
18 improvements used or operated primarily for the
19 processing or production of marketable products from

18 with and to the extent of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
19 amended, 26 U.S.C., Section 172(b)(G) 172(b)(1)(B). However, the
20 amount of the net operating loss carryback shall not exceed the
21 lesser of:
22 a. Sixty Thousand Dollars ($60,000.00), or
23 b. the loss properly shown on Schedule F of the Internal

7 permitted for the tax years in which the federal tax credit pursuant
8 to 26 U.S.C.A., Section 45A, is allowed. For purposes of this
9 paragraph, “qualified wages” means those wages used to calculate the
