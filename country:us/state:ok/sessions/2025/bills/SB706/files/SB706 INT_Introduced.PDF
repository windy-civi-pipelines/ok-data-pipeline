12
13
weighted average daily membership for the school district of the
13
14
preceding school year. Each school district shall submit the
14
15
following data based on the first nine (9) weeks, to be used in the

16
calculation of the average daily membership of the school district:
16

1. Student enrollment by grade level;

21
22
pursuant to subsection D of this section. The State Department of

Except for reductions made due to the assessment of penalties by the
