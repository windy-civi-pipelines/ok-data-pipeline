7 Section 18-200.1), is amended to read as follows:
8 Section 18-200.1. A. Beginning with the 2022-2023 school year,
9 and each school year thereafter, each school district shall have its
10 initial allocation of State Aid calculated based on the state
11 dedicated revenues actually collected during the preceding fiscal
12 year, the adjusted assessed valuation of the preceding year, and the
13 weighted average daily membership for the school district of the
14 preceding school year. Each school district shall submit the
15 following data based on the first nine (9) weeks, to be used in the
16 calculation of the average daily membership of the school district:
17 1. Student enrollment by grade level;
18 2. Pupil category counts; and
19 3. Transportation supplement data.
20 On or before December 30, the State Department of Education
21 shall determine each school district’s current year allocation
22 pursuant to subsection D of this section. The State Department of
23 Education shall complete an audit, using procedures established by

3 December 1 and by January 15 shall notify each school district of
4 the district’s final State Aid allocation for the current school
5 year. The January payment of State Aid and each subsequent payment
6 for the remainder of the school year shall be based on the final
7 State Aid allocation as calculated in subsection D of this section.
8 Except for reductions made due to the assessment of penalties by the
9 State Department of Education according to law, the January payment
10 of State Aid and each subsequent payment for the remainder of the
11 school year shall not decrease by an amount more than the amount
12 that the current chargeable revenue increases for that district.
13 B. The State Department of Education shall retain not less than
14 one and one-half percent (1 1/2%) of the total funds appropriated
15 for financial support of schools, to be used to make midyear
16 adjustments in State Aid and which shall be reflected in the final
17 allocations. If the amount of appropriated funds, including the one
18 and one-half percent (1 1/2%) retained, remaining after January 1 of
19 each year is not sufficient to fully fund the final allocations, the
20 Department shall recalculate each school district’s remaining
21 allocation pursuant to subsection D of this section using the
22 reduced amount of appropriated funds.
23 C. On and after July 1, 1997, the amount of State Aid each
24 district shall receive shall be the sum of the Foundation Aid, the
ENGR. S. B. NO. 706 Page 9

1 Sala ry Incentive Aid, and the Transportation Supplement, as adjusted
2 pursuant to the provisions of subsection G of this section and

4 pupil revenue in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the
5 average per pupil revenue of all districts shall receive any State
6 Aid or Supplement in State Aid.
7 The July calculation of per pupil revenue shall be determined by
8 dividing the district’s second preceding year’s total weighted
9 average daily membership (ADM) into the district’s second preceding
10 year’s total revenues excluding federal revenue, insurance loss
11 payments, reimbursements, recovery of overpayments and refunds,
12 unused reserves, prior expenditures recovered, prior year surpluses,
13 and less the amount of any transfer fees paid in that year.
14 The December calculation of per pupil revenue shall be
15 determined by dividing the district’s preceding year’s total
16 weighted average daily membership (ADM) into the district’s
17 preceding year’s total revenues excluding federal revenue, insurance
18 loss payments, reimbursements, recovery of overpayments and refunds,
19 unused reserves, prior expenditures recovered, prior year surpluses,
20 and less the amount of any transfer fees paid in that year.

22 thereafter, Foundation Aid, the Transportation Supplement, and
23 Salary Incentive Aid shall be calculated as follows:
24
ENGR. S. B. NO. 706 Page 10

2 of the Foundation Program Income from the cost of the Foundation
3 Program and adding to this difference the Transportation Supplement.
4 a. The Foundation Program shall be a district’s higher
5 weighted average daily membership based on the first
6 nine (9) weeks of the current school year or the
7 preceding school year of a school district, as
8 determined by the provisions of subsection A of
9 Section 18-201.1 of this title and paragraphs 1, 2, 3,
10 and 4 of subsection B of Section 18-201.1 of this
11 title, multiplied by the Base Foundation Support
12 Level. However, for the portion of weighted
13 membership derived from nonresident, transferred
14 pupils enrolled in online courses, the Foundation
15 Program shall be a district’s weighted average daily
16 membership of the preceding school year or the first
17 nine (9) weeks of the current school year, whichever
18 is greater, as determined by the provisions of
19 subsection A of Section 18-201.1 of this title and
20 paragraphs 1, 2, 3, and 4 of subsection B of Section

4 preceding fiscal year calculated on a per capita basis
5 on the unit provided for by law for the distribution
6 of each such revenue.

7 data by school sites and by school districts, the administration of
8 the Oklahoma School Testing Program Act, the collection of
9 appropriate and necessary data pursuant to the Oklahoma Educational
10 Indicators Program, determining student enrollment, establishing a
11 student mobility rate, allocation of the State Aid Formula, and

2 for the school year that such ad valorem taxes are calculated in the
3 State Aid Formula, shall be determined by subtracting the net
4 assessed valuation of the property upon which taxes were deemed

13 less than the amount of funds claimed for reimbursement by the
14 school district due to insufficiency of funds as provided in Section

16 assessed valuation for the school year that such ad valorem
17 reimbursement is calculated in the State Aid Formula shall be
18 adjusted accordingly.
19 G. 1. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 18-112.2 of
