A Concurrent Resolution designating April 15 as

thanking military families.
WHEREAS, April is recognized worldwide as the Month of the
Military Child, with special recognition on April 15 as Purple Up!
For Military Kids Day; and
WHEREAS, the Month of the Military Child was established in 1986
by former United States Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger to
honor the sacrifices made by military families and to acknowledge
the vital role military children play within the armed forces
community; and
WHEREAS, military children face unique challenges as a result of
their parents’ incredible service, including frequent relocations,
long separations, and multiple deployments to combat zones, all
while enduring the uncertainty of their parents’ safe return; and
WHEREAS, these children exemplify resilience, courage, and
strength, navigating the hardships of military life with admirable
perseverance and adaptability; and
WHEREAS, the tradition of wearing purple, known as the “purple
suit,” symbolizes unity across all branches of the military—
combining Air Force blue, Army green, Navy blue, Marine red, and

Coast Guard blue to represent a shared commitment to service and
sacrifice; and
WHEREAS, on April 15, wearing purple serves as a visible tribute
to military children, celebrating their important contributions.
