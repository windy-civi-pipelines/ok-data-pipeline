3 is created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:
4 A. A producer operating under an approved battery stewardship
5 plan that collects covered batteries that are not included under the
6 producer's approved plan is entitled to reimbursement from the
7 producer of the collected batteries for reasonable costs incurred in
8 collecting, handling, recycling, or properly disposing of such
9 batteries. A producer may request reimbursement only after the
10 producer has met the collection rate performance goal included in
11 the producer's approved battery stewardship plan. Reimbursement may
12 be requested only for costs actually incurred in the collection,
13 transport, recycling, and other methods proper of disposal of
14 covered batteries identified in the producer's approved battery
15 stewardship plan, and reasonable administrative costs.

17 this subsection may, prior to payment and within thirty (30) days of
18 receiving the request for reimbursement, request an independent
19 audit of the requested reimbursement costs. If the independent
20 audit confirms that the requested reimbursement costs are
21 reasonable, the producer requesting the audit shall pay the cost of
22 the audit and the amount of the reimbursement requested. If the
23 independent audit finds that the reimbursement request, or any
24 portion thereof, was not reasonable, the producer that submitted the
