6 subdivision, the owner of such home shall file with
7 the political subdivision an application for the
8 establishment of such group home in such residential
9 area. The political subdivision shall provide for
10 notice to be given to all affected real property
11 owners. The notice shall contain a legal description

22 fails to comply with the spacing requirements of
23 subsection B of this section.

22 c.
23 b. protection of the health and safety of the residents

2 obligation to comply with the requirements or
3 standards of a political subdivision pertaining to

5 vehicle parking space that generally apply to single-
6 family residences in the zoning district. No
7 requirements for business licenses, gross receipt
8 taxes, environmental impact studies, or clearances may
9 be imposed on such homes if such fees, taxes, or
10 clearances are not imposed on all structures in the
11 zoning district housing a like number of persons. A

18 subdivision in which a group home is, or is to be,
19 located may petition the Department of Human Services
20 to deny an application for a license to operate a
21 group home on the grounds that the operation of such a
22 home would be in violation of the limits established
23 pursuant to the provisions of subparagraph a of
24 paragraph 2 of subsection B of this section, and
Req. No. 12419 Page 5

9 residents of such home and that copies of this list shall be
10 available upon request to any resident of this state and any state
11 agency or political subdivision.
12 SECTION 2. This act shall become effective November 1, 2025.
