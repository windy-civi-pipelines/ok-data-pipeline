16 A. 1. a. A group home is a residential use of property for the
17 purposes of zoning and shall be treated as a permitted
18 use in all residential zones or districts, including
19 all single-family residential zones or districts of

5 the political subdivision an application for the
6 establishment of such group home in such residential
7 area. The political subdivision shall provide for

20 fails to comply with the spacing requirements of
21 subsection B of this section.
22 2. After the initial approval process, the political
23 subdivision shall have the right to require a rezoning application,

8 such time, rules promulgated by the State Board of Health shall
9 terminate.
10 2. For the purposes of safeguarding the health and safety of

8 with similar community-based residences, within one hundred eighty
9 (180) days of the effective date of the Community Residential Living
10 for Persons with Developmental or Physical Disabilities Act, the

17 needs and to further their progress towards
18 independent living,
19 c.
20 b. protection of the health and safety of the residents
21 of group homes. Compliance with these rules shall not

6 be imposed on such homes if such fees, taxes, or
7 clearances are not imposed on all structures in the
8 zoning district housing a like number of persons. A
9 group home shall not be excluded from a single family

15 subdivision in which a group home is, or is to be,
16 located may petition the Department of Human Services
17 to deny an application for a license to operate a
18 group home on the grounds that the operation of such a
19 home would be in violation of the limits established
20 pursuant to the provisions of subparagraph a of
21 paragraph 2 of subsection B of this section, and
22 e.
23 d. fees for licenses or renewal of licenses required by
24 this section.
