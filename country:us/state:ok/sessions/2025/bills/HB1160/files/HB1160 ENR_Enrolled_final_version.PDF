insurer;
2. "Association" means the Oklahoma Property and Casualty

title;
3. "Assumed claims transaction" means:
a. policy obligations that have been assumed by the

may be a claimant;
5. "Commissioner" means the Insurance Commissioner of Oklahoma;

SECTION 4. AMENDATORY 36 O.S. 2021, Section 2007, is
amended to read as follows:
Section 2007. A. The Oklahoma Property and Casualty Insurance
Guaranty Association shall:
1. Be obligated to pay the covered claims existing prior to the
determination of insolvency if the claims arise within thirty (30)
days after the determination of insolvency, or before the policy
expiration date if less than thirty (30) days after the
determination, or before the insured replaces the policy or causes
its cancellation, if the insured does so within thirty (30) days of
the determination. The obligation shall be satisfied by paying to
the claimant an amount as follows:
a. the full amount of a covered claim for benefits under
a workers' compensation insurance coverage,
b. an amount not exceeding Ten Thousand Dollars
($10,000.00) per policy for a covered claim for the
return of unearned premium, and
c. an amount not exceeding One Hundred Fifty Thousand
Dollars ($150,000.00) per claimant for all other
covered claims except for claims relating to a
cybersecurity insurance policy, and
d. in no event shall the Association be obligated to pay
an amount in excess of Three Hundred Thousand Dollars
($300,000.00) for all first- and third-party claims
under a policy or endorsement providing, or that is
found to provide, cybersecurity insurance coverage and
arising out of or related to a single insured event,
regardless of the number of claims made or the number
of claimants.
In no event shall the Association be obligated to pay a claimant
an amount in excess of the obligation of the insolvent insurer under
the policy or coverage from which the claim arises or in excess of
the limits of the obligation of the Association existing on the date
on which the order of liquidation is filed with the court clerk;
ENR. H. B. NO. 1160 Page 9

2. Any obligation of the association Association to defend an
insured shall cease upon the payment or tender by the association
Association of an amount equal to the lesser of the covered claim
obligation limit of the association Association or the applicable
policy limit;
3. As payor of last resort, have all rights, duties and
obligations of the insolvent insurer as if the insurer had not
become insolvent including, but not limited to, the right to pursue
and retain salvage and subrogation recoverable on covered claim
obligations to the extent paid by the association Association. The
association Association shall not be deemed the insolvent insurer
for the purpose of conferring jurisdiction;
4. Allocate claims paid and expenses incurred among the three
accounts set out in Section 2005 of this title separately, and
assess member insurers separately for each account amounts necessary
to pay the obligations of the Association under this section
subsequent to a member insurer becoming an insolvent insurer, the
expenses of handling covered claims subsequent to an insolvency, and
other expenses authorized by the Oklahoma Property and Casualty
Insurance Guaranty Association Act, Sections 2001 through 2020 of
this title and Sections 2020.1 and 2020.2 of this title. The
assessments of each member insurer shall be in the proportion that
the net direct written premiums of the member insurer for the
calendar year preceding the assessment on the kinds of insurance in
the account bear to the net direct written premiums of all
participating insurers for the calendar year preceding the
assessment on the kinds of insurance in the account. Each member
insurer shall be notified in writing of the assessment not later
than thirty (30) days before it is due. No member insurer may be
assessed in any year an amount greater than two percent (2%) of the
net direct written premiums of that member or one percent (1%) of
that surplus of the member insurer as regards policyholders for the
calendar year preceding the assessment on the kinds of insurance in
the account, whichever is less. If the maximum assessment, together
with the other assets of the Association, does not provide in any
one (1) year in any account an amount sufficient to make all
necessary payments from that account, the funds available may be
prorated and the unpaid portion shall be paid as soon thereafter as
funds become available. The Association shall pay claims in any
order which it deems reasonable, including the payment of claims as
the claims are received from the claimants or in groups or
categories of claims. The Association may exempt or defer, in whole
or in part, the assessment of any member insurer, if the assessment
ENR. H. B. NO. 1160 Page 10

would cause the financial statement of the member insurer to reflect
amounts of capital or surplus less than the minimum amounts required
for a certificate of authority by any jurisdiction in which the
member insurer is authorized to transact insurance. During the
period of deferment, no dividends shall be paid to shareholders or
policyholders. Deferred assessments shall be paid when the payments
will not reduce capital or surplus below required minimums. The
payments may be refunded to those companies receiving larger
assessments by virtue of the deferment, or, at the election of any
company credited against future assessments. Each member insurer
serving as a servicing facility may set off against any assessment
authorized payments made on covered claims and expenses incurred in
the payment of covered claims by a member insurer if they are
chargeable to the account for which the assessment is made;
5. Investigate claims brought against the Association and
adjust, compromise, settle and pay covered claims to the extent of
the obligation of the Association and deny all other claims. The
Association shall pay claims in any order that it may deem
reasonable, including, but not limited to, the payment of claims as
they are received from claimants or in groups of categories of
claims. The Association shall have the right to select and to
direct legal counsel under liability insurance policies for the
defense of covered claims;
6. Notify claimants in this state as deemed necessary by the
Commissioner and upon the request of the Commissioner, to the extent
records are available to the Association. Notification may include,
but shall not be limited to, a legal posting on the website of the
Association;
7. a. Handle claims through employees or through one or more
insurers or other persons designated as servicing
facilities. Designation of a servicing facility is
subject to approval of the Commissioner, but such
designation may be declined by a member insurer.
b. The Association shall have the right to review and
contest as set forth in this paragraph, settlements,
releases, compromises, waivers and judgments to which
the insolvent insurer or its insureds were parties
prior to the entry of the order of liquidation. In an
action to enforce settlements, releases and judgments
to which the insolvent insurer or its insureds were
parties prior to the entry of the order of
ENR. H. B. NO. 1160 Page 11

liquidation, the Association shall have the right to
assert the following defenses:
(1) the Association shall not be bound by a
settlement, release, compromise or waiver
executed by an insured or the insurer, or any
judgment entered against the insured or the
insurer by consent or through a failure to
exhaust all appeals, if the settlement, release,
compromise waiver or judgment was:
(a) executed or entered within one hundred
twenty (120) days prior to the entry of an
order of liquidation, and the insured or the
insurer did not use reasonable care in
entering into the settlement, release,
compromise, waiver or judgment, or did not
pursue all reasonable appeals of an adverse
judgment, or
(b) executed by or taken against an insured or
the insurer based on default, fraud,
collusion or the failure of the insurer to
defend,
(2) if a court of competent jurisdiction finds that
the Association is not bound by a settlement,
release, compromise, waiver or judgment for the
releases provided for in division (1) of
subparagraph b of this paragraph, the settlement,
release, compromise, waiver or judgment shall be
set aside and the Association shall be permitted
to defend any covered claim on the merits. The
settlement, release, compromise, waiver or
judgment shall not be considered as evidence of
liability in connection with any claim brought
against the Association or any other party
pursuant to the Oklahoma Property and Casualty
Insurance Guaranty Association Act, and
(3) the Association shall have the right to assert
any statutory defenses or rights of offset
against any settlement, release, compromise or
waiver executed by an insured or the insurer, or
ENR. H. B. NO. 1160 Page 12

any judgment taken against the insured or the
insurer.
c. As to any covered claims arising from a judgment under
any decision, verdict or finding based on the default
of the insolvent insurer or its failure to defend, the
Association, either on its own behalf or on behalf of
an insured, may apply to have the judgment, order,
decision, verdict or finding set aside by the same
court or administrator that entered the judgment,
claim, decision, verdict or finding and shall be
permitted to defend on the merits;
8. Reimburse each servicing facility for obligations of the
Association paid by the facility and for reasonable expenses
incurred by the facility while handling claims on behalf of the
Association and pay the other expenses of the Association authorized
by the Oklahoma Property and Casualty Insurance Guaranty Association
Act;
9. Have standing to appear before any court of this state which
has jurisdiction over an impaired or insolvent insurer for whom the
Association is or may become obligated pursuant to the provisions of
the Oklahoma Property and Casualty Insurance Guaranty Association
Act. Standing shall extend to all matters germane to the powers and
duties of the Association including, but not limited to, proposals
for rehabilitation, acquisition, merger, reinsuring, or guaranteeing
the covered policies of the impaired or insolvent insurer, and the
determination of covered policies and contractual obligations of the
impaired or insolvent insurer; and
10. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Oklahoma
Property and Casualty Insurance Guaranty Association Act, an
insurance policy issued by a member insurer and later allocated,
transferred, assumed by or otherwise made the sole responsibility of
another insurer pursuant to any provision of law providing for the
division of an insurance company, or the statutory assumption or
transfer of designated policies under which there is no remaining
obligation to the transferring entity, shall be considered to have
been issued by a member insurer which is an insolvent insurer for
the purposes of this Act act in the event that the insurer to which
the policy has been allocated, transferred, assumed or otherwise
made the sole responsibility of is placed in liquidation. An
insurance policy that was issued by an insurer who is not a member
insurer and subsequently allocated, transferred, assumed by or
ENR. H. B. NO. 1160 Page 13

otherwise made the sole responsibility of a member insurer under any
provision of law providing for the division of an insurance company
shall not be considered to have been issued by a member insurer
pursuant to this Act act.

year the board of directors finds that the assets of the Association
exceed the liabilities as estimated by the board of directors for
the coming year;
6. Lend monies to an insurer declared to be impaired by the
Commissioner. The Association, with approval of the Commissioner,
shall approve the amount, length and terms of the loan. "Impaired
Insurer" for purposes of this section shall mean an insurer
potentially unable to fulfill its contractual obligations, but shall
not mean an insolvent insurer;
7. Perform other acts as are necessary or proper to effectuate
the purpose of the Oklahoma Property and Casualty Insurance Guaranty
Association Act;
8. Intervene as a party in interest in any supervision,
conservation, liquidation, rehabilitation, impairment or
receivership in which policyholders' interests and interests of the
Association may be or are affected; and
ENR. H. B. NO. 1160 Page 14

9. Be designated or may contract as a servicing facility for
any entity which may be recommended by the board of directors of the
Association and shall be approved by the Commissioner.
SECTION 5. AMENDATORY 36 O.S. 2021, Section 2009, is
amended to read as follows:
Section 2009. A. The Commissioner shall:
1. Notify the Oklahoma Property and Casualty Insurance Guaranty
Association Executive Director of the existence of an insolvent
insurer as soon as possible but not later than three (3) days after

jurisdiction; and

a high net worth insured; and
2. The Association shall have the right to recover from a high
net worth insured all amounts paid by the association Association to

action necessary to collect the full amount to the Association's
reimbursement under this section.
C. The Association shall not be obligated to pay any claim that
would otherwise be a covered claim that is an obligation to or on

the claimant at the time specified by the applicable law of that
state, and which association has denied coverage to that claimant on

D. The Association shall establish reasonable procedures for

is created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:
No person, including an insurer, insurance producer, or
affiliate of an insurer, shall publish, disseminate, circulate, or
place before the public, or cause, directly or indirectly, to be
published, disseminated, circulated or placed before the public, in
ENR. H. B. NO. 1160 Page 17

any newspaper, magazine or other publication, or in the form of a
notice, circular, pamphlet, letter or poster, or over any radio
station or television station, or in any other way, any
advertisement, which uses the existence of the Insurance Guaranty
Association of this state for the purpose of sales, solicitation, or
inducement to purchase any form of insurance covered by the Oklahoma
Property and Casualty Insurance Guaranty Association law. However,
