6 this title and Sections 2020.1 and 2020.2 of this title. The
7 assessments of each member insurer shall be in the proportion that

10 the account bear to the net direct written premiums of all
11 participating insurers for the calendar year preceding the
12 assessment on the kinds of insurance in the account. Each member
13 insurer shall be notified in writing of the assessment not later
14 than thirty (30) days before it is due. No member insurer may be
15 assessed in any year an amount greater than two percent (2%) of the
16 net direct written premiums of that member or one percent (1%) of
17 that surplus of the member insurer as regards policyholders for the
18 calendar year preceding the assessment on the kinds of insurance in

8 member insurer is authorized to transact insurance. During the
9 period of deferment, no dividends shall be paid to shareholders or
10 policyholders. Deferred assessments shall be paid when the payments
11 will not reduce capital or surplus below required minimums. The
12 payments may be refunded to those companies receiving larger
13 assessments by virtue of the deferment, or, at the election of any

11 participating insurers for the calendar year preceding the
12 assessment on the kinds of insurance in the account. Each member
13 insurer shall be notified in writing of the assessment not later
14 than thirty (30) days before it is due. No member insurer may be
15 assessed in any year an amount greater than two percent (2%) of the
16 net direct written premiums of that member or one percent (1%) of
17 that surplus of the member insurer as regards policyholders for the
18 calendar year preceding the assessment on the kinds of insurance in
19 the account, whichever is less. If the maximum assessment, together
20 with the other assets of the Association, does not provide in any
21 one (1) year in any account an amount sufficient to make all
22 necessary payments from that account, the funds available may be
23 prorated and the unpaid portion shall be paid as soon thereafter as
24 funds become available. The Association shall pay claims in any

5 would cause the financial statement of the member insurer to reflect
6 amounts of capital or surplus less than the minimum amounts required
7 for a certificate of authority by any jurisdiction in which the
8 member insurer is authorized to transact insurance. During the
9 period of deferment, no dividends shall be paid to shareholders or
10 policyholders. Deferred assessments shall be paid when the payments
11 will not reduce capital or surplus below required minimums. The
12 payments may be refunded to those companies receiving larger
13 assessments by virtue of the deferment, or, at the election of any
14 company credited against future assessments. Each member insurer
15 serving as a servicing facility may set off against any assessment
16 authorized payments made on covered claims and expenses incurred in
17 the payment of covered claims by a member insurer if they are
18 chargeable to the account for which the assessment is made;
19 5. Investigate claims brought against the Association and
20 adjust, compromise, settle and pay covered claims to the extent of
21 the obligation of the Association and deny all other claims. The
22 Association shall pay claims in any order that it may deem

24 they are received from claimants or in groups of categories of

19 action to enforce settlements, releases and judgments
20 to which the insolvent insurer or its insureds were
21 parties prior to the entry of the order of
22 liquidation, the Association shall have the right to
23 assert the following defenses:

10 order of liquidation, and the insured or the
11 insurer did not use reasonable care in
12 entering into the settlement, release,
13 compromise, waiver or judgment, or did not
14 pursue all reasonable appeals of an adverse
15 judgment, or
16 (b) executed by or taken against an insured or
17 the insurer based on default, fraud,
18 collusion or the failure of the insurer to
19 defend,
