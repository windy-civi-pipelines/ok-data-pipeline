24 an amount in excess of the obligation of the insolvent insurer under
Req. No. 10794 Page 13

14 for the purpose of conferring jurisdiction;
15 4. Allocate claims paid and expenses incurred among the three
16 accounts set out in Section 2005 of this title separately, and

4 participating insurers for the calendar year preceding the
5 assessment on the kinds of insurance in the account. Each member
6 insurer shall be notified in writing of the assessment not later
7 than thirty (30) days before it is due. No member insurer may be
8 assessed in any year an amount greater than two percent (2%) of the

10 that surplus of the member insurer as regards policyholders for the
11 calendar year preceding the assessment on the kinds of insurance in

4 will not reduce capital or surplus below required minimums. The

7 company credited against future assessments. Each member insurer

11 chargeable to the account for which the assessment is made;
12 5. Investigate claims brought against the Association and

14 to which the insolvent insurer or its insureds were
15 parties prior to the entry of the order of
16 liquidation, the Association shall have the right to
17 assert the following defenses:

15 release, compromise, waiver or judgment for the
16 releases provided for in division (1) of
17 subparagraph b of this paragraph, the settlement,
18 release, compromise, waiver or judgment shall be
19 set aside and the Association shall be permitted

21 reasonable attorney fees in contesting the claim.
