8 and transmission process of the utility or exceed comparable
9 industry standards.

2 ownership of property which result from that wildland fire. A
3 person liable under this subsection shall be liable regardless of
4 whether the fire begins on federal, tribal, state-owned, or private
5 land.
6 B. In any civil action or other legal proceeding seeking to
7 recover injuries arising from the ownership of property which
8 resulted from a wildland fire, an electric utility shall not be
9 considered to have negligently caused a wildland fire if:
10 1. An electrical wildland fire protection plan of the electric
11 utility identified and sought to mitigate conditions which may have
12 caused or contributed to the cause of the wildland fire or fires;
13 2. For the area of origin of the wildland fire, the electric
14 utility has undertaken the fire mitigation work identified in the
15 electrical wildland fire protection plan, including:

9 section to recover injuries arising from the ownership of property
10 which resulted from the wildland fire.

12 of property from a wildland fire, including loss of vegetation,
13 shall be the lesser of:
14 a. the cost to restore the real property to the condition
15 it was in prior to the wildland fire, or
16 b. the difference between:
17 (1) the fair market value of the real property before
18 the wildland fire, and
19 (2) the fair market value of the real property after
20 the wildland fire.

22 protection plan shall not be considered in any award for punitive
23 damages against an electric utility.
