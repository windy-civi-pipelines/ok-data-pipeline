6 Education shall adopt and implement a four-year adjusted cohort
7 graduation rate and an extended-year adjusted cohort graduation
8 rate. The Board shall utilize and report the four-year adjusted
9 cohort graduation rate and the extended-year adjusted cohort
10 graduation rate at the secondary school site, the school district

17 indicator for the academic performance data calculation beginning

19 assessments administered in the 2011-2012 school year. The Board
20 shall use the four-year adjusted cohort graduation rate for
