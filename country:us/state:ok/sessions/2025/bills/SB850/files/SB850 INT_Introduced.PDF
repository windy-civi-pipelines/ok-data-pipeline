17
18
a. “[I]t is religion and morality alone which can
18
19
establish the principles upon which freedom can
19
20
securely stand. [R]eligion and virtue are the only
20
21
foundations...of republicanism and of all free
21
22
governments. Our Constitution was made only for a
22
23
moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate
23
24
24
Req. No. 405 Page 2

to the government of any other,” John Adams, signer of
1
2
the Declaration of Independence,
2
3
b. “[R]eligion and good morals are the only solid
3
4
foundations of public liberty and happiness. While
4
5
the people are virtuous, they cannot be subdued; but
5
6
when once they lose their virtue, they will be ready
6
7
to surrender their liberties to the first external or
7
8
internal invader,” Samuel Adams, signer of the
8
9
Declaration of Independence,
9
10
c. “Without morals a republic cannot subsist any length
10
11
of time; they therefore who are decrying the Christian
11
12
religion (whose morality is so sublime and pure)...are
12
13
undermining the solid foundation of morals– the best
13
14
security for the duration of free governments,”
14
15
Charles Carroll, signer of the Declaration of
15
16
Independence,
16
17
d. “[T]he cultivation of the religious sentiment
17
18
represses licentiousness...inspires respect for law
18
19
and order, and gives strength to the whole social
19
20
fabric. Moral habits...cannot safely be trusted on
20
21
any other foundation than religious principle, nor any
21
22
government be secure which is not supported by moral
22
23
habits.... Whatever makes men good Christians, makes
23
24
them good citizens,” Daniel Webster,
24
Req. No. 405 Page 3

e. “Republican government loses half of its value where
1
2
the moral and social duties are...negligently
2
3
practiced. To exterminate our popular vices is a work
3
4
of far more importance to the character and happiness
4
5
of our citizens, than any other improvements in our
5
6
system of education. [T]he moral principles and
6
7
precepts contained in the Scriptures ought to form the
7
8
basis of all our civil constitutions and laws.... All
8
9
the miseries and evils which men suffer from vice,
9
10
crime, ambition, injustice, oppression, slavery and
10
11
war, proceed from their despising or neglecting the
11
12
precepts contained in the Bible,” Noah Webster,
12
13
f. “We have no government armed with power capable of
13
14
contending with human passions unbridled by morality
14
15
and religion...Our Constitution was made only for a
15
16
moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate
16
17
to the government of any other,” John Adams, signer of
17
18
the Declaration of Independence,
18
19
g. "While we are zealously performing the duties of good
19
20
citizens and soldiers, we certainly ought not to be
20
21
inattentive to the higher duties of religion. To the
21
22
distinguished character of Patriot, it should be our
22
23
highest glory to add the more distinguished character
23
24
of Christian," President George Washington,

h. "The general Principles, on which the Fathers achieved
1
2
independence, were the only Principles in which that
2
3
beautiful Assembly of young Gentlemen could Unite, and
3
4
these Principles only could be intended by them in
4
5
their address, or by me in my answer. And what were
5
6
these general Principles? I answer, the general
6
7
Principles of Christianity, in which all these Sects
7
8
were United: And the general Principles of English and
8
9
American Liberty...Now I will avow, that I then
9
10
believe, and now believe, that those general
10
11
Principles of Christianity, are as eternal and
11
12
immutable, as the Existence and Attributes of God; and
12
13
that those Principles of Liberty, are as unalterable
13
14
as human Nature and our terrestrial, mundane System,"
14
15
John Adams, signer of the Declaration of Independence,
15
16
i. "God who gave us life gave us liberty. And can the
16
17
liberties of a nation be thought secure when we have
17
18
removed their only firm basis, a conviction in the
18
19
minds of the people that these liberties are of the
19
20
Gift of God? That they are not to be violated but
20
21
with His wrath? Indeed, I tremble for my country when
21
22
I reflect that God is just; that His justice cannot
22
23
sleep forever..." Thomas Jefferson, Notes on the State
23
24
of Virginia,

j. "It cannot be emphasized too strongly or too often
1
2
that this great nation was founded, not by
2
3
religionists, but by Christians; not on religions, but
3
4
on the gospel of Jesus Christ. For this very reason
4
5
peoples of other faiths have been afforded asylum,
5
6
prosperity, and freedom of worship here," Patrick
6
7
Henry, The Trumpet Voice of Freedom: Patrick Henry of
7
8
Virginia,
8
9
k. "Providence has given to our people the choice of
9
10
their ruler, and it is the duty, as well as the
10
11
privilege and interest of our Christian nation to
11
12
select and prefer Christians for their rulers," John
12
13
Jay,
13
14
l. “[T]he only means of establishing and perpetuating our
14
15
republican forms of government is the universal
15
16
education of our youth in the principles of
16
17
Christianity by means of the Bible,” Dr. Benjamin
17
18
Rush,
18
19
m. “The great enemy of the salvation of man, in my
19
20
opinion, never invented a more effective means of
20
21
limiting Christianity from the world than by
21
22
persuading mankind that it was improper to read the
22
23
Bible at schools,” Dr. Benjamin Rush, and

n. “One of the beautiful boasts of our municipal
1
2
jurisprudence is that Christianity is a part of the
2
3
Common Law. There never has been a period in which
3
4
the Common Law did not recognize Christianity as lying
4
5
at its foundations. I verily believe that
5
6
Christianity is necessary to support a civil society
6
7
and shall ever attend to its institutions and
7
8
acknowledge its precepts as the pure and natural
8
9
sources of private and social happiness,” Joseph
9
10
Story.

11
B. The State Textbook Committee, when adopting textbooks, shall
11
12
incorporate the provisions of subsection A of this section into the
12
13
criteria used to evaluate United States history and Oklahoma history
13
14
textbooks. Any United States history or Oklahoma history textbook
14
15
on the state adopted textbook list shall conform to the purposes of
15
16
this section. The State Textbook Committee shall ensure that all
16
17
social studies textbooks and supplementary materials selected to be
17
18
purchased with state funds for use in Oklahoma classrooms reflect
18
19
the racial, ethnic, religious, and cultural diversity of the United
19
20
States.
20
21
C. It is the intent of the Legislature that a portion of the
21
22
state funds appropriated for professional development in local
22
23
school districts be used for workshops, seminars, guest lecturers,
23
24
and other methods which further the purposes of this section.
