8 to promote wellness, resilience, recovery, self-advocacy,
9 development of supports, and maintenance of community living skills.
10 COTs can work effectively alongside mobile crisis teams to prevent
11 crisis and provide wraparound supports to those in need. Some rural

14 for follow-up care;

16 health crisis developed in response to the need for local adaptation

20 situations involving unmet behavioral health needs;
21 15. "Crisis stabilization services" reflect a range of models
22 and care to support individuals through emergent and urgent
23 behavioral health needs. Crisis stabilization services involve

6 expected to have the capacity to determine if referral to a crisis
7 hotline or more intensive intervention is warranted. They are
8 sometimes referred to as helplines. Emotional support lines are
9 recognized for providing services such as active, empathetic
10 listening, safety planning, rapport building, and crisis support and
