2 health crisis services are for anyone, anywhere, and at any time and
3 can be provided in a variety of settings, including via text or
4 telephone, face-to-face at an individual's home, or in the
5 community;
6 9. "Behavioral health crisis system" is an organized set of
7 structures, processes, and services in place to meet all types of
8 urgent and emerging mental health and substance use needs in a
9 defined population or community, effectively and efficiently.
10 Essential elements of a behavioral health crisis system include 988

Req. No. 12762 Page 4

9 crisis services. Instead, through outreach and engagement, COTs aim
10 to promote wellness, resilience, recovery, self-advocacy,
11 development of supports, and maintenance of community living skills.
12 COTs can work effectively alongside mobile crisis teams to prevent
13 crisis and provide wraparound supports to those in need. Some rural
14 and under-resourced communities have created teams with dual roles
15 of mobile crisis services and COTs. COTs can be especially helpful
16 for follow-up care;

18 health crisis developed in response to the need for local adaptation

22 situations involving unmet behavioral health needs;
23 15. "Crisis stabilization services" reflect a range of models
24 and care to support individuals through emergent and urgent
Req. No. 12762 Page 6
1 beha vioral health needs. Crisis stabilization services involve

3 to care and stabilization for adults and youth in crisis. Crisis
4 stabilization services are delivered across a continuum of care that
5 includes no barrier, low barrier, and referral-based services;
6 16. "Emotional support lines" focus on providing connection and
7 wellness promotion. They are not hotlines; however, they are still
8 expected to have the capacity to determine if referral to a crisis
9 hotline or more intensive intervention is warranted. They are
10 sometimes referred to as helplines. Emotional support lines are
11 recognized for providing services such as active, empathetic
12 listening, safety planning, rapport building, and crisis support and
13 prevention planning. Prominent examples include Substance Abuse and
14 Mental Health Services Administration National Helpline, the Alcohol
15 and Drug Helpline, and the Alzheimer's Association 24/7 Helpline;

17 and international communications by radio, television, wire,
18 satellite, and cable in all fifty (50) states, the District of

10 agency and employee responsible for enforcing laws, maintaining
11 public order, and managing public safety;

14 use disorders, treatment, and recovery gained through direct
15 involvement as an individual with past or current mental health or
16 substance use challenges;
17 21. "Mobile crisis team" means a multidisciplinary behavioral
18 health team that includes at least one behavioral health care
19 professional who is capable of conducting an assessment of the
20 individual, in accordance with the professional's permitted scope of
21 practice under state law, and other professionals or
22 paraprofessionals with appropriate expertise in behavioral health or

13 a. topically focused to a specific type of need or
14 stressor,

12 local crisis centers that provide free and confidential emotional
13 support to people in suicidal crisis, behavioral health crisis, or

23 situations, or events that may negatively impact an individual's
24 ability to function within his or her current family or caregiver
Req. No. 12762 Page 3

1 and living situation, school, workplace, or community. Behavioral
2 health crisis services are for anyone, anywhere, and at any time and
3 can be provided in a variety of settings, including via text or
4 telephone, face-to-face at an individual's home, or in the
5 community;
6 9. "Behavioral health crisis system" is an organized set of
7 structures, processes, and services in place to meet all types of
8 urgent and emerging mental health and substance use needs in a
9 defined population or community, effectively and efficiently.
10 Essential elements of a behavioral health crisis system include 988
11 crisis lines that accept all calls and texts, and provide support
12 and referrals based on the needs of the individual or family member

20 c. ensure safety and security for staff and those in
21 crisis, and
22 d. involve collaboration with law enforcement and
23 emergency medical services;
24
Req. No. 12762 Page 4

1 10. "Behavioral health equity" is the right to access high-
2 quality, affordable behavioral health care services and support,

7 a. individuals from diverse racial and ethnic
8 backgrounds, including Black, Latino, Indigenous,
9 Native American, Asian American, and Pacific Islander
10 communities,

15 e. residents of rural or remote areas, and
16 f. those experiencing systemic inequities or barriers due
17 to persistent poverty, discrimination, or inequality;

19 that offers safe, voluntary, and time-limited services and supports

22 more intensive crisis services;
23 12. "Community Mental Health Centers and Certified Community
24 Behavioral Health Clinics" are facilities as defined under Section

6 communities and community members to support a variety of needs of
7 individuals including behavioral health, physical care, housing,
8 benefits, education, and employment. COTs do not provide on-demand
9 crisis services. Instead, through outreach and engagement, COTs aim
10 to promote wellness, resilience, recovery, self-advocacy,
11 development of supports, and maintenance of community living skills.
12 COTs can work effectively alongside mobile crisis teams to prevent
13 crisis and provide wraparound supports to those in need. Some rural
14 and under-resourced communities have created teams with dual roles
15 of mobile crisis services and COTs. COTs can be especially helpful
16 for follow-up care;

18 health crisis developed in response to the need for local adaptation

21 effective way to respond to behavioral health crises and other
22 situations involving unmet behavioral health needs;
23 15. "Crisis stabilization services" reflect a range of models
24 and care to support individuals through emergent and urgent
Req. No. 12762 Page 6

1 beha vioral health needs. Crisis stabilization services involve
2 facility-, home-, and community-based services that provide access
3 to care and stabilization for adults and youth in crisis. Crisis
4 stabilization services are delivered across a continuum of care that
5 includes no barrier, low barrier, and referral-based services;
6 16. "Emotional support lines" focus on providing connection and
7 wellness promotion. They are not hotlines; however, they are still
8 expected to have the capacity to determine if referral to a crisis
9 hotline or more intensive intervention is warranted. They are
10 sometimes referred to as helplines. Emotional support lines are
11 recognized for providing services such as active, empathetic
12 listening, safety planning, rapport building, and crisis support and
13 prevention planning. Prominent examples include Substance Abuse and
14 Mental Health Services Administration National Helpline, the Alcohol
15 and Drug Helpline, and the Alzheimer's Association 24/7 Helpline;
16 17. "Federal Communications Commission" regulates interstate
17 and international communications by radio, television, wire,
18 satellite, and cable in all fifty (50) states, the District of
19 Columbia and U.S. territories. An independent U.S. government
20 agency overseen by Congress, the Commission is the federal agency
21 responsible for implementing and enforcing America's communications
22 law and regulations;
23 18. "Health insurance" means any individual or group hospital
24 or medical-expense-incurred policy or health care benefits plan or

6 medical payment or personal injury coverage in a motor vehicle
7 policy, coverage issued as a supplement to liability insurance, a
8 disability policy or workers' compensation;
9 19. "Law enforcement" describes a type of first-responder
10 agency and employee responsible for enforcing laws, maintaining
11 public order, and managing public safety;
12 20. "Lived experience" is personal knowledge about mental
13 health, substance use, or co-occurring mental health and substance
14 use disorders, treatment, and recovery gained through direct
15 involvement as an individual with past or current mental health or
16 substance use challenges;
17 21. "Mobile crisis team" means a multidisciplinary behavioral
18 health team that includes at least one behavioral health care
19 professional who is capable of conducting an assessment of the
20 individual, in accordance with the professional's permitted scope of
21 practice under state law, and other professionals or
22 paraprofessionals with appropriate expertise in behavioral health or
23 mental health crisis response, including nurses, social workers,

8 text, and chat services that are not part of the 988 Lifeline
9 network but that also provide support to people experiencing
10 emotional distress or to third-party callers who are concerned about
11 another person. These hotlines typically fall into one or more of
12 the following categories:
13 a. topically focused to a specific type of need or
14 stressor,
15 b. focused on providing services to a specific
16 population, including but not limited to, a geographic
17 catchment area, and
18 c. targets the needs of individuals experiencing the
19 types of emotional distress that are similar in scope
20 to the 988 Lifeline, but are not connected to the 988
21 Lifeline;
22 23. "Peer-operated warmlines" provide ongoing phone, text, or
23 chat support by an individual with lived experience. Calls are
24 answered by trained peers who have lived experience with the type of
Req. No. 12762 Page 9

1 ment al health support the line is intended to provide. Peer-

9 faith.
