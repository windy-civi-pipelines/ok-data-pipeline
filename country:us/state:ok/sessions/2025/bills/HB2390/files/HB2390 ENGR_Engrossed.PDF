9 or a sale is conducted, or the property is otherwise disposed of to
10 satisfy the lien.
11 C. A facility or unit owner may charge a tenant a reasonable
12 late fee for each period that the tenant does not pay rent due under
13 the rental agreement. The amount of the late fee and the conditions
14 for imposing such a fee shall be stated in the rental agreement or
15 in an addendum to the agreement. For purposes of this subsection, a
16 late fee not to exceed the greater of Twenty Dollars ($20.00) or
17 twenty percent (20%) of unpaid rent is considered reasonable.
18 D. The rental agreement shall contain a provision directing the

20 that is or will be stored in a self-service storage facility.
21 E. If the personal property is a vehicle, watercraft or trailer
22 and rent and other charges remain unpaid the occupant is in default
