State Agency. As used in this Act, “Agency” and “State Agency”
1
2
shall have the same meaning as the term pursuant to Section 415.12
2
3
of Title 74 of the Oklahoma Statues to include every Agency, Board,
3
4
Commission, Trust, and entity of government of the State of Oklahoma
4

6
7
Commission, Trust, or other entity of State Government.
7
8
B. No later than December 1, 2025, LOFT shall use the full list
8
9
of Agencies developed under Subsection A of this section to develop
9
10
a tiered categorization structure for all agencies to implement a
10
11
staggered plan for agency review using zero-based budgeting.
11
12
C. The tiered categorization shall consist of a minimum of
12
13
three tiers in which to classify each agency. LOFT shall separate
13
14
the agencies into tiered categories with the higher tiers for
14
15
agencies with larger budgets, more employees, a greater statutory
15
16
footprint, more licenses, and more administrative rules.
16
17
The Tiered categorization for each state agency shall be created
17
18
by taking into consideration the following:
18
19

Section 4:
1. The size of the current annual budget of the agency from all
19
20
revenue sources including state appropriations, federal funds,
20
21
grants, gifts, etc;

7

Section 10:
1. Higher tiered agencies shall be up for review no fewer than
7
8
every 4 and no more than every 6 years. Lower tiered agencies shall
8
9
be up for review no fewer than every 2 or no more than every 4 years
9
10
on a standard system.
10
11

Section 11:
2. The staggered plan shall be created so that all agencies
11
12
will rotate being up for review over a maximum six year period from
12
13
first implementation.
13
14

Section 12:
3. The staggered plan shall take into consideration the
14
15
currently scheduled sunset of any agency so that the agency is
15
16
reviewed using zero-based budgeting the year before it is up for
16
17
sunset extension.
17
18

Section 13:
4. The staggered plan shall include a cross section of agencies
18
19
from each tier so that each year will have as similar of a
19
20
distribution as possible of the items listed under paragraph B so
20
21
that no one year has an exceedingly higher cumulative amount of
21
22
budget, statutes, rules, employees, or other items to be reviewed
22
23
when all agencies up for review that year than any other year on the
23
24
staggered plan.

July 1st LOFT will begin evaluating each agency up for review that
2
3
year in order to complete the review and issue a report by December
3
4
1st of that year for Legislative consideration during the next
4

collaborative process between LOFT, an agency, the Governor’s
15
16
office, the Legislature, and agency program staff. LOFT analysts
16
17
will meet with the agency staff as needed to review and obtain any
17
18
relevant information to perform a thorough analysis.
18
19
C. The zero-based budgeting analysis process consists of four
19
20
main steps:
20
21

Section 16:
1. Identify and Evaluate Key Activities
21
22
LOFT analysts will initiate the process by gathering information
22
23
from the agency and compiling their research on the programs and the
23
24
key activities of the agency. In collaboration with the agency,
24
Req. No. 1413 Page 4
1
LOFT analysts will work to ensure an adequate understanding of the
1
2
program and its activities. Agencies shall discuss the program’s key
2
3
activities and explain why the program and its activities are
3
4
critical and necessary. Agencies shall provide information on the
4
5
programs intended outcomes, statutory authority, customers, budget,

Section 18:
1. After the key activities have been identified under
9
10
subsection A of the Section, LOFT shall identify the appropriate
10
11
performance measures for the program and its activities. As part of
11
12
the zero-based budgeting analysis process LOFT shall conduct a
12
13
thorough review of the measures and work with the Governor’s office
13
14
and the Legislature on recommendations in a coordinated manner. The
14
15
coordinated review is intended to develop a common understanding of
15
16
the program’s purpose and ensure that the measures reported satisfy
16
17
the expectations of core functions of government in Oklahoma.
17
18
Agencies will review the recommendations and offer alternative
18
19
metrics if appropriate. At the end of the process, the zero-based
19
20
budgeting report should reflect the best possible measures for the
20
21
programs and activities of an agency and provide state and agency
21
22
leadership the information needed to assess program performance and
22
23
improve operations in a report provided to the Governor and the
23
24
24
Req. No. 1413 Page 7
1
Legislature no later than December 1st each year. The zero-based
1

e. review of agency budget performance measures by The
11
12
Oklahoma Senate, The Oklahoma House of
12
13
Representatives, the Director of the Office of
13
14
Management and Enterprise Services, and LOFT with the
14
15
agency.
15
16

Section 19:
2. Performance measures are an integral part of a zero-based
16
17
budgeting analysis and should describe the workload, efficiency, and
17
18
effectiveness of the activity or program.
18
19
Performance Measures will include at least four years of actual
19
20
data and the agency should be able to explain trends over time in
20
21
outcomes as well as how those outcomes reflect a program’s overall
21
22
effectiveness. Where historical data is available, analysts will
22
23
review performance trends and consider factors contributing to
23
24
program performance. When the zero-based budgeting process results
24
Req. No. 1413 Page 8
1
in a new performance measure that the agency does not currently
1
2
track, analysts will work with the agency to develop a plan for
2
3
tracking the performance measure in all future fiscal years.
3
4

Section 20:
3. While the zero-based budgeting process focuses on
4
5
performance at the program level, the agency and state performance
5
6
metrics to which the program contributes should also be considered.
6
7
When selecting candidate measures, relevant state indicators and
7
8
federal benchmarks should be identified and included with the other
8
9
ZBB performance measures.
9
10
Performance measures should be selected based on overall value
10
11
for providing meaningful information to management and decision
11
12
makers. Quality performance measures are clear (understandable to
12
13
general audience), valid (data can be measured), and relevant to the
13
14
core purpose of the program or agency. LOFT shall use the questions
14
15
for analysis/consideration, including but not limited to:
15
16
a. Based on the performance measures identified, how are
16
17
the program and its activities performing?
17
18
b. What factors may be causing a program to be less
18
19
effective than desired and what would need to change
19
20
to increase effectiveness? This could include law
20
21
changes, funding changes, etc.
21
22
c. Is the data provided for the performance measure
22
23
reliable and accurate? Is the agency able to document
23
24
the sources used for the data?

5
6
analysis is to show the cost effectiveness or return on investment
6
7
of the program when compared to the outcomes established in the
7
8
performance metric analysis. Agencies shall explain in detail the
8
9
expenditures that comprise each object class and identify the major

23
24
Fiscal Transparency (LOFT) shall develop a list of every Oklahoma
24
Req. No. 1413 Page 1

1
State Agency. As used in this Act, “Agency” and “State Agency”
1
2
shall have the same meaning as the term pursuant to Section 415.12
2
3
of Title 74 of the Oklahoma Statues to include every Agency, Board,
3
4
Commission, Trust, and entity of government of the State of Oklahoma
4
5
that receives any appropriated funds, or is designated as a non-
5
6
appropriated entity yet operates as a State Agency, Board,
6
7
Commission, Trust, or other entity of State Government.
7
8
B. No later than December 1, 2025, LOFT shall use the full list
8
9
of Agencies developed under Subsection A of this section to develop
9
10
a tiered categorization structure for all agencies to implement a
10
11
staggered plan for agency review using zero-based budgeting.
11
12
C. The tiered categorization shall consist of a minimum of
12
13
three tiers in which to classify each agency. LOFT shall separate
13
14
the agencies into tiered categories with the higher tiers for
14
15
agencies with larger budgets, more employees, a greater statutory
15
16
footprint, more licenses, and more administrative rules.
16
17
The Tiered categorization for each state agency shall be created
17
18
by taking into consideration the following:
18
19
1. The size of the current annual budget of the agency from all
19
20
revenue sources including state appropriations, federal funds,
20
21
grants, gifts, etc;
21
22
2. The number of employees currently authorized as well as
22
23
currently filled positions by the agency;
23
24
3. The number of statutes covering the state agency operations;
24
Req. No. 1413 Page 2

1
4. The number of administrative rules promulgated by the state
1
2
agency;
2
3
5. The number of licensees overseen by the state agency; and
3
4
6. Any other relevant information as identified by LOFT.
4
5
D. LOFT shall develop a staggered plan based on the tiered
5
6
categorization structure created subsection C of this section.
6
7
1. Higher tiered agencies shall be up for review no fewer than
7
8
every 4 and no more than every 6 years. Lower tiered agencies shall
8
9
be up for review no fewer than every 2 or no more than every 4 years
9
10
on a standard system.
10
11
2. The staggered plan shall be created so that all agencies
11
12
will rotate being up for review over a maximum six year period from
12
13
first implementation.
13
14
3. The staggered plan shall take into consideration the
14
15
currently scheduled sunset of any agency so that the agency is
15
16
reviewed using zero-based budgeting the year before it is up for
16
17
sunset extension.
17
18
4. The staggered plan shall include a cross section of agencies
18
19
from each tier so that each year will have as similar of a
19
20
distribution as possible of the items listed under paragraph B so
20
21
that no one year has an exceedingly higher cumulative amount of
21
22
budget, statutes, rules, employees, or other items to be reviewed
22
23
when all agencies up for review that year than any other year on the
23
24
staggered plan.
24
Req. No. 1413 Page 3

1
5. The staggered plan will be based on the fiscal year. Each
1
2
July 1st LOFT will begin evaluating each agency up for review that
2
3
year in order to complete the review and issue a report by December
3
4
1st of that year for Legislative consideration during the next
4
5
session.
5
6
SECTION 3. NEW LAW A new section of law to be codified
6
7
in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 8018 of Title 62, unless there
7
8
is created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:
8
9
A. Beginning July 1, 2026, LOFT shall use the staggered plan
9
10
created in Section 2 of this Act to begin zero-based budgeting
10
11
reviews of the agencies identified to be included in the staggered
11
12
plan during the 2027 fiscal year and shall provide the Legislature
12
13
with zero-based budgeting recommendations by December 1st each year.
13
14
B. The LOFT zero-based budgeting review and analysis shall be a
14
15
collaborative process between LOFT, an agency, the Governor’s
15
16
office, the Legislature, and agency program staff. LOFT analysts
16
17
will meet with the agency staff as needed to review and obtain any
17
18
relevant information to perform a thorough analysis.
18
19
C. The zero-based budgeting analysis process consists of four
19
20
main steps:
20
21
1. Identify and Evaluate Key Activities
21
22
LOFT analysts will initiate the process by gathering information
22
23
from the agency and compiling their research on the programs and the
23
24
key activities of the agency. In collaboration with the agency,
24
Req. No. 1413 Page 4

1
LOFT analysts will work to ensure an adequate understanding of the
1
2
program and its activities. Agencies shall discuss the program’s key
2
3
activities and explain why the program and its activities are
3
4
critical and necessary. Agencies shall provide information on the
4
5
programs intended outcomes, statutory authority, customers, budget,
5
6
and consider alternative methods for delivering program services.

8
9
1. After the key activities have been identified under
9
10
subsection A of the Section, LOFT shall identify the appropriate
10
11
performance measures for the program and its activities. As part of
11
12
the zero-based budgeting analysis process LOFT shall conduct a
12
13
thorough review of the measures and work with the Governor’s office
13
14
and the Legislature on recommendations in a coordinated manner. The
14
15
coordinated review is intended to develop a common understanding of
15
16
the program’s purpose and ensure that the measures reported satisfy
16
17
the expectations of core functions of government in Oklahoma.
17
18
Agencies will review the recommendations and offer alternative
18
19
metrics if appropriate. At the end of the process, the zero-based
19
20
budgeting report should reflect the best possible measures for the
20
21
programs and activities of an agency and provide state and agency
21
22
leadership the information needed to assess program performance and
22
23
improve operations in a report provided to the Governor and the
23
24
24
Req. No. 1413 Page 7

1
Legislature no later than December 1st each year. The zero-based
1
2
budgeting process should include:
2
3
a. review of existing and historical performance measures
3
4
for the program,
4
5
b. development and evaluation of performance measures for
5
6
the program,
6
7
c. internal review by LOFT of zero-based budget
7
8
performance measures,
8
9
d. discussion of performance measures with the agency,
9
10
and
10
11
e. review of agency budget performance measures by The
11
12
Oklahoma Senate, The Oklahoma House of
12
13
Representatives, the Director of the Office of
13
14
Management and Enterprise Services, and LOFT with the
14
15
agency.
15
16
2. Performance measures are an integral part of a zero-based
16
17
budgeting analysis and should describe the workload, efficiency, and
17
18
effectiveness of the activity or program.
18
19
Performance Measures will include at least four years of actual
19
20
data and the agency should be able to explain trends over time in
20
21
outcomes as well as how those outcomes reflect a program’s overall
21
22
effectiveness. Where historical data is available, analysts will
22
23
review performance trends and consider factors contributing to
23
24
program performance. When the zero-based budgeting process results
24
Req. No. 1413 Page 8

1
in a new performance measure that the agency does not currently
1
2
track, analysts will work with the agency to develop a plan for
2
3
tracking the performance measure in all future fiscal years.
3
4
3. While the zero-based budgeting process focuses on
4
5
performance at the program level, the agency and state performance
5
6
metrics to which the program contributes should also be considered.
6
7
When selecting candidate measures, relevant state indicators and
7
8
federal benchmarks should be identified and included with the other
8
9
ZBB performance measures.
9
10
Performance measures should be selected based on overall value
10
11
for providing meaningful information to management and decision
11
12
makers. Quality performance measures are clear (understandable to
12
13
general audience), valid (data can be measured), and relevant to the
13
14
core purpose of the program or agency. LOFT shall use the questions
14
15
for analysis/consideration, including but not limited to:
15
16
a. Based on the performance measures identified, how are
16
17
the program and its activities performing?
17
18
b. What factors may be causing a program to be less
18
19
effective than desired and what would need to change
19
20
to increase effectiveness? This could include law
20
21
changes, funding changes, etc.
21
22
c. Is the data provided for the performance measure
22
23
reliable and accurate? Is the agency able to document
23
24
the sources used for the data?

1
d. What are the limitations of the data available for the
1
2
measures, if any?

E. Analyze the Program Budget and Expenditures
3
4
1. The financial analysis of a program will examine historical
4
5
expenditures by object class for a program. The goal of the
5
6
analysis is to show the cost effectiveness or return on investment
6
7
of the program when compared to the outcomes established in the
7
8
performance metric analysis. Agencies shall explain in detail the
8
9
expenditures that comprise each object class and identify the major
