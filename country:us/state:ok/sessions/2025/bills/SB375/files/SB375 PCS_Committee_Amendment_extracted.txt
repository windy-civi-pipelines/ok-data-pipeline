Req. No. 1634 Page 11

1 spec ified by law or established as hereinafter authorized shall be

4 1. On a highway or, part of a highway, or on roads located on
5 lands owned by a state beneficiary public trust, unless otherwise
6 established in law, a speed established by the Department of
7 Transportation on the basis of engineering and traffic
8 investigations used to determine the speed that is reasonable and
9 safe under the conditions found to exist on the highway or, part of
10 the highway, or road;
11 2. For a school bus, fifty-five (55) miles per hour on paved
12 two-lane roads except on the state highway system, the interstate
13 highway system, and the turnpike system where the maximum shall be
14 sixty-five (65) miles per hour;

19 with the latest edition of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control
20 Devices for Streets and Highways. The Department of Transportation
21 may determine on the basis of an engineering and traffic
22 investigation that a speed limit higher than twenty-five (25) miles
23 per hour may be reasonable and safe under conditions as they exist
24 upon a highway, and post an alternative school zone speed limit.
Req. No. 1634 Page 12

1 The Department shall mark such school zones, or entrances and exits
2 onto highways by buses or students, so that the maximum speed
3 provided by this section paragraph shall be established therein.
4 Exits and entrances to controlled-access highways which are within
5 such school zones shall be marked in the same manner as other
6 highways. The county commissioners shall mark such school zones
7 along the county roads so that the maximum speed provided by this
8 section paragraph shall be established therein. The signs may be

10 over all other signing projects to the foregoing duty to mark school
11 zones. The Department shall also provide other safety devices for

3 C. The Transportation Commission is hereby authorized to
4 prescribe maximum and minimum speeds for all vehicles and any
5 combinations of vehicles using controlled-access highways. Such
6 regulations shall become effective after signs have been posted on
7 these highways giving notice thereof. Such regulations may apply to
8 an entirely controlled-access highway or to selected sections
9 thereof as may be designated by the Transportation Commission. A
10 speed limit of seventy-five (75) miles per hour may be set in
11 locations comprising rural segments of the interstate highway system
12 by the Transportation Commission; provided, however, that speed is
13 determined to be safe and reasonable after a traffic or engineering
14 study has been completed by the Department. It shall be a violation
15 of this section to drive any vehicle at a faster rate of speed than
16 such prescribed maximum or at a slower rate of speed than such
17 prescribed minimum. However, all vehicles shall at all times
18 conform to the limits set forth in subsection A of this section.
19 Copies of such regulations certified as in effect on any
20 particular date by the Secretary of the Transportation Commission
21 shall be accepted as evidence in any court in this state. Whenever
22 changes have been made in speed zones, copies of such regulations
23 shall be filed with the Commissioner of Public Safety.
