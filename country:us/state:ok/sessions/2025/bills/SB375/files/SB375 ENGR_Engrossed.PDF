8 2. For a school bus, fifty-five (55) miles per hour on paved
9 two-lane roads except on the state highway system, the interstate

22 The Department shall mark such school zones, or entrances and exits
23 onto highways by buses or students, so that the maximum speed
24 provided by this section paragraph shall be established therein.
ENGR. S. B. NO. 375 Page 12

21 specified by law or established as hereinafter authorized shall be
22 maximum lawful speeds, and no person shall drive a vehicle on a
23 highway at a speed in excess of the following maximum limits:
24
ENGR. S. B. NO. 375 Page 11

2 lands owned by a state beneficiary public trust, unless otherwise
3 established in law, a speed established by the Department of
4 Transportation on the basis of engineering and traffic
5 investigations used to determine the speed that is reasonable and
6 safe under the conditions found to exist on the highway or, part of
7 the highway, or road;
8 2. For a school bus, fifty-five (55) miles per hour on paved
9 two-lane roads except on the state highway system, the interstate
10 highway system, and the turnpike system where the maximum shall be
11 sixty-five (65) miles per hour;
12 3. On any highway outside of a municipality in a properly
13 marked school zone, twenty-five (25) miles per hour, during certain
14 times as provided in Section 11-806.1 of this title and provided the
15 zone is marked with appropriate warning signs placed in accordance
16 with the latest edition of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control
17 Devices for Streets and Highways. The Department of Transportation
18 may determine on the basis of an engineering and traffic
19 investigation that a speed limit higher than twenty-five (25) miles
20 per hour may be reasonable and safe under conditions as they exist
21 upon a highway, and post an alternative school zone speed limit.
22 The Department shall mark such school zones, or entrances and exits
23 onto highways by buses or students, so that the maximum speed
24 provided by this section paragraph shall be established therein.
ENGR. S. B. NO. 375 Page 12

1 Exit s and entrances to controlled-access highways which are within
2 such school zones shall be marked in the same manner as other
3 highways. The county commissioners shall mark such school zones
4 along the county roads so that the maximum speed provided by this
5 section paragraph shall be established therein. The signs may be
6 either permanent or temporary. The Department shall give priority
7 over all other signing projects to the foregoing duty to mark school
8 zones. The Department shall also provide other safety devices for
9 school zones which are needed in the opinion of the Department;
10 4. Twenty-five (25) miles per hour or a posted alternative

22 The maximum speed limits set forth in this section may be
23 altered as authorized in Sections 11-802 and 11-803 of this title.
24
ENGR. S. B. NO. 375 Page 13

1 C. The Transportation Commission is hereby authorized to
2 prescribe maximum and minimum speeds for all vehicles and any
3 combinations of vehicles using controlled-access highways. Such
4 regulations shall become effective after signs have been posted on
5 these highways giving notice thereof. Such regulations may apply to
6 an entirely controlled-access highway or to selected sections
7 thereof as may be designated by the Transportation Commission. A
8 speed limit of seventy-five (75) miles per hour may be set in
9 locations comprising rural segments of the interstate highway system
10 by the Transportation Commission; provided, however, that speed is
11 determined to be safe and reasonable after a traffic or engineering
12 study has been completed by the Department. It shall be a violation
13 of this section to drive any vehicle at a faster rate of speed than

ENGR. S. B. NO. 375 Page 19

17 beneficiaries of the trust. Provided, however, a municipality with
18 a governing body consisting of fewer than seven (7) members shall be

20 under this subsection by a three-fifths (3/5) vote of the governing
21 body.

7 public for any length of time, and the trust has not dedicated the
8 roadway for public use by written easement, plat, or similar writing
9 recorded in the land records of the county clerk of the county in
