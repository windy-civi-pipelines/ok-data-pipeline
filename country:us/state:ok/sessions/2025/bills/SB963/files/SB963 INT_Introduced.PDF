12
13
SECTION 1. AMENDATORY 69 O.S. 2021, Section 1709, is
13
14
amended to read as follows:
14
15
Section 1709. A. The Oklahoma Turnpike Authority may provide
15
16
by resolution, at one time or from time to time, for the issuance of
16
17
turnpike revenue bonds of the Authority for the purpose of paying
17
18
all or any part of the cost of any one or more turnpike projects in
18
19
such amount or amounts not to exceed Two Billion Seven Hundred Ten
19
20
Million Dollars ($2,710,000,000.00) in total aggregate indebtedness
20
21
outstanding at any time. The Authority, when it finds that it would
21
22
be economical and beneficial to do so, may combine two or more, or
22
23
any part thereof, or all of its proposed projects into one unit and
23
24
consider the same as one project to the same extent and with like
24
Req. No. 1337 Page 1

1
effect as if the same were a single project. The principal of and
1
2
the interest on the bonds shall be payable solely from the funds
2
3
provided for such payment. The bonds of each issue shall be dated,
3
4
shall bear interest at such rate or rates not exceeding the
4
5
limitations pertaining to public trust indebtedness from time to
5
6
time expressed in subsection E F of Section 176 of Title 60 of the
6
7
Oklahoma Statutes, shall mature at such time or times not exceeding
7
8
forty (40) years from their date or dates, as may be determined by
8
9
the Authority, and may be made redeemable before maturity at the
9
10
option of the Authority at such price or prices and pursuant to such
10
11
terms and conditions as may be fixed by the Authority prior to the
11
12
issuance of the bonds. The Authority shall determine the form of
12
13
the bonds, including any interest coupons to be attached thereto,
13
14
and the manner of execution of the bonds, and shall fix the
14
15
denomination or denominations of the bonds and the place or places
15
16
of payment of principal and interest, which may be at any bank or
16
17
trust company within or without the state. If any officer whose
17
18
signature or facsimile of whose signature appears on any bonds or
18
19
coupons shall cease to be said such officer before the delivery of
19
20
the bonds, the signature or the facsimile shall nevertheless be
20
21
valid and sufficient for all purposes the same as if the person had
21
22
remained in office until such delivery. All bonds issued pursuant
22
23
to the provisions of this article shall have all the qualities and
23
24
incidents of negotiable instruments subject to the negotiable
24
Req. No. 1337 Page 2

1
instruments law of this state. The bonds may be issued in coupon or
1
2
in registered form, or both, as the Authority may determine, and
2
3
provisions may be made for the registration of any coupon bonds as
3
4
to principal alone and also as to both principal and interest, and
4
5
for the reconversion into coupon bonds of any bonds registered as to
5
6
both principal and interest. The Authority may sell the bonds in
6
7
such amounts and in such manner, either at public or private sale,
7
8
and for such price, as it may determine to be in the best interest
8
9
of this state, but in no event at a discount in excess of that from
9
10
time to time expressed in said subsection E G of Section 176 of
10
11
Title 60 of the Oklahoma Statutes.
11
12
B. The proceeds of the bonds of each issue shall be used solely
12
13
for the payment of the cost of the turnpike project for which such
13
14
bonds have been issued, and shall be disbursed in such manner and
14
15
pursuant to such restrictions, if any, as the Authority may provide
15
16
in the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds or in the
16
17
trust agreement securing the same. If the proceeds of the bonds of
17
18
any issue, by error of estimates or otherwise, shall be less than
18
19
such cost, additional bonds may in like manner be issued to provide
19
20
the amount of such deficit, and, unless otherwise provided for in
20
21
the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds or in the
21
22
trust agreement securing the same, shall be deemed to be of the same
22
23
issue and shall be entitled to payment from the same fund without
23
24
preference or priority of the bonds first issued. If the proceeds
24
Req. No. 1337 Page 3

1
of the bonds of any issue shall exceed such cost, the surplus shall
1
2
be deposited to the credit of the sinking fund for such bonds, or
2
3
shall be used by the Authority in implementing any other power
3
4
expressly granted to the Authority in this article.
4
5
C. Prior to the preparation of definitive bonds, the Authority,
5

subject to like restrictions, may issue interim receipts or
6
7
temporary bonds, with or without coupons, exchangeable for
7
8
definitive bonds when such bonds have been executed and are
8
9
available for delivery. The Authority may also provide for the
9
10
replacement of any bonds which have become mutilated or were
10
11
destroyed or lost. Bonds may be issued pursuant to the provisions
11
12
of this article without obtaining the consent of any department,
12
