A Resolution commemorating the 90th anniversary of
Black Sunday; and reminding Oklahomans of the
continuing need to protect and conserve our soil,
water, and other natural resources.
WHEREAS, the Dust Bowl of the 1930s was the worst natural
disaster of the time in the United States, having a profound impact
on the people and the land of Oklahoma, specifically with the storm
known as Black Sunday, on April 14, 1935; and
WHEREAS, following the Black Sunday storm, Oklahoma became
committed to soil conservation and the protection of our soil
resources, becoming a national leader in conservation and working
with landowners to install land management practices that have
transformed, protected, and sustained the land for the 90 years
since Black Sunday; and

WHEREAS, Oklahomaâ€™s soil conservation effort has been a
longstanding and effective partnership between local conservation
districts, the Oklahoma Conservation Commission, and the federal
Natural Resources Conservation Service.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE OF THE 1ST SESSION
OF THE 60TH OKLAHOMA LEGISLATURE:
That the State of Oklahoma and the Oklahoma Senate, this April
14th, commemorate the 90th anniversary of Black Sunday to remind
Oklahomans of the importance of our soil resources and the
continuing need to protect and conserve our soil, water, and other
natural resources.
