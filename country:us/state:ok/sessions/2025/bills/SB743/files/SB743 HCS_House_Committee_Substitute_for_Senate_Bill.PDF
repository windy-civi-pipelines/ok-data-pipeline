19 BE IT ENACTED BY THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF OKLAHOMA:
20 SECTION 1. NEW LAW A new section of law not to be
21 codified in the Oklahoma Statutes reads as follows:
22 The Legislature finds that the right of the people to meet and
23 assemble for religious worship is imperative for the people of this
24 state; that the exercise of the right of a person to protest at
Req. No. 13573 Page 1

1 plac es of religious worship must be balanced against the right of
2 another person to meet and assemble for religious worship in an
3 unobstructed manner; and that preventing the willful obstruction of
4 access of a person to places of religious worship is a matter of
5 statewide concern. Therefore, the Legislature declares that it is a
6 compelling public interest of this state to protect the ability of
7 its people to meet and assemble for religious worship without
8 willful obstruction.

15 punishable by a fine not to exceed Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00),
16 by imprisonment in the county jail for a term not to exceed one (1)
17 year, or by both such fine and imprisonment. A person who commits a
18 second or subsequent offense shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a
19 felony punishable by a fine not to exceed One Thousand Dollars
20 ($1,000.00), by imprisonment in the custody of the Department of
21 Corrections for a term not to exceed two (2) years, or by both such
