9 another person to meet and assemble for religious worship in an
10 unobstructed manner; and that preventing the willful obstruction of
11 access of a person to places of religious worship is a matter of
12 statewide concern. Therefore, the Legislature declares that it is a

14 its people to meet and assemble for religious worship without
15 willful obstruction.

22 punishable by a fine not to exceed Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00),
23 by imprisonment in the county jail for a term not to exceed one (1)
24 year, or by both such fine and imprisonment. A person who commits a
