December meeting each year and, if the requirements of
this act are fulfilled, the State Board shall make a
final determination at its February meeting each year
whether the comparison year total collections exceeds
the base year total collections plus the income tax
reduction cost threshold, and a reduction in the
income tax rates otherwise prescribed pursuant to
paragraphs 1 and 2 of subsection D of Section 2355 of
