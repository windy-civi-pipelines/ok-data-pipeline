9
10
protective order exists under subsection A of this section to
10
11

13
14

Section 4:
1. Is a current or former high-ranking officer of a government
14
15
entity or any other public or private organization that is large and
15
16

17
18

If the party or person meets the burden, the court shall issue
1
2
an order preventing the deposition unless the party seeking the

3
4
of discovery, that such discovery is inadequate, and that the
4
5
officer has unique and personal knowledge of discoverable
5
6
information.
6
7
To the extent that the party or the person seeking a protective
7

8
9
but fewer than all, matters relevant to the subject matter involved
9
10
in the pending action, the court may limit the scope of the
10
11
deposition accordingly rather than prohibiting altogether the
11
12
deposition of the officer. The court may vacate or modify the order
12
13
if, after additional discovery, the party seeking the deposition can
13
14
meet its burden under this section.
14
15
C. AWARD OF EXPENSES OF MOTION. If the motion is granted, the
15

17
18
attorney advising such conduct or both of them to pay to the moving
18
19
party the reasonable expenses incurred in obtaining the order,
19
20
including attorney fees, unless the court finds that the opposition
20
21
to the motion was substantially justified or that other
21
22
circumstances make an award of expenses unjust.
22
23
If the motion is denied, the court may, after opportunity for
23
24
hearing, require the moving party or the attorney advising the
24
Req. No. 1527 Page 3
1
motion or both of them to pay to the party or deponent who opposed
1
2
the motion the reasonable expenses incurred in opposing the motion,
2

including attorney fees, unless the court finds that the making of
3
4
the motion was substantially justified or that other circumstances
4
5
make an award of expenses unjust.
5
6
If the motion is granted in part and denied in part, the court

may apportion the reasonable expenses incurred in relation to the

8
motion among the parties and persons in a just manner.
