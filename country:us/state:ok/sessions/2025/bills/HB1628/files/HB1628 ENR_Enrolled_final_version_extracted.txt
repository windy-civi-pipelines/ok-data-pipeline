the qualifying party by shortening or lengthening the next renewal
date by up to six (6) months. Beginning the effective date of this
act November 1, 2014, new initial registrations and endorsements
will be issued for up to eighteen (18) months and due for renewal
the last day of the birth month of the qualifying party. After
initial proration or conversion to birth month, no subsequent
registration or endorsement shall be issued for longer than one (1)
year and all endorsements shall expire on the last day in the birth
month of the qualifying party. The Construction Industries Board
shall implement rules for the scheduling of expiration and renewal
of registrations and endorsements, including the prorating of fees
and the identification and information of the qualifying party. The
commercial or residential roofer endorsement shall expire on the
expiration date of the supporting registration.
B. An applicant or qualifying party whose registration or
endorsement is refused or denied by the registrar may obtain a
hearing before the Committee of Roofing Examiners with written
notice to the registrar of the grounds for appeal and identification
of evidence to be presented in support of the application
requirements and any other information showing the applicant’s
ability and willingness to comply with the requirements of the act,
and to protect the public health, safety and welfare. Such appeals
to the Committee of Roofing Examiners shall be made by the
qualifying party in writing to the registrar within fourteen (14)
days from the date of the written notification of denial or refusal
to register or endorse.
C. The Construction Industries Board shall issue a commercial
or residential roofer endorsement to any person who:

having successfully passed the appropriate examination; and

Endorsements renewed more than thirty (30) days following the
date of expiration may only be renewed upon application and payment
of the required fees and payment of late renewal fee in the amount
of One Hundred Dollars ($100.00).
No endorsement shall be renewed unless the licensee has
completed the required hours of continuing education recommended by
the Committee and set forth by rule.
No late fee shall be charged to renew a registration or
endorsement which expired while the applicant was in active military
service, if application for renewal is made within one (1) year of
discharge from active duty status.

SECTION 3. AMENDATORY 59 O.S. 2021, Section 1151.10, is
amended to read as follows:
Section 1151.10. A. Within twenty-five (25) calendar days from
the date of application, the registrar shall either issue or deny
the roofing contractor registration. No registration shall be
issued to a qualifying party until the registrar receives all
documentation and fees necessary to obtain a registration
certificate in good standing. The registration certificate issued
on an original application entitles the person to act as a roofing
contractor within this state, subject to the limitations of the
Roofing Contractor Registration Act. Until January 1, 2015, all
registrations shall expire on June 30 of each year and may be
renewed from year to year. Beginning no later than January 1, 2015,
all registrations issued shall be renewed based on staggered
expiration dates of the last day of the birth month of the
qualifying party so that all registrations and endorsements shall
expire on the last day in the birth month of the qualifying party.
The Construction Industries Board is authorized to prorate
registration and renewal fees, as described by rule, so that
beginning January 1, 2015, or thirty (30) days after rules have been
ENR. H. B. NO. 1628 Page 10

approved, fees for renewals previously due by June 30, 2015, are
prorated and converted to be due the last day of the birth month of
the qualifying party by shortening or lengthening the next renewal
date by up to six (6) months. Beginning the effective date of this
act November 1, 2014, new initial registrations and endorsements
will be issued for up to eighteen (18) months and due for renewal
the last day of the birth month of the qualifying party. After
initial proration or conversion to birth month, no subsequent
registration or endorsement shall be issued for longer than one (1)
year and all endorsements shall expire on the last day in the birth
month of the qualifying party. The Construction Industries Board
shall implement rules for the scheduling of expiration and renewal
of registrations and endorsements, including the prorating of fees
and the identification and information of the qualifying party. The
commercial or residential roofer endorsement shall expire on the
expiration date of the supporting registration.
B. An applicant or qualifying party whose registration or
endorsement is refused or denied by the registrar may obtain a
hearing before the Committee of Roofing Examiners with written
notice to the registrar of the grounds for appeal and identification
of evidence to be presented in support of the application
requirements and any other information showing the applicant’s
ability and willingness to comply with the requirements of the act,
and to protect the public health, safety and welfare. Such appeals
to the Committee of Roofing Examiners shall be made by the
qualifying party in writing to the registrar within fourteen (14)
days from the date of the written notification of denial or refusal
to register or endorse.
C. The Construction Industries Board shall issue a commercial
or residential roofer endorsement to any person who:
1. Has been certified by the Committee of Roofing Examiners as
having successfully passed the appropriate examination; and
2. Has paid the application and endorsement fee and has
otherwise complied with all of the provisions of the commercial or
residential roofer endorsement of the Roofing Contractor
Registration Act. The endorsement fee is hereby established as up
to Two Hundred Dollars ($200.00). Renewal of a commercial or
residential roofer endorsement shall be One Hundred Dollars
($100.00).
ENR. H. B. NO. 1628 Page 11

Endorsements renewed more than thirty (30) days following the
date of expiration may only be renewed upon application and payment
of the required fees and payment of late renewal fee in the amount
of One Hundred Dollars ($100.00).
No endorsement shall be renewed unless the licensee has
completed the required hours of continuing education recommended by
the Committee and set forth by rule.
No late fee shall be charged to renew a registration or
endorsement which expired while the applicant was in active military
service, if application for renewal is made within one (1) year of
discharge from active duty status.
SECTION 4. NEW LAW A new section of law to be codified
in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 1151.25a of Title 59, unless
there is created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:
A. Except as otherwise provided in the Roofing Contractor
Registration Act, on and after the effective date of this act, every
roofing contractor, except for those defined in subsection G of this

and rules before acting or being endorsed as a residential roofing
contractor. For applicants who have been registered and in good

period from the effective date of this act to either pass the exam
or complete an additional ten (10) hours of continuing education
credits approved in advance by the Committee of Roofing Examiners to
be granted a residential roofer endorsement. Any applicant who has
been registered, is in good standing with the Board, and possesses a
current commercial roofer endorsement on the effective date of this
act shall be exempt from the residential roofing examination and
additional ten (10) hours of continuing education credits required
to receive a residential roofing endorsement.
B. Examinations for a residential roofer endorsement shall be
uniform and practical in nature and sufficiently strict to test the

shall be offered at least monthly; dates, times, and locations shall
be determined by the registrar or third-party vendor with approval
of the registrar.
C. Any applicant initially failing to pass the examination
shall not be permitted to take another examination for a period of
thirty (30) days. Any applicant subsequently failing to pass the
examination shall not be permitted to take another examination for a
period of ninety (90) days. However, in a declared state of
emergency, the examination shall be available as often as possible
as determined by the registrar.
D. No residential roofer endorsement shall be renewed unless
the qualifying party has completed the required hours of continuing
education pursuant to subsection A of this section.
E. For all new applicants not registered and in good standing
with the Construction Industries Board prior to the effective date
of this act, the Construction Industries Board shall issue a
residential roofer endorsement to qualifying applicants no sooner
than thirty (30) days from the date of successful completion of the
exam. New applicants shall not be allowed to sell, offer, bid,
inspect, or perform any residential roofing contractor work in this
state until a residential roofer endorsement is issued.

Construction Industries Board prior to the effective date of this
act:
1. The residential roofer endorsement shall be issued
immediately upon compliance with the provisions of this section; and
2. Applicants shall be allowed to continue residential roofing
contractor work at all times during the residential roofer
endorsement application process.
G. The residential roofing endorsement shall not apply to
roofing labor contractors who:
1. Only provide roofing construction labor services;
2. Are working directly for a registered roofing contractor
that possesses a residential roofing endorsement; and
ENR. H. B. NO. 1628 Page 13
