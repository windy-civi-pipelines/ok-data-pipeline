5 the last day of the birth month of the qualifying party. After
6 initial proration or conversion to birth month, no subsequent
7 registration or endorsement shall be issued for longer than one (1)
8 year and all endorsements shall expire on the last day in the birth
9 month of the qualifying party. The Construction Industries Board
10 shall implement rules for the scheduling of expiration and renewal
11 of registrations and endorsements, including the prorating of fees
12 and the identification and information of the qualifying party. The
13 commercial or residential roofer endorsement shall expire on the
14 expiration date of the supporting registration.

16 endorsement is refused or denied by the registrar may obtain a
17 hearing before the Committee of Roofing Examiners with written
18 notice to the registrar of the grounds for appeal and identification
19 of evidence to be presented in support of the application
20 requirements and any other information showing the applicant’s
21 ability and willingness to comply with the requirements of the act,
22 and to protect the public health, safety and welfare. Such appeals
23 to the Committee of Roofing Examiners shall be made by the
24 qualifying party in writing to the registrar within fourteen (14)

12 residential roofer endorsement shall be One Hundred Dollars
13 ($100.00).
14 Endorsements renewed more than thirty (30) days following the
15 date of expiration may only be renewed upon application and payment
16 of the required fees and payment of late renewal fee in the amount
17 of One Hundred Dollars ($100.00).
18 No endorsement shall be renewed unless the licensee has
19 completed the required hours of continuing education recommended by
20 the Committee and set forth by rule.
21 No late fee shall be charged to renew a registration or
22 endorsement which expired while the applicant was in active military
23 service, if application for renewal is made within one (1) year of
24 discharge from active duty status.
