14 WHEREAS, family caregivers play a vital role in supporting loved
15 ones with long-term health needs, often bearing significant
16 financial and emotional burdens as they provide essential care; and
17 WHEREAS, the Credit for Caring Act seeks to provide a federal
18 tax credit of up to $5,000 annually to working family caregivers,
19 helping to offset the high costs of caregiving and alleviating
20 financial strain; and
21 WHEREAS, Oklahoma is home to an estimated 490,000 family
22 caregivers who collectively contribute over $6.6 billion in unpaid
23 care, providing critical support that allows many older Oklahomans

1 to r emain in his or her home rather than move to costly
2 institutional care facilities; and
3 WHEREAS, studies indicate that a significant number of family
4 caregivers nationwide report spending an average of more than $7,000
5 per year out-of-pocket on expenses for his or her loved ones,
6 including transportation, medical equipment, home modifications, in-
7 home care services, and respite care; and
8 WHEREAS, a large percentage of Oklahoma family caregivers face
9 similar financial challenges, as they are often required to cover
10 out-of-pocket costs for caregiving services while balancing work and
11 caregiving responsibilities; and
12 WHEREAS, without the contributions of family caregivers, many
13 older citizens would likely face higher costs associated with
14 institutionalized care, ultimately shifting the financial burden to
15 taxpayers and the state; and
16 WHEREAS, the Oklahoma Legislature has already demonstrated
17 leadership by passing the nation's first comprehensive state-based
18 caregiver tax credit, recognizing the need for policy solutions that
19 support family caregivers; and
20 WHEREAS, President Donald Trump has expressed his support for
21 family caregivers, and Oklahoma Representative Tom Cole has co-
22 sponsored the Credit for Caring Act, we urge our Congressional
23 Delegation to follow their lead by supporting the Credit for Caring
24 Act at the federal level.
