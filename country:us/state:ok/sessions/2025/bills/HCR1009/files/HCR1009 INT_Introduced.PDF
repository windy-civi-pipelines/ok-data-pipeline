12 WHEREAS, family caregivers play a vital role in supporting loved
13 ones with long-term health needs, often bearing significant
14 financial and emotional burdens as they provide essential care; and
15 WHEREAS, the Credit for Caring Act seeks to provide a federal
16 tax credit of up to $5,000 annually to working family caregivers,
17 helping to offset the high costs of caregiving and alleviating
18 financial strain; and
19 WHEREAS, Oklahoma is home to an estimated 490,000 family
20 caregivers who collectively contribute over $6.6 billion in unpaid
21 care, providing critical support that allows many older Oklahomans
22 to remain in his or her home rather than move to costly
23 institutional care facilities; and

Req. No. 12851 Page 1

1 WHEREAS, studies indicate that a significant number of family
2 caregivers nationwide report spending an average of more than $7,000
3 per year out-of-pocket on expenses for his or her loved ones,
4 including transportation, medical equipment, home modifications, in-
5 home care services, and respite care; and
6 WHEREAS, a large percentage of Oklahoma family caregivers face
7 similar financial challenges, as they are often required to cover
8 out-of-pocket costs for caregiving services while balancing work and
9 caregiving responsibilities; and
10 WHEREAS, without the contributions of family caregivers, many
11 older citizens would likely face higher costs associated with
12 institutionalized care, ultimately shifting the financial burden to
13 taxpayers and the state; and
14 WHEREAS, the Oklahoma Legislature has already demonstrated
15 leadership by passing the nation's first comprehensive state-based
16 caregiver tax credit, recognizing the need for policy solutions that
17 support family caregivers; and
18 WHEREAS, President Donald Trump has expressed his support for
19 family caregivers, and Oklahoma Representative Tom Cole has co-
20 sponsored the Credit for Caring Act, we urge our Congressional
21 Delegation to follow their lead by supporting the Credit for Caring
22 Act at the federal level.
