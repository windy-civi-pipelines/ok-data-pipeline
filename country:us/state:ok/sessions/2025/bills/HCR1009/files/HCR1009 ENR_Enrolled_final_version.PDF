A Concurrent Resolution urging Oklahoma's
Congressional Delegation to support the Credit for
Caring Act for family caregivers.
WHEREAS, family caregivers play a vital role in supporting loved
ones with long-term health needs, often bearing significant
financial and emotional burdens as they provide essential care; and
WHEREAS, the Credit for Caring Act seeks to provide a federal
tax credit of up to $5,000 annually to working family caregivers,
helping to offset the high costs of caregiving and alleviating
financial strain; and
WHEREAS, Oklahoma is home to an estimated 490,000 family
caregivers who collectively contribute over $6.6 billion in unpaid
care, providing critical support that allows many older Oklahomans
to remain in his or her home rather than move to costly
institutional care facilities; and
WHEREAS, studies indicate that a significant number of family
caregivers nationwide report spending an average of more than $7,000
per year out-of-pocket on expenses for his or her loved ones,

including transportation, medical equipment, home modifications, in-
home care services, and respite care; and
WHEREAS, a large percentage of Oklahoma family caregivers face
similar financial challenges, as they are often required to cover
out-of-pocket costs for caregiving services while balancing work and
caregiving responsibilities; and
WHEREAS, without the contributions of family caregivers, many
older citizens would likely face higher costs associated with
institutionalized care, ultimately shifting the financial burden to
taxpayers and the state; and
WHEREAS, the Oklahoma Legislature has already demonstrated
leadership by passing the nation's first comprehensive state-based
caregiver tax credit, recognizing the need for policy solutions that
support family caregivers; and
WHEREAS, because President Donald Trump has expressed his
support for family caregivers, and Oklahoma Representative Tom Cole
has co-sponsored the Credit for Caring Act, we urge our
Congressional Delegation to follow their lead by supporting the
Credit for Caring Act at the federal level.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
OF THE 1ST SESSION OF THE 60TH OKLAHOMA LEGISLATURE, THE SENATE
CONCURRING THEREIN:
THAT we, the Oklahoma House of Representatives and the Oklahoma
State Senate, call upon Oklahoma's Congressional delegation to
support and advocate for the passage of the Credit for Caring Act,
which would provide much-needed financial relief to the hardworking
family caregivers of Oklahoma and the nation, allowing them to
continue their vital work without sacrificing their financial well-
being.
THAT a copy of this resolution be sent to members of Oklahoma's
Congressional delegation in Washington, D.C.
