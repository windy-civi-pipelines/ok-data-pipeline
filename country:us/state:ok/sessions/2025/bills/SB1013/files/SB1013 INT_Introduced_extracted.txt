16

Section 3:
Section 5. A. The rights and remedies granted to an employee
16
17
subject to the provisions of the Administrative Workers’
17
18
Compensation Act shall be exclusive of all other rights and remedies
18
19
of the employee, his legal representative, dependents, next of kin,
19
20
or anyone else claiming rights to recovery on behalf of the employee
20
21
against the employer, including a general contractor that provides
21
22

22
23

23
24

Req. No. 327 Page 1

on account of injury, illness, or death. Negligent acts of a co-
1
2
employee may not be imputed to the employer. No role, capacity, or
2
3
persona of any employer, principal, officer, director, employee, or
3
4
stockholder other than that existing in the role of employer of the
4
5
employee shall be relevant for consideration for purposes of this
5
6
act, and the remedies and rights provided by this act shall be
6
7
exclusive regardless of the multiple roles, capacities, or personas
7
8
the employer may be deemed to have.

Section 4:
1. An employer fails to secure the payment of compensation due
10
11
to the employee as required by this act. An injured employee, or
11
12
his or her legal representative in case death results from the
12
13
injury, may, at his or her option, elect to claim compensation under
13
14
this act or to maintain a legal action in court for damages on
14
15
account of the injury or death; or
15
16

Section 5:
2. The injury was caused by an intentional tort committed by
16
17
the employer. An intentional tort shall exist only when the
17
18
employee is injured as a result of willful, deliberate, specific
18
19
intent of the employer to cause such injury. Allegations or proof
19
20
that the employer had knowledge that the injury was substantially
20
21
certain to result from the employer’s conduct shall not constitute
21
22
an intentional tort. The employee shall plead facts that show it is
22
23
at least as likely as it is not that the employer acted with the
23
24
24
Req. No. 327 Page 2
1
purpose of injuring the employee. The issue of whether an act is an
1
2
intentional tort shall be a question of law.
2
3
C. The immunity from civil liability described in subsection A
3
4
of this section shall apply regardless of whether the injured
4

7
D. If an employer has failed to secure the payment of
7
8
compensation for his or her injured employee as provided for in this

9
act, an injured employee, or his or her legal representative if
9
10
death results from the injury, may maintain an action in the
10
11
district court for damages on account of such injury.
11
12
E. The immunity created by the provisions of this section shall
12
13
not extend to action against another employer, or its employees, on
13
14
the same job as the injured or deceased worker where such other
14
15
employer does not stand in the position of an intermediate or
15
16
principal employer to the immediate employer of the injured or
16
17
deceased worker.
17
18
F. The immunity created by the provisions of this section shall
18
19
not extend to action against another employer, or its employees, on
19
20
the same job as the injured or deceased worker even though such
20
21
other employer may be considered as standing in the position of a
21
22
special master of a loaned servant where such special master neither
22
23
is the immediate employer of the injured or deceased worker nor
23
24
24
Req. No. 327 Page 3
1
stands in the position of an intermediate or principal employer to
1
2
the immediate employer of the injured or deceased worker.
2
3
G. This section shall not be construed to abrogate the loaned
3
4
servant doctrine in any respect other than that described in
4
5
subsection F of this section. Nothing in this act shall be
5
6
construed to relieve the employer from any other penalty provided
6

for in this act for failure to secure the payment of compensation
7
8
under this act.
8
9
H. For the purpose of extending the immunity of this section,
9
10
any architect, professional engineer, or land surveyor shall be
10
11
deemed an intermediate or principal employer for services performed
11
12
at or on the site of a construction project, but this immunity shall
12
13
not extend to the negligent preparation of design plans and
13
14
specifications.
14
15
I. If the employer has failed to secure the payment of
15
16
compensation as provided in this act or in the case of an
16
17
intentional tort, the injured employee or his or her legal

6
7
and scope of the general contractor’s business, the general
7
8
contractor enters into a contract with a subcontractor who does not
8
9
have employees, the general contractor shall be treated as the
9
10
employer of the subcontractor for the purposes of the Administrative
10
11
Workers’ Compensation Act and may enter into an agreement for the
11
12
deduction of premiums paid in accordance with subsection C of this
