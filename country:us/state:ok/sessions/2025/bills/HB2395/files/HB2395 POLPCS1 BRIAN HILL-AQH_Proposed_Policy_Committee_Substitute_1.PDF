2 less than two and one-half (2 1/2) hours per school day, and full-
3 day programs of six (6) hours. The standards for all early
4 childhood education programs shall require a certified teacher, as
5 specified in this section, to be present in the classroom for the
6 length of the school day. Such program shall:
7 1. Be directed toward developmentally appropriate objectives
8 for such children, rather than toward academic objectives suitable
9 for older children;
10 2. Accommodate the needs of all children and families
11 regardless of socioeconomic circumstances; and
12 3. Require that any teacher employed by a public school to
13 teach in such early childhood education program shall be certified
14 in early childhood education.
15 C. The superintendent of any school district providing
16 classroom space or other school facilities for a federally sponsored
17 Head Start program that is planning to make a material change in the
18 arrangement, shall give notice to the director of the Head Start
19 program at least seven (7) days prior to a school board hearing on
20 the matter.
21 D. A school district may offer such early childhood education
22 program within the district, in cooperation with other districts,
23 through the use of transfers as specified by law, or by contracting
24 with a private or public provider of early childhood education

2 public or private child care provider based upon selection criteria
3 established by the district. If the program is provided through
4 contract with a private or public provider other than a school
5 district, the contract may only be continued if each teacher serving
6 the school on and after January 1, 1993, is certified in early
7 childhood education, except that all teachers, without such
8 certification, hired by such provider prior to January 1, 1993, and
9 serving in the school as an early childhood education teacher shall
10 be required to obtain certification on or before the beginning of
11 the 1996-97 school year. Any person who has been employed as an
12 early childhood educator with the Head Start Program, has a child
13 development associate degree (CDA) and has at least five (5) years
14 of experience in such employment shall be certified in early
15 childhood education for purposes of employment in the public schools
16 of this state to teach in early childhood education for children
17 four (4) years of age and younger; if such person is recertified in
18 child development by the Council for Early Childhood Professional
19 Recognition within five (5) years prior to the expiration of the
20 person's early childhood certificate that was issued by the State
21 Board of Education, such person shall be granted a renewal
22 certificate in early childhood education by the State Board of
23 Education upon expiration of the early childhood certificate.

4 public provider pursuant to a contract as authorized in this
5 section, the contract shall address the requirements for
6 implementing the induction program as required in Section 6-195 of
7 this title. Teachers employed by a private or public provider in an
8 early childhood education program provided through contract with a
9 public school district shall receive in salary and/or fringe
10 benefits amounts not less than the amounts specified in the schedule
11 set forth in Section 18-114.14 18-114.15 of this title.
12 F. The State Board of Education shall promulgate rules to
13 provide for the implementation of such program.

15 by school districts that have formed interlocal cooperative
16 agreements pursuant to Section 5-117b of this title.
17 H. The term "prekindergarten" shall mean early childhood
18 education for purposes of this title.
19 I. The State Board of Education shall ensure that the standards
20 for early childhood education are aligned with any new subject
21 matter standards adopted pursuant to Section 11-103.6a of this
22 title.

11 requesting the transfer has not reached the age of four (4) three
12 (3) years on or before September 1, the district may refuse to
13 accept the nonresident child if the district determines the child is
14 not ready for an early childhood program. Children who are accepted

16 tuition fee has been paid.
17 2. The provisions of paragraph 1 of this subsection shall not
18 apply to a school district that enrolls nonresident students from a
