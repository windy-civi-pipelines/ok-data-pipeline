15 SECTION 1. AMENDATORY 70 O.S. 2021, Section 11-103.7, is
16 amended to read as follows:

18 and four-year-old children the opportunity to participate in an
19 early childhood education program.
20 B. The State Board of Education shall promulgate standards for
21 early childhood education programs for children who are at least
22 four (4) three (3) years of age but not more than five (5) years of
23 age on or before September 1 of the ensuing school year. The
24 standards shall include both half-day programs consisting of not
Req. No. 12777 Page 1

1 less than two and one-half (2 1/2) hours per school day, and full-
2 day programs of six (6) hours. The standards for all early
3 childhood education programs shall require a certified teacher, as
4 specified in this section, to be present in the classroom for the
5 length of the school day. Such program shall:
6 1. Be directed toward developmentally appropriate objectives
7 for such children, rather than toward academic objectives suitable
8 for older children;
9 2. Accommodate the needs of all children and families
10 regardless of socioeconomic circumstances; and
11 3. Require that any teacher employed by a public school to
12 teach in such early childhood education program shall be certified
13 in early childhood education.
14 C. The superintendent of any school district providing
15 classroom space or other school facilities for a federally sponsored
16 Head Start program that is planning to make a material change in the
17 arrangement, shall give notice to the director of the Head Start
18 program at least seven (7) days prior to a school board hearing on
19 the matter.
20 D. A school district may offer such early childhood education
21 program within the district, in cooperation with other districts,
22 through the use of transfers as specified by law, or by contracting
23 with a private or public provider of early childhood education
24 programs, or by contracting for classroom space with a licensed
Req. No. 12777 Page 2

1 publ ic or private child care provider based upon selection criteria
2 established by the district. If the program is provided through
3 contract with a private or public provider other than a school
4 district, the contract may only be continued if each teacher serving
5 the school on and after January 1, 1993, is certified in early
6 childhood education, except that all teachers, without such
7 certification, hired by such provider prior to January 1, 1993, and
8 serving in the school as an early childhood education teacher shall
9 be required to obtain certification on or before the beginning of
10 the 1996-97 school year. Any person who has been employed as an
11 early childhood educator with the Head Start Program, has a child
12 development associate degree (CDA) and has at least five (5) years
13 of experience in such employment shall be certified in early
14 childhood education for purposes of employment in the public schools
15 of this state to teach in early childhood education for children
16 four (4) years of age and younger; if such person is recertified in
17 child development by the Council for Early Childhood Professional
18 Recognition within five (5) years prior to the expiration of the
19 person's early childhood certificate that was issued by the State
20 Board of Education, such person shall be granted a renewal
21 certificate in early childhood education by the State Board of
22 Education upon expiration of the early childhood certificate.
23 Provided, private or public providers shall meet such other
24 standards required by law and by the State Board of Education.

2 public provider pursuant to a contract as authorized in this
3 section, the contract shall address the requirements for
4 implementing the induction program as required in Section 6-195 of
5 this title. Teachers employed by a private or public provider in an
6 early childhood education program provided through contract with a
7 public school district shall receive in salary and/or fringe
8 benefits amounts not less than the amounts specified in the schedule
9 set forth in Section 18-114.14 18-114.15 of this title.
10 F. The State Board of Education shall promulgate rules to
11 provide for the implementation of such program.

13 by school districts that have formed interlocal cooperative
14 agreements pursuant to Section 5-117b of this title.
15 H. The term "prekindergarten" shall mean early childhood
16 education for purposes of this title.

19 matter standards adopted pursuant to Section 11-103.6a of this
20 title.

6 accommodate the child in an early childhood education class, as
7 provided for in the Education Open Transfer Act. If the child
8 requesting the transfer has not reached the age of four (4) three
9 (3) years on or before September 1, the district may refuse to
10 accept the nonresident child if the district determines the child is
11 not ready for an early childhood program. Children who are accepted
12 in a program outside their district of residence as provided in this
13 paragraph shall be included in the average daily membership of the
14 district providing the program for State Aid funding subject to the
15 State Aid formula weight limitations set forth in paragraph 1 of
16 this subsection; and
17 3. The State Board of Education shall promulgate rules that

3 to the per capita cost of education for a similar period in such
4 district during the preceding year has been paid to the receiving

7 Board of Education discovers that the attendance has been allowed
8 without prior payment of the tuition fee in advance as required, no
9 further payment of any State Aid funds shall be made to the district
10 until the district has shown to the satisfaction of the State Board

12 will no longer be allowed to attend school until the required
13 tuition fee has been paid.
14 2. The provisions of paragraph 1 of this subsection shall not
15 apply to a school district that enrolls nonresident students from a
