defendant until the defendant has presented proof to

domestic abuse by an individual licensed practitioner
or a domestic abuse treatment program certified by the
Attorney General and attendance at weekly sessions of
such program. Such proof shall be presented to the
court by the defendant no later than one hundred
twenty (120) days after the defendant is ordered to
such counseling or treatment. At such time, the court
may complete sentencing, beginning the period of the

sentence from the date that proof of enrollment is
presented to the court, and schedule reviews as
required by subparagraphs a and b of this paragraph
and paragraphs 4 and 5 of this subsection. Three
unexcused absences in succession or seven unexcused
absences in a period of fifty-two (52) weeks from any
court-ordered domestic abuse counseling or treatment
program shall be prima facie evidence of the violation

defendant to any or all remaining portions of the original sentence;

the same manner and procedure as set forth in Sections 1-8-103 and
