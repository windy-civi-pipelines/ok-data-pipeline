WHEREAS, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a chronic cardiac
14
15
disease involving the thickening of the heart muscle that can
15
16
potentially lead to debilitating symptoms and serious complications,
16
17
including heart failure, atrial fibrillation, stroke, and in rare
17
18
cases sudden cardiac death; and
18
19
WHEREAS, HCM is the most common inheritable heart disease and
19
20
can affect anyone regardless of age, gender, or ethnicity with a
20
21
reported prevalence ranging from one in 200 to one in 500 in the
21
22
general population; and
22
23
WHEREAS, an estimated 700,000 to 1,650,000 people in the United

Req. No. 1777 Page 1

1
WHEREAS, HCM shares symptoms with other common cardiovascular
1
2
and pulmonary diseases, such as shortness of breath, chest pain,
2
3
fatigue, palpitations, and fainting, making it difficult to
3
4
distinguish HCM from other diseases; and
4
5
WHEREAS, when untreated, the all-cause mortality risk is three
5
6
to four times higher in patients with HCM than that of the general
6
7
population; and
7
8
WHEREAS, knowing oneâ€™s medical history and any signs and
8
9
symptoms of HCM is an important first step in receiving an accurate
9
10
diagnosis of HCM; and
10
11
WHEREAS, a health care provider must conduct a thorough
11
12
screening with cardiac health questions to help identify a risk of
12
13
cardiac disorders, both genetic and congenital; and
13
14
WHEREAS, a health care provider may conduct several tests,
14
15
including an echocardiogram, a cardiac MRI, or genetic testing to
15
16
confirm a family history of HCM, and must examine the heart to
16
17
diagnose HCM; and
17
18
WHEREAS, following a diagnosis of HCM, it is important for the
18
19
patient to work with his or her health care provider to learn more
19
20
about the disease and understand different management options,
20
21
including prescription medicines and surgical treatments that may
21
22
help; and
22
23
WHEREAS, the fourth Wednesday in February is an appropriate day
23
24
to observe Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Awareness Day.
