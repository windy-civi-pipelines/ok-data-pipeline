A Resolution declaring the fourth Wednesday in
Awareness Day; acknowledging the importance of
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) awareness to
improve cardiovascular health; supporting awareness
of the consequences of untreated HCM and the need to
seek appropriate care; requesting the Governor to
annually issue a proclamation recognizing
Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Awareness Day; and
calling upon the people of this state to observe the
day.
WHEREAS, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a chronic cardiac
disease involving the thickening of the heart muscle that can
potentially lead to debilitating symptoms and serious complications,
including heart failure, atrial fibrillation, stroke, and in rare
cases sudden cardiac death; and
WHEREAS, HCM is the most common inheritable heart disease and
can affect anyone regardless of age, gender, or ethnicity with a
reported prevalence ranging from one in 200 to one in 500 in the
general population; and
WHEREAS, an estimated 700,000 to 1,650,000 people in the United
States have HCM, yet 85% of them may remain undiagnosed; and
WHEREAS, HCM shares symptoms with other common cardiovascular
and pulmonary diseases, such as shortness of breath, chest pain,
fatigue, palpitations, and fainting, making it difficult to
distinguish HCM from other diseases; and
WHEREAS, when untreated, the all-cause mortality risk is three
to four times higher in patients with HCM than that of the general
population; and
WHEREAS, knowing one’s medical history and any signs and
symptoms of HCM is an important first step in receiving an accurate
diagnosis of HCM; and
WHEREAS, a health care provider must conduct a thorough
screening with cardiac health questions to help identify a risk of
cardiac disorders, both genetic and congenital; and
WHEREAS, a health care provider may conduct several tests,
including an echocardiogram, a cardiac MRI, or genetic testing to
confirm a family history of HCM, and must examine the heart to
diagnose HCM; and
WHEREAS, following a diagnosis of HCM, it is important for the
patient to work with his or her health care provider to learn more
about the disease and understand different management options,
including prescription medicines and surgical treatments that may
help; and
WHEREAS, the fourth Wednesday in February is an appropriate day
to observe Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Awareness Day.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE OF THE 1ST SESSION
OF THE 60TH OKLAHOMA LEGISLATURE:
ENR. S. R. NO. 2 Page 2
THAT the Senate declares the fourth Wednesday in February of
each year as Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Awareness Day in the State
