the court, the full and complete autopsy report in question may be
withheld until the court has issued a ruling on the requested
extension of time to release the autopsy report. Such requests for

of a law enforcement officer.

Section 57:
5. In the event that six (6) months have expired from the date
of the initial release of the autopsy report without any person
being criminally charged in the case in question and release of the
autopsy or portions of the autopsy have been denied on the grounds
ENR. H. B. NO. 2013 Page 11
of materially compromising a criminal investigation, an appeal of
such denial may be made to the appropriate district court. Courts
considering appeals for temporarily withholding an autopsy report
shall conduct a hearing and consider whether the interests of the
public outweigh the interests asserted by the district attorney or
law enforcement agency. In response to such appeals, the district
court shall order that the autopsy report be made available for
public inspection and copying with no redaction, or shall order an
extension of time during which the autopsy report may be withheld
under the provisions of this section.

Section 58:
6. Any court order obtained pursuant to this subsection shall
be served upon the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner by the party
requesting or granted the extension by the court.
H. An order granting an extension of time shall be applicable
to the autopsy report for the duration of the extension; provided,
each subsequent time extension shall only be ordered by the district
court for an additional twelve-month period of time or less and
cumulative time extensions shall not exceed four (4) years and six
(6) months; provided, charges being filed against a person in the
case in question or an autopsy report being entered into evidence as
part of a criminal prosecution nullifies any granted extension of
time.
I. The opportunities to withhold an autopsy report or portions
of an autopsy report provided in this section shall expire in
totality four (4) years and six (6) months after the date the
autopsy report was generated, at which time the autopsy report
previously withheld on the grounds provided for in this section
shall be made available for public inspection and copying.
J. Nothing in this section shall prohibit a district attorney
or law enforcement agency with authority to make a criminal
investigation in connection with the death from immediately
releasing portions of information contained in the full and complete
autopsy report for the purposes of assisting with the criminal
investigation or apprehension of any person involved in a criminal
act that resulted in the death of another person.
K. After ten (10) business days from the release of the full
and complete report, nothing in this section shall prohibit the
spouse of the deceased or any person related within two (2) degrees
of consanguinity to the deceased who has received a copy of the full
and complete autopsy report from the Office of the Chief Medical
ENR. H. B. NO. 2013 Page 12
Examiner from authorizing the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner's
office to release the full and complete autopsy report to any other
person subject to approval by the court.
L. When an autopsy of the body is conducted of a deceased human
who has epilepsy or a history of seizures, the report shall include
an investigation and determination as to whether the deceased
suffered a sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). In the
event the deceased did suffer a sudden unexpected death in epilepsy,
such information shall be noted on the death certificate and be
reported to the North American SUDEP Registry (NASR).

ENR. H. B. NO. 2013 Page 8

Section 945. A. When properly authorized, an autopsy shall be
performed by the Chief Medical Examiner or such person as may be
designated by him or her for such purpose. The Chief Medical
Examiner or a person designated by him or her may authorize arterial
embalming of the body prior to the autopsy when such embalming would
in his or her opinion not interfere with the autopsy. The extent of
the autopsy shall be made as is deemed necessary by the person
performing the autopsy.
B. A full and complete report of the facts developed by the
autopsy together with the findings of the person making it shall be
prepared and filed in the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner
without unnecessary delay. Copies of such reports and findings
shall be furnished to district attorneys and law enforcement
officers making a criminal investigation in connection with the
death.
C. Upon receiving a written, signed and dated records request,
a copy of the full and complete report of the facts developed by the
autopsy, together with the findings of the person making the report,
shall be released by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner to the
public in the most expedient manner available or as requested by the
records requester and, under the following conditions, shall be
furnished to:
1. District attorneys and any law enforcement agency with
authority to make a criminal investigation in connection with the
death; provided, such copies shall not be shared with any other
entity unless otherwise provided by law;
2. The spouse of the deceased or any person related within two
(2) degrees of consanguinity to the deceased, unless the district
attorney or law enforcement agency making a criminal investigation
objects to the release of documents to any family member. District
attorneys and law enforcement agencies shall be prohibited from
objecting to the release of the full and complete autopsy report to
the family if the decedent was in state custody, in custody of law
enforcement or is deceased due to lethal action of a law enforcement
officer; and
3. Any insurance company conducting an insurer's investigation
of any insurance claim arising from the death of the individual upon
whom the autopsy was performed.
ENR. H. B. NO. 2013 Page 9

D. The full and complete report of the facts developed by the
autopsy, together with the findings of the person making the report,
shall be withheld from public inspection and copying for ten (10)
business days following the date the report is generated by the
Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, except as provided for in
subsection C of this section.
E. The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner shall produce a
summary report of investigation by the medical examiner at the same
time the full and complete report of the facts developed by the
autopsy, together with the findings of the person making the report,
is released to the parties listed in subsection C of this section.
The summary report of investigation shall be made available for
public inspection and copying without delay. Any person may obtain
a copy of the summary report of investigation in the most expedient
manner available or as requested by the records requester.
F. The summary report of investigation shall include, but not
be limited to, the following information, if known:
1. Decedent name, age, birth date, race, sex, home address,
examiner notified by name and title and including date and time,
location where decedent was injured or became ill, including name of
facility, address, city, county, type of premises, date and time;
location of death including name of facility, city, county, type of
premises, date and time, and location body was viewed by medical
examiner including address, city, county, type of premises and date
and time;
2. If the death was a motor vehicle accident, whether the
decedent was the driver, passenger or pedestrian, and the type of
vehicle involved in the accident;
3. A description of the body, including but not limited to the
external physical examination, rigor, livor, external observations
including hair, eye color, body length and weight, and other
external observations, as well as the presence and location of
blood; and
4. The probable cause of death, other significant conditions
contributing to the death but not resulting in the underlying cause
given, manner of death, case disposition, case number, and name and
contact information of the medical examiner performing the autopsy,
including a signature and certification statement that the facts
ENR. H. B. NO. 2013 Page 10

contained in the report are true and correct to the best of their
knowledge and the date the report was signed and generated.
G. At the conclusion of the ten (10) business-day-period, the
full and complete report shall be made available as a public record
except when a district attorney or law enforcement agency with
authority to make a criminal investigation in connection with the
death declares that the full and complete report contains
information that would materially compromise an ongoing criminal
investigation. Such declaration shall be in writing to the Office
of the Medical Examiner and be an open record available from the
Office of Medical Examiner.
1. Upon such declaration, the district attorney or law
enforcement agency shall request from the appropriate district court
a hearing for an extension of time during which the full and
complete autopsy report, not including information in the summary
report, may be withheld.
2. When a request for an extension of time has been filed with
the court, the full and complete autopsy report in question may be
withheld until the court has issued a ruling on the requested
extension of time to release the autopsy report. Such requests for
an extension of time during which the autopsy may be withheld shall
be made on the grounds that release of the full and complete autopsy
report will materially compromise an ongoing criminal investigation.
3. Courts considering such requests shall conduct a hearing and
consider whether the interests of the public outweigh the interests
asserted by the district attorney or law enforcement agency.
4. If an extension of time is granted by the court, the initial
extension shall be ordered by the court for a period of six (6)
months. Subsequent extensions shall only be ordered after a hearing
by the court for an additional one year and cumulative time
extensions shall not exceed more than four (4) years and six (6)
months; provided, under no circumstance shall an extension of time
be granted by the court if the deceased person was in state custody,
in custody of law enforcement or was deceased due to lethal action
of a law enforcement officer.
5. In the event that six (6) months have expired from the date
of the initial release of the autopsy report without any person
being criminally charged in the case in question and release of the
autopsy or portions of the autopsy have been denied on the grounds
ENR. H. B. NO. 2013 Page 11

of materially compromising a criminal investigation, an appeal of
such denial may be made to the appropriate district court. Courts
considering appeals for temporarily withholding an autopsy report
shall conduct a hearing and consider whether the interests of the
public outweigh the interests asserted by the district attorney or
law enforcement agency. In response to such appeals, the district
court shall order that the autopsy report be made available for
public inspection and copying with no redaction, or shall order an
extension of time during which the autopsy report may be withheld
under the provisions of this section.
6. Any court order obtained pursuant to this subsection shall
be served upon the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner by the party
requesting or granted the extension by the court.
H. An order granting an extension of time shall be applicable
to the autopsy report for the duration of the extension; provided,
each subsequent time extension shall only be ordered by the district
court for an additional twelve-month period of time or less and
cumulative time extensions shall not exceed four (4) years and six
(6) months; provided, charges being filed against a person in the
case in question or an autopsy report being entered into evidence as
part of a criminal prosecution nullifies any granted extension of
time.
I. The opportunities to withhold an autopsy report or portions
of an autopsy report provided in this section shall expire in
totality four (4) years and six (6) months after the date the
autopsy report was generated, at which time the autopsy report
previously withheld on the grounds provided for in this section
shall be made available for public inspection and copying.
J. Nothing in this section shall prohibit a district attorney
or law enforcement agency with authority to make a criminal
investigation in connection with the death from immediately
releasing portions of information contained in the full and complete
autopsy report for the purposes of assisting with the criminal
investigation or apprehension of any person involved in a criminal
act that resulted in the death of another person.
K. After ten (10) business days from the release of the full
and complete report, nothing in this section shall prohibit the
spouse of the deceased or any person related within two (2) degrees
of consanguinity to the deceased who has received a copy of the full
and complete autopsy report from the Office of the Chief Medical
ENR. H. B. NO. 2013 Page 12

Examiner from authorizing the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner's
office to release the full and complete autopsy report to any other
person subject to approval by the court.
L. When an autopsy of the body is conducted of a deceased human
who has epilepsy or a history of seizures, the report shall include
an investigation and determination as to whether the deceased
suffered a sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). In the
event the deceased did suffer a sudden unexpected death in epilepsy,
such information shall be noted on the death certificate and be
reported to the North American SUDEP Registry (NASR).
SECTION 6. This act shall become effective November 1, 2025.
