7 of materially compromising a criminal investigation, an appeal of
8 such denial may be made to the appropriate district court. Courts
9 considering appeals for temporarily withholding an autopsy report
10 shall conduct a hearing and consider whether the interests of the
11 public outweigh the interests asserted by the district attorney or
12 law enforcement agency. In response to such appeals, the district
13 court shall order that the autopsy report be made available for
14 public inspection and copying with no redaction, or shall order an
15 extension of time during which the autopsy report may be withheld

6 of an autopsy report provided in this section shall expire in
7 totality four (4) years and six (6) months after the date the
8 autopsy report was generated, at which time the autopsy report

16 investigation or apprehension of any person involved in a criminal
17 act that resulted in the death of another person.

8 such denial may be made to the appropriate district court. Courts
9 considering appeals for temporarily withholding an autopsy report
10 shall conduct a hearing and consider whether the interests of the
11 public outweigh the interests asserted by the district attorney or
12 law enforcement agency. In response to such appeals, the district
13 court shall order that the autopsy report be made available for

16 investigation or apprehension of any person involved in a criminal
17 act that resulted in the death of another person.
18 K. After ten (10) business days from the release of the full
