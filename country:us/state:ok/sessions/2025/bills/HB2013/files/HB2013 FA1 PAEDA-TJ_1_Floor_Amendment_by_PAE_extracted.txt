14 of the initial release of the autopsy report without any person
15 being criminally charged in the case in question and release of the
16 autopsy or portions of the autopsy have been denied on the grounds
17 of materially compromising a criminal investigation, an appeal of
18 such denial may be made to the appropriate district court. Courts
19 considering appeals for temporarily withholding an autopsy report
20 shall conduct a hearing and consider whether the interests of the
21 public outweigh the interests asserted by the district attorney or
22 law enforcement agency. In response to such appeals, the district
23 court shall order that the autopsy report be made available for
24 public inspection and copying with no redaction, or shall order an

8 each subsequent time extension shall only be ordered by the district
9 court for an additional twelve-month period of time or less and
10 cumulative time extensions shall not exceed four (4) years and six
11 (6) months; provided, charges being filed against a person in the
12 case in question or an autopsy report being entered into evidence as
13 part of a criminal prosecution nullifies any granted extension of
14 time.
15 I. The opportunities to withhold an autopsy report or portions
16 of an autopsy report provided in this section shall expire in
17 totality four (4) years and six (6) months after the date the
18 autopsy report was generated, at which time the autopsy report
19 previously withheld on the grounds provided for in this section
20 shall be made available for public inspection and copying.
21 J. Nothing in this section shall prohibit a district attorney
22 or law enforcement agency with authority to make a criminal
23 investigation in connection with the death from immediately
24 releasing portions of information contained in the full and complete
Req. No. 13327 Page 18
1 auto psy report for the purposes of assisting with the criminal
2 investigation or apprehension of any person involved in a criminal
3 act that resulted in the death of another person.
4 K. After ten (10) business days from the release of the full
5 and complete report, nothing in this section shall prohibit the

7 of consanguinity to the deceased who has received a copy of the full
8 and complete autopsy report from the Office of the Chief Medical
9 Examiner from authorizing the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner's
10 office to release the full and complete autopsy report to any other
11 person subject to approval by the court.

18 such denial may be made to the appropriate district court. Courts
19 considering appeals for temporarily withholding an autopsy report
20 shall conduct a hearing and consider whether the interests of the
21 public outweigh the interests asserted by the district attorney or
22 law enforcement agency. In response to such appeals, the district

16 of an autopsy report provided in this section shall expire in
17 totality four (4) years and six (6) months after the date the

19 previously withheld on the grounds provided for in this section
20 shall be made available for public inspection and copying.

1 auto psy report for the purposes of assisting with the criminal
2 investigation or apprehension of any person involved in a criminal
3 act that resulted in the death of another person.
