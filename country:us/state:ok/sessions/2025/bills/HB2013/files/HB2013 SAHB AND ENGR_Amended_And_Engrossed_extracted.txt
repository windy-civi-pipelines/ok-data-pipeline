20 G. At the conclusion of the ten (10) business-day-period, the
21 full and complete report shall be made available as a public record
22 except when a district attorney or law enforcement agency with
23 authority to make a criminal investigation in connection with the
24 death declares that the full and complete report contains
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2013 Page 15
1 info rmation that would materially compromise an ongoing criminal
2 investigation. Such declaration shall be in writing to the Office
3 of the Medical Examiner and be an open record available from the
4 Office of Medical Examiner.
5 1. Upon such declaration, the district attorney or law
6 enforcement agency shall request from the appropriate district court

8 complete autopsy report, not including information in the summary
9 report, may be withheld.
10 2. When a request for an extension of time has been filed with
11 the court, the full and complete autopsy report in question may be
12 withheld until the court has issued a ruling on the requested
13 extension of time to release the autopsy report. Such requests for
14 an extension of time during which the autopsy may be withheld shall
15 be made on the grounds that release of the full and complete autopsy
16 report will materially compromise an ongoing criminal investigation.
17 3. Courts considering such requests shall conduct a hearing and
18 consider whether the interests of the public outweigh the interests
19 asserted by the district attorney or law enforcement agency.
20 4. If an extension of time is granted by the court, the initial
21 extension shall be ordered by the court for a period of six (6)
22 months. Subsequent extensions shall only be ordered after a hearing

24 extensions shall not exceed more than four (4) years and six (6)
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2013 Page 16
1 mont hs; provided, under no circumstance shall an extension of time
2 be granted by the court if the deceased person was in state custody,
3 in custody of law enforcement or was deceased due to lethal action
4 of a law enforcement officer.
5 5. In the event that six (6) months have expired from the date
6 of the initial release of the autopsy report without any person
7 being criminally charged in the case in question and release of the
8 autopsy or portions of the autopsy have been denied on the grounds
9 of materially compromising a criminal investigation, an appeal of
10 such denial may be made to the appropriate district court. Courts
11 considering appeals for temporarily withholding an autopsy report
12 shall conduct a hearing and consider whether the interests of the
13 public outweigh the interests asserted by the district attorney or
14 law enforcement agency. In response to such appeals, the district
15 court shall order that the autopsy report be made available for
16 public inspection and copying with no redaction, or shall order an
17 extension of time during which the autopsy report may be withheld
18 under the provisions of this section.
19 6. Any court order obtained pursuant to this subsection shall
20 be served upon the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner by the party
21 requesting or granted the extension by the court.
22 H. An order granting an extension of time shall be applicable
23 to the autopsy report for the duration of the extension; provided,
24 each subsequent time extension shall only be ordered by the district
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2013 Page 17
1 cour t for an additional twelve-month period of time or less and
2 cumulative time extensions shall not exceed four (4) years and six
3 (6) months; provided, charges being filed against a person in the
4 case in question or an autopsy report being entered into evidence as
5 part of a criminal prosecution nullifies any granted extension of
6 time.
7 I. The opportunities to withhold an autopsy report or portions
8 of an autopsy report provided in this section shall expire in
9 totality four (4) years and six (6) months after the date the
10 autopsy report was generated, at which time the autopsy report
11 previously withheld on the grounds provided for in this section
12 shall be made available for public inspection and copying.
13 J. Nothing in this section shall prohibit a district attorney
14 or law enforcement agency with authority to make a criminal
15 investigation in connection with the death from immediately
16 releasing portions of information contained in the full and complete
17 autopsy report for the purposes of assisting with the criminal
18 investigation or apprehension of any person involved in a criminal
19 act that resulted in the death of another person.
20 K. After ten (10) business days from the release of the full
21 and complete report, nothing in this section shall prohibit the
22 spouse of the deceased or any person related within two (2) degrees
23 of consanguinity to the deceased who has received a copy of the full
24 and complete autopsy report from the Office of the Chief Medical
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2013 Page 18

20 G. At the conclusion of the ten (10) business-day-period, the
21 full and complete report shall be made available as a public record

23 authority to make a criminal investigation in connection with the
24 death declares that the full and complete report contains
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2013 Page 15

1 info rmation that would materially compromise an ongoing criminal
2 investigation. Such declaration shall be in writing to the Office
3 of the Medical Examiner and be an open record available from the
4 Office of Medical Examiner.

9 report, may be withheld.
10 2. When a request for an extension of time has been filed with
11 the court, the full and complete autopsy report in question may be
12 withheld until the court has issued a ruling on the requested
13 extension of time to release the autopsy report. Such requests for
14 an extension of time during which the autopsy may be withheld shall
15 be made on the grounds that release of the full and complete autopsy
16 report will materially compromise an ongoing criminal investigation.

18 consider whether the interests of the public outweigh the interests
19 asserted by the district attorney or law enforcement agency.
20 4. If an extension of time is granted by the court, the initial
21 extension shall be ordered by the court for a period of six (6)
22 months. Subsequent extensions shall only be ordered after a hearing
23 by the court for an additional one year and cumulative time
24 extensions shall not exceed more than four (4) years and six (6)
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2013 Page 16

1 mont hs; provided, under no circumstance shall an extension of time
2 be granted by the court if the deceased person was in state custody,
3 in custody of law enforcement or was deceased due to lethal action
4 of a law enforcement officer.
5 5. In the event that six (6) months have expired from the date
6 of the initial release of the autopsy report without any person
7 being criminally charged in the case in question and release of the
8 autopsy or portions of the autopsy have been denied on the grounds
9 of materially compromising a criminal investigation, an appeal of
10 such denial may be made to the appropriate district court. Courts
11 considering appeals for temporarily withholding an autopsy report
12 shall conduct a hearing and consider whether the interests of the
13 public outweigh the interests asserted by the district attorney or
14 law enforcement agency. In response to such appeals, the district
15 court shall order that the autopsy report be made available for
16 public inspection and copying with no redaction, or shall order an
17 extension of time during which the autopsy report may be withheld
18 under the provisions of this section.
19 6. Any court order obtained pursuant to this subsection shall
20 be served upon the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner by the party
21 requesting or granted the extension by the court.
22 H. An order granting an extension of time shall be applicable
23 to the autopsy report for the duration of the extension; provided,
24 each subsequent time extension shall only be ordered by the district
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2013 Page 17

1 cour t for an additional twelve-month period of time or less and
2 cumulative time extensions shall not exceed four (4) years and six
3 (6) months; provided, charges being filed against a person in the
4 case in question or an autopsy report being entered into evidence as
5 part of a criminal prosecution nullifies any granted extension of
6 time.
7 I. The opportunities to withhold an autopsy report or portions
8 of an autopsy report provided in this section shall expire in
9 totality four (4) years and six (6) months after the date the
10 autopsy report was generated, at which time the autopsy report
11 previously withheld on the grounds provided for in this section
12 shall be made available for public inspection and copying.
13 J. Nothing in this section shall prohibit a district attorney
14 or law enforcement agency with authority to make a criminal
15 investigation in connection with the death from immediately
16 releasing portions of information contained in the full and complete
17 autopsy report for the purposes of assisting with the criminal
18 investigation or apprehension of any person involved in a criminal
19 act that resulted in the death of another person.
20 K. After ten (10) business days from the release of the full
21 and complete report, nothing in this section shall prohibit the
22 spouse of the deceased or any person related within two (2) degrees
23 of consanguinity to the deceased who has received a copy of the full
24 and complete autopsy report from the Office of the Chief Medical
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2013 Page 18
