6 such denial may be made to the appropriate district court. Courts
7 considering appeals for temporarily withholding an autopsy report
8 shall conduct a hearing and consider whether the interests of the
9 public outweigh the interests asserted by the district attorney or
10 law enforcement agency. In response to such appeals, the district
11 court shall order that the autopsy report be made available for

14 investigation or apprehension of any person involved in a criminal
15 act that resulted in the death of another person.
16 K. After ten (10) business days from the release of the full
17 and complete report, nothing in this section shall prohibit the
