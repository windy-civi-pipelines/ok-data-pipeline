19 of a law enforcement officer.

21 of the initial release of the autopsy report without any person
22 being criminally charged in the case in question and release of the
23 autopsy or portions of the autopsy have been denied on the grounds
24 of materially compromising a criminal investigation, an appeal of
Req. No. 12693 Page 19
1 such denial may be made to the appropriate district court. Courts
2 considering appeals for temporarily withholding an autopsy report
3 shall conduct a hearing and consider whether the interests of the
4 public outweigh the interests asserted by the district attorney or
5 law enforcement agency. In response to such appeals, the district
6 court shall order that the autopsy report be made available for
7 public inspection and copying with no redaction, or shall order an
8 extension of time during which the autopsy report may be withheld
9 under the provisions of this section.

11 be served upon the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner by the party
12 requesting or granted the extension by the court.

14 to the autopsy report for the duration of the extension; provided,
15 each subsequent time extension shall only be ordered by the district
16 court for an additional twelve-month period of time or less and
17 cumulative time extensions shall not exceed four (4) years and six
18 (6) months; provided, charges being filed against a person in the
19 case in question or an autopsy report being entered into evidence as
20 part of a criminal prosecution nullifies any granted extension of
21 time.
22 I. The opportunities to withhold an autopsy report or portions
23 of an autopsy report provided in this section shall expire in

22 a hearing for an extension of time during which the full and
23 complete autopsy report, not including information in the summary
24 report, may be withheld.
Req. No. 12693 Page 18

1 2. When a request for an extension of time has been filed with
2 the court, the full and complete autopsy report in question may be
3 withheld until the court has issued a ruling on the requested
4 extension of time to release the autopsy report. Such requests for
5 an extension of time during which the autopsy may be withheld shall
6 be made on the grounds that release of the full and complete autopsy
7 report will materially compromise an ongoing criminal investigation.
8 3. Courts considering such requests shall conduct a hearing and
9 consider whether the interests of the public outweigh the interests
10 asserted by the district attorney or law enforcement agency.
11 4. If an extension of time is granted by the court, the initial
12 extension shall be ordered by the court for a period of six (6)
13 months. Subsequent extensions shall only be ordered after a hearing
14 by the court for an additional one year and cumulative time
15 extensions shall not exceed more than four (4) years and six (6)
16 months; provided, under no circumstance shall an extension of time
17 be granted by the court if the deceased person was in state custody,
18 in custody of law enforcement or was deceased due to lethal action
19 of a law enforcement officer.
20 5. In the event that six (6) months have expired from the date
21 of the initial release of the autopsy report without any person
22 being criminally charged in the case in question and release of the
23 autopsy or portions of the autopsy have been denied on the grounds
24 of materially compromising a criminal investigation, an appeal of
Req. No. 12693 Page 19

1 such denial may be made to the appropriate district court. Courts
2 considering appeals for temporarily withholding an autopsy report
3 shall conduct a hearing and consider whether the interests of the
4 public outweigh the interests asserted by the district attorney or
5 law enforcement agency. In response to such appeals, the district
6 court shall order that the autopsy report be made available for
7 public inspection and copying with no redaction, or shall order an
8 extension of time during which the autopsy report may be withheld
9 under the provisions of this section.
10 6. Any court order obtained pursuant to this subsection shall
11 be served upon the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner by the party
12 requesting or granted the extension by the court.
13 H. An order granting an extension of time shall be applicable
14 to the autopsy report for the duration of the extension; provided,
15 each subsequent time extension shall only be ordered by the district
16 court for an additional twelve-month period of time or less and
17 cumulative time extensions shall not exceed four (4) years and six
18 (6) months; provided, charges being filed against a person in the
19 case in question or an autopsy report being entered into evidence as
20 part of a criminal prosecution nullifies any granted extension of
21 time.
22 I. The opportunities to withhold an autopsy report or portions
23 of an autopsy report provided in this section shall expire in
24 totality four (4) years and six (6) months after the date the
Req. No. 12693 Page 20

1 auto psy report was generated, at which time the autopsy report
2 previously withheld on the grounds provided for in this section
3 shall be made available for public inspection and copying.
4 J. Nothing in this section shall prohibit a district attorney
5 or law enforcement agency with authority to make a criminal
6 investigation in connection with the death from immediately
7 releasing portions of information contained in the full and complete
8 autopsy report for the purposes of assisting with the criminal
9 investigation or apprehension of any person involved in a criminal
10 act that resulted in the death of another person.
11 K. After ten (10) business days from the release of the full
12 and complete report, nothing in this section shall prohibit the
13 spouse of the deceased or any person related within two (2) degrees
14 of consanguinity to the deceased who has received a copy of the full
15 and complete autopsy report from the Office of the Chief Medical
16 Examiner from authorizing the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner's
17 office to release the full and complete autopsy report to any other
18 person subject to approval by the court.
19 L. When an autopsy of the body is conducted of a deceased human
20 who has epilepsy or a history of seizures, the report shall include
21 an investigation and determination as to whether the deceased
22 suffered a sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). In the
23 event the deceased did suffer a sudden unexpected death in epilepsy,
24
Req. No. 12693 Page 21

1 such information shall be noted on the death certificate and be
2 reported to the North American SUDEP Registry (NASR).
3 SECTION 8. This act shall become effective November 1, 2025.
