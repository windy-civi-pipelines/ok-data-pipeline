a. a municipal resolution finding that the marijuana
1
2
dispensary is located within the prohibited setback
2
3
distance from a school that was openly in existence in
3
4
such a way that the public generally would have known
4
5
of the school’s existence and operation in that
5
6
location prior to the original marijuana dispensary
6
7
being licensed. For purposes of this subparagraph,
7
8
“openly in existence” means any building, location or
8
9
structure on a school site that has visible outward
9
10
markings indicating the building, location or
10
11
structure was operating as a school which would serve
11
12
as sufficient notice of the existence of the school or
12
13
a reason for further inquiry on the part of the
13
14
marijuana dispensary license applicant. Openly in
14
15
existence shall not mean any school that operated
15
16
secretly or discreetly without any signs or other
16
17
markings on any building, location or structure on the
17
18
school site, undeveloped land or a structure owned by
18
19
a school that was not openly used and marked as a
19
20
school site, or any school site that was established
20
21
after the marijuana dispensary had been established
21
22
and licensed by the Authority, and
22
23
b. documentation of the measured distance from the school
23
24
to the marijuana dispensary utilizing the method for

error in measurement calculated and remeasured on and

3
after the effective date of this act as authorized by

4
Section 425 of this title.

5
6
receipt of documentation required by paragraph 3 of this subsection,
6
7
if the Authority determines that the medical marijuana dispensary is
7
8
operating contrary to the required setback distance from a school
8
9
including the error in measurement allowance authorized by Section
9
10
425 of this title, the Authority may deny the renewal or transfer of
10
11
the medical marijuana dispensary license and shall cause the license
11
12
to be revoked.
12
13
5. For purposes of this subsection, “school” means the same as
13
14
defined in Section 427.2 of this title.
14
15
Once a certificate of occupancy has been submitted to the
15
16
Oklahoma Medical Marijuana Authority showing full compliance as
16
17
outlined in this subsection, the licensee shall only need to submit
17
18
an affidavit for license renewal stating the premises continues to
18
19
comply with zoning classifications, applicable municipal ordinances,
19
20
and all applicable safety, electrical, fire, plumbing, waste,
20
21
construction, and building specification codes. An additional
21
22
certificate of occupancy along with an affidavit shall be submitted
22
23
if a change of use or occupancy occurs, or there is any change
23
24
concerning the facility or location that would, by law, require
24
Req. No. 1126 Page 5

1
additional inspection, licensure or permitting by the state or
1
2
municipality. Municipalities or the State Fire Marshal may
2
3
implement an inspection program to verify compliance with this
3
4
subsection. The Authority shall promulgate the rules necessary for
4
5
the affidavit provided in this subsection. If an application for
5
6
renewal is submitted in violation of the provisions of this
6
7
subsection or information provided on the affidavit is inaccurate or
7
8
untrue, the Authority shall suspend operations of the licensee’s
8
9
premises until compliance is reestablished. All existing medical
9
10
marijuana business licensees and registrants that do not possess a
10
11
valid certificate of occupancy, where required, shall be subject to
11
12
revocation until such time as a valid certificate of occupancy is
12
13
obtained for all applicable structures. This provision shall not
13
14
apply to medical marijuana business licensees and registrants who
14
15
submitted a full and complete application for a valid certificate of
15
16
occupancy to the State Fire Marshal or political subdivision with an
16
17
authority having a jurisdiction agreement on file with the State
17
18
Fire Marshal before February 1, 2024, and while the same application
18
19
remains under review by the State Fire Marshal or political
19
20
subdivision. Medical marijuana business licensees and registrants
20
21
are responsible for compliance with applicable state fire, building,
21
22
and electrical codes and may be liable for all damage that results
22
23
from noncompliance with state fire, building, and electrical codes
23
24
to the extent authorized by law.
