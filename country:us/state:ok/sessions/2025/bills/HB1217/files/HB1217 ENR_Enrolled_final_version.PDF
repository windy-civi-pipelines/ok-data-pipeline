participate or take part in any event shall be exempt from the
provisions of this section.
B. 1. It shall be unlawful for a person to engage in an adult
performance which contains obscene material, or for any political
subdivision of this state to allow, permit, organize, or authorize
the viewing of an adult performance which contains obscene material,
on public property or in a public place where a minor, as part of
the general public, will be exposed to view such adult performance.
2. A political subdivision acting in good faith in accordance
with the requirements of this subsection shall not be liable for the
acts of an individual or group in violation of this subsection.

of this section.
