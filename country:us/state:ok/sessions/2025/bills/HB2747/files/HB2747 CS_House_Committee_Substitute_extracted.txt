2 amended to read as follows:
3 Section 286. A. 1. The portion of costs incurred by an
4 electric utility, which is subject to rate regulation by the
5 Corporation Commission, for transmission upgrades approved by a
6 regional transmission organization to which the utility is a member
7 and resulting from an order of a federal regulatory authority having
8 legal jurisdiction over interstate regulation of transmission rates,
9 shall be presumed recoverable by the utility. The presumption
10 established in this paragraph may be rebutted by evidence that the
11 costs so incurred by the utility for the transmission upgrades
12 exceed the scope of the project authorized by the regional
13 transmission organization or order issued by the federal regulatory
14 authority having jurisdiction over interstate regulation of
15 transmission rates. The Commission shall transmit rules to
16 implement the requirements of this subsection to the Legislature on
17 or before April 1, 2006. The rules may authorize an electric
18 utility to periodically adjust its rates to recover all or a portion
19 of the costs so incurred by the utility for the transmission
20 upgrades.
21 2. Reasonable costs incurred by an electric utility for
22 transmission upgrades:
23 a. needed to develop wind generation in this state,
24 b. approved by the Southwest Power Pool, and
Req. No. 13216 Page 2
1 c. placed into service before December 31, 2013,
2 shall be presumed recoverable through a periodic adjustment in the
3 rates of the utility, provided that the presumption of the recovery
4 of such costs or the recovery of such costs through a periodic
5 adjustment in rates may be rebutted by evidence presented to the
6 Commission. The determination of whether the costs shall be
7 recovered and whether the costs shall be recovered through a
8 periodic adjustment of rates shall be made by the Commission
9 following proper notice and hearing in a cause to be filed by the
10 electric utility in which it files such information as the
11 Commission may require.
12 B. An electric utility subject to rate regulation by the
13 Corporation Commission may file an application seeking Commission
14 authorization of a plan by the utility to make capital expenditures
15 for equipment or facilities necessary to comply with the federal
16 Clean Air Act (CAA), the Clean Water Act (CWA), the Comprehensive
17 Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA),
18 the Emergency Planning & Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA), the
19 Endangered Species Act (ESA), the National Environmental Policy Act

24 amended, and, as the Commission may deem appropriate, federal,
Req. No. 13216 Page 3
1 stat e, local or tribal environmental requirements which apply to
2 generation facilities. If approved by the Commission, after notice
3 and hearing, the equipment or facilities specified in the approved
4 utility plan are conclusively presumed used and useful. The utility
5 may elect to periodically adjust its rates to recover the costs of
6 the expenditures. The utility shall file a request for a review of
7 its rates pursuant to Section 152 of this title no more than twenty-
8 four (24) months after the utility begins recovering the costs
9 through a periodic rate adjustment mechanism and no more than
10 twenty-four (24) months after the utility begins recovering the
11 costs through any subsequent periodic rate adjustment mechanism.
12 Provided further, that a periodic rate adjustment or adjustments are
13 not intended to prevent a utility from seeking cost recovery of
14 capital expenditures as otherwise may be authorized by the
15 Commission. However, the reasonableness of the costs to be
16 recovered by the utility shall be subject to Commission review and
17 approval. The Commission shall promulgate rules to implement the
18 provisions of this subsection, such rules to that shall be
19 transmitted to the Legislature on or before April 1, 2007.
20 C. 1. An electric utility subject to rate regulation by the
21 Corporation Commission may elect to file an application seeking
22 approval by the Commission to construct a new electric generating
23 facility, to purchase an existing electric generation facility or
24 enter into a long-term contract for purchased power and capacity
Req. No. 13216 Page 4
1 and/ or energy, subject to the provisions of this subsection. If,
2 and to the extent that, the Commission determines there is a need
3 for construction or purchase of the electric generating facility or
4 long-term purchase power contract, the generating facility or
5 contract shall be considered used and useful and its costs shall be
6 subject to cost recovery rules promulgated by the Commission. The
7 Commission shall enter an order on an application filed pursuant to
8 this subsection within two hundred forty (240) days of the filing of
9 the application, unless the generation facility utilizes natural gas
10 as its primary fuel source, following notice and hearing and after
11 consideration of reasonable alternatives. If the generation
12 facility uses natural gas as its primary fuel source, the Commission
13 shall enter an order on an application filed pursuant to this
14 subsection within one hundred eighty (180) days of the filing of the
15 application, following notice and hearing and after consideration of
16 the reasonable alternative.
17 2. Bids received by the utility through a competitive bidding
18 process within twelve (12) months following the final bid due date
19 of such competitive bidding process shall be considered substantial
20 evidence to satisfy the consideration of reasonable alternatives.
21 2. 3. Following receipt of an application filed pursuant to
22 this subsection, the Corporation Commission staff may file a request
23 to assess the specific costs, to be paid by the electric utility and
24 which shall be deemed to be recoverable, for the costs associated
Req. No. 13216 Page 5
1 with conducting the analysis or investigation of the application
2 including, but not limited to, the cost of acquiring expert
3 witnesses, consultants, and analytical services. The request shall
4 be filed at and heard by the Corporation Commissioners in the docket
5 opened by the electric utility pursuant to this subsection. After
6 notice and hearing, the Commission shall decide the request.
7 3. 4. Additionally, following receipt of an application filed
8 pursuant to this subsection, the Office of the Attorney General may
9 file a request with the Corporation Commission for the assessment of
10 specific costs, to be paid by the electric utility and which shall
11 be deemed to be recoverable, associated with the performance of the
12 Attorney General's duties as provided by law. Those costs may
13 include, but are not limited to, the cost of acquiring expert
14 witnesses, consultants and analytical services. The request shall
15 be filed at and heard by the Corporation Commissioners in the docket
16 opened by the electric utility pursuant to this subsection. After
17 notice and hearing, the Commission shall decide the request.
18 4. 5. The Commission shall promulgate rules to implement the
19 provisions of this subsection. The rules shall be transmitted to
20 the Legislature on or before April 1, 2006. In promulgating rules
21 to implement the provisions of this subsection, the Commission shall
22 consider, among other things, rules which would:
23 a. permit contemporaneous utility recovery from its
24 customers, the amount necessary to cover the
Req. No. 13216 Page 6
1 Corporation Commission staff and Attorney General
2 assessments as authorized by this subsection,
3 b. establish how the cost of facilities approved pursuant
4 to this subsection shall be timely reviewed, approved,
5 and recovered or disapproved, and
6 c. establish the information which an electric utility
7 must provide when filing an application pursuant to
8 this subsection.
9 5. 6. The Commission shall also consider rules which may permit
10 an electric utility to begin to recover return on or and return of
11 Construction-Work-In-Progress expenses prior to commercial operation
12 of a newly constructed electric generation facility subject to the
13 provisions of this subsection, provided the newly constructed
14 electric generation facility utilizes natural gas as its primary
15 fuel source. The Commission shall permit a separate rate adjustment
16 mechanism, adjusted periodically, to recover the costs described in
17 this section for new capacity in natural-gas-fired electrical
18 generation facilities. The new natural-gas-fired generation
19 capacity eligible for those provisions shall also include new
20 natural-gas-fired capacity additions at an existing electric
21 generation facility. If a public utility implements a rate
22 adjustment mechanism pursuant to this section and subsequently
23 terminates the initiative to construct or acquire a stake in a
24 natural gas generating facility, the Commission shall have the
Req. No. 13216 Page 7
1 auth ority, following notice and hearing, to order the public utility
2 to refund customers any amounts collected through such rate
3 adjustment mechanism. In ordering any such refund, the Commission
4 shall give consideration as to the circumstances resulting in the
5 termination of the construction or acquisition.
6 7. For any new natural gas fired generating facility
7 constructed pursuant to this section, an electric utility shall
8 secure a firm contract to transport natural gas to the generating
9 facility. Such a contract shall be secured pursuant to a
10 competitive solicitation process conducted in accordance with
11 applicable Commission rules. The cost incurred for such a contract
12 shall be presumed recoverable by the electric utility through its
13 applicable fuel adjustment clause. Costs assessed upon the electric
14 utility by the Commission for noncompliance with this section shall
15 not be recoverable from the electric utility's customers. In the
16 event that the electric utility does not receive a bid for firm
17 transportation as a result of its competitive solicitation, the
18 electric utility shall be considered compliant with the requirement
19 of this section; provided that the Commission determines that such
20 competitive solicitation is for a firm contract for transportation
21 of natural gas which could be reasonably provided by an available
22 pipeline.

17 this section for new capacity in natural-gas-fired electrical
18 generation facilities. The new natural-gas-fired generation
19 capacity eligible for those provisions shall also include new
20 natural-gas-fired capacity additions at an existing electric
21 generation facility. If a public utility implements a rate
22 adjustment mechanism pursuant to this section and subsequently
23 terminates the initiative to construct or acquire a stake in a
24 natural gas generating facility, the Commission shall have the
Req. No. 13216 Page 7

1 auth ority, following notice and hearing, to order the public utility
2 to refund customers any amounts collected through such rate
3 adjustment mechanism. In ordering any such refund, the Commission
4 shall give consideration as to the circumstances resulting in the
5 termination of the construction or acquisition.
6 7. For any new natural gas fired generating facility
7 constructed pursuant to this section, an electric utility shall
8 secure a firm contract to transport natural gas to the generating
9 facility. Such a contract shall be secured pursuant to a
10 competitive solicitation process conducted in accordance with
11 applicable Commission rules. The cost incurred for such a contract
12 shall be presumed recoverable by the electric utility through its
13 applicable fuel adjustment clause. Costs assessed upon the electric
14 utility by the Commission for noncompliance with this section shall
15 not be recoverable from the electric utility's customers. In the
16 event that the electric utility does not receive a bid for firm
17 transportation as a result of its competitive solicitation, the
18 electric utility shall be considered compliant with the requirement
19 of this section; provided that the Commission determines that such
20 competitive solicitation is for a firm contract for transportation
21 of natural gas which could be reasonably provided by an available
22 pipeline.

1 SECTION 2. NEW LAW A new section of law to be codified
2 in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 295 of Title 17, unless there is
3 created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:
4 A. Commencing on July 1, 2025, a public utility shall defer to
5 a regulatory asset ninety percent (90%) of all depreciation expense
6 and return associated with all qualifying electric plants recorded
7 to plant-in-service on the utility's books, provided the public
8 utility has submitted notice to the Commission of the public
9 utility's election to make such deferrals pursuant to this section.
10 A qualifying electric plant shall include all incremental electric
11 plants added to plant-in-service by a public utility since the
12 utility's last general rate case, except transmission facilities or
13 new electric generating units.
14 B. Such deferral shall begin on July 1, 2025, if the public
15 utility has notified the Commission of the public utility's election
16 to make such deferral by such date or shall begin on the date that
17 such election is made if such election is made after July 1, 2025.
18 C. The Commission shall conduct a prudence review of the
19 associated qualifying electric plant resulting in the regulatory
20 asset balances prior to moving such balances into the public
21 utility's rate base. The regulatory asset balances arising under
22 this section shall be adjusted to reflect any prudence disallowances
23 of the associated qualifying electric plant, following notice and
24 hearing, as ordered by the Commission.
Req. No. 13216 Page 9

1 D. In each general rate proceeding concluded after July 1,
2 2025, the balance of the regulatory asset as the end of the test
3 year shall be included in the public utility's rate base without any
4 offset, reduction, or adjustment based upon consideration of any
5 other factor with the regulatory asset balances arising from the
6 deferrals associated with the qualifying electric plant placed in
7 service after the end of the test year to be included in the rate
8 base in the next general rate proceeding, unless otherwise provided
9 in this section.
10 E. Parts of regulatory asset balances created under this
11 section that are not included in rate base shall accrue carrying
12 costs as the public utility's weighted average cost of capital, plus
13 applicable federal, state, and local income or excise taxes.
14 Regulatory asset balances arising under this section that are
15 included in the rate base shall be recovered through a twenty-year
16 amortization beginning on the date new rates reflecting such
17 amortization take effect.
18 F. Depreciation expense deferred under this section shall
19 account for any qualifying electric plant placed into service, less
20 any applicable retirements. Returns deferred under this section
21 shall be determined using the weighted average cost of capital
22 approved by the Commission in the public utility's last general rate
23 case and applied to the change in regulatory asset balances caused
24 by the qualifying electric plant, plus applicable federal, state,
Req. No. 13216 Page 10

1 and local income or excise taxes. In determining the return
2 deferred, the public utility shall account for changes in all plant-
3 related accumulated deferred income taxes and changes in accumulated
4 depreciation, excluding retirements.
5 G. This section shall only apply to any public utility that has
6 elected to make the deferrals for which this section provides and
7 has filed a notice of such election with the Commission.
8 SECTION 3. NEW LAW A new section of law to be codified
9 in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 296 of Title 17, unless there is
10 created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:
11 A. The Commission shall have the authority to ensure the
12 development of new high-voltage transmission lines of three hundred
13 (300) kilovolts or greater approved for construction in a Southwest
14 Power Pool transmission plan provides reliable service at the lowest
15 reasonable cost to Oklahoma retail electric consumers.
16 B. For a retail electric supplier or rural electric cooperative
17 constructing an extension of its existing electric transmission
18 facility or to the facilities within or through any territory
19 already served by or connecting to facilities owned by it, the
20 retail electric supplier or rural electric cooperative shall be
21 permitted to construct, own, and maintain such facilities, provided
22 they meet the following conditions:
23 1. The retail electric supplier or rural electric cooperative
24 identifies any energy resource to which the electric transmission
Req. No. 13216 Page 11

1 faci lity is to be directly connected or, to the extent known,
2 resources to which the electric transmission facility could be
3 connected to integrate new or existing natural gas generation;
4 2. The retail electric supplier or rural electric cooperative
5 solicits competitive bids for construction of an extension of the
6 electric transmission facility. Transmission developers, as defined
7 in Enrolled House Bill No. 2756 of the 60th Regular Session of the
8 Oklahoma Legislature, shall not be precluded from submitting bids
9 through the solicitation described in this section; and
10 3. Such solicitation for competitive bids is overseen by an
11 independent evaluator chosen from a list approved by the Commission.
12 The Commission's independent evaluator shall consider factors
13 including, but not limited to, cost of construction, cost of
14 operation and maintenance, reliability, and decommissioning in its
15 evaluation.
16 C. Nothing in this section is intended to supersede the rights
17 of any person, firm, corporation, entity, or incumbent electric
18 transmission owner described in any other statute, alter an
19 incumbent electric transmission owner's use and control of its
20 existing right-of-way, or eliminate any requirement for a
21 transmission developer to seek a Certificate of Authority pursuant
22 to Enrolled House Bill No. 2756 of the 60th Regular Session of the
23 Oklahoma Legislature.
24
Req. No. 13216 Page 12

1 D. Nothing in this section is intended to preclude a
2 transmission developer, as defined in Enrolled House Bill No. 2756
3 of the 60th Regular Session of the Oklahoma Legislature, from
4 developing, owning, operating, controlling, managing, or maintaining
5 an existing electric transmission facility within this state.
6 E. An electric cooperative which is not a member of the
7 Southwest Power Pool may construct, own, and maintain local electric
8 transmission facilities without regard to the provisions of this
9 section.
10 SECTION 4. NEW LAW A new section of law to be codified
11 in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 801.10 of Title 17, unless there
12 is created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:
13 No Commission rate regulated retail electric supplier, as
14 defined in Section 158.22 of Title 17 of the Oklahoma Statutes,
15 shall offer rate-payer-funded incentives, rebates, or inducements to
16 its customers to promote the switching of fuel sources from natural
17 gas to electricity.
18 SECTION 5. It being immediately necessary for the preservation
19 of the public peace, health or safety, an emergency is hereby
20 declared to exist, by reason whereof this act shall take effect and
21 be in full force from and after its passage and approval.
