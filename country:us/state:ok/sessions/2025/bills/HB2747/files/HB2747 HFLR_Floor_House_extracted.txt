7 Section 286. A. 1. The portion of costs incurred by an
8 electric utility, which is subject to rate regulation by the
9 Corporation Commission, for transmission upgrades approved by a
10 regional transmission organization to which the utility is a member
11 and resulting from an order of a federal regulatory authority having
12 legal jurisdiction over interstate regulation of transmission rates,
13 shall be presumed recoverable by the utility. The presumption
14 established in this paragraph may be rebutted by evidence that the
15 costs so incurred by the utility for the transmission upgrades
16 exceed the scope of the project authorized by the regional
17 transmission organization or order issued by the federal regulatory
18 authority having jurisdiction over interstate regulation of
19 transmission rates. The Commission shall transmit rules to
20 implement the requirements of this subsection to the Legislature on
21 or before April 1, 2006. The rules may authorize an electric

2 transmission upgrades:
3 a. needed to develop wind generation in this state,
4 b. approved by the Southwest Power Pool, and
5 c. placed into service before December 31, 2013,
6 shall be presumed recoverable through a periodic adjustment in the
7 rates of the utility, provided that the presumption of the recovery
8 of such costs or the recovery of such costs through a periodic
9 adjustment in rates may be rebutted by evidence presented to the
10 Commission. The determination of whether the costs shall be
11 recovered and whether the costs shall be recovered through a
12 periodic adjustment of rates shall be made by the Commission
13 following proper notice and hearing in a cause to be filed by the
14 electric utility in which it files such information as the
15 Commission may require.
16 B. An electric utility subject to rate regulation by the
17 Corporation Commission may file an application seeking Commission
18 authorization of a plan by the utility to make capital expenditures
19 for equipment or facilities necessary to comply with the federal

BOLD FACE denotes Committee Amendments.
1 gene ration facilities. The new natural-gas-fired generation
2 capacity eligible for those provisions shall also include new
3 natural-gas-fired capacity additions at an existing electric
4 generation facility. If a public utility implements a rate
5 adjustment mechanism pursuant to this section and subsequently
6 terminates the initiative to construct or acquire a stake in a
7 natural gas generating facility, the Commission shall have the
8 authority, following notice and hearing, to order the public utility
9 to refund customers any amounts collected through such rate
10 adjustment mechanism. In ordering any such refund, the Commission
11 shall give consideration as to the circumstances resulting in the
12 termination of the construction or acquisition.
13 7. For any new natural gas fired generating facility
14 constructed pursuant to this section, an electric utility shall
15 secure a firm contract to transport natural gas to the generating
16 facility. Such a contract shall be secured pursuant to a
17 competitive solicitation process conducted in accordance with
18 applicable Commission rules. The cost incurred for such a contract
19 shall be presumed recoverable by the electric utility through its
20 applicable fuel adjustment clause. Costs assessed upon the electric
21 utility by the Commission for noncompliance with this section shall
22 not be recoverable from the electric utility's customers. In the
23 event that the electric utility does not receive a bid for firm
24 transportation as a result of its competitive solicitation, the

6 SECTION 2. NEW LAW A new section of law to be codified
7 in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 295 of Title 17, unless there is
8 created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:
9 A. Commencing on July 1, 2025, a public utility shall defer to
10 a regulatory asset ninety percent (90%) of all depreciation expense
11 and return associated with all qualifying electric plants recorded
12 to plant-in-service on the utility's books, provided the public
13 utility has submitted notice to the Commission of the public
14 utility's election to make such deferrals pursuant to this section.
15 A qualifying electric plant shall include all incremental electric
16 plants added to plant-in-service by a public utility since the
17 utility's last general rate case, except transmission facilities or
18 new electric generating units.
19 B. Such deferral shall begin on July 1, 2025, if the public
20 utility has notified the Commission of the public utility's election
21 to make such deferral by such date or shall begin on the date that
22 such election is made if such election is made after July 1, 2025.
23 C. The Commission shall conduct a prudence review of the
24 associated qualifying electric plant resulting in the regulatory
HB2747 HFLR Page 9
BOLD FACE denotes Committee Amendments.
1 asse t balances prior to moving such balances into the public
2 utility's rate base. The regulatory asset balances arising under
3 this section shall be adjusted to reflect any prudence disallowances
4 of the associated qualifying electric plant, following notice and
5 hearing, as ordered by the Commission.
6 D. In each general rate proceeding concluded after July 1,
7 2025, the balance of the regulatory asset as the end of the test
8 year shall be included in the public utility's rate base without any
9 offset, reduction, or adjustment based upon consideration of any
10 other factor with the regulatory asset balances arising from the
11 deferrals associated with the qualifying electric plant placed in
12 service after the end of the test year to be included in the rate
13 base in the next general rate proceeding, unless otherwise provided
14 in this section.
15 E. Parts of regulatory asset balances created under this
16 section that are not included in rate base shall accrue carrying
17 costs as the public utility's weighted average cost of capital, plus
18 applicable federal, state, and local income or excise taxes.
19 Regulatory asset balances arising under this section that are
20 included in the rate base shall be recovered through a twenty-year
21 amortization beginning on the date new rates reflecting such
22 amortization take effect.
23 F. Depreciation expense deferred under this section shall
24 account for any qualifying electric plant placed into service, less

1 any applicable retirements. Returns deferred under this section
2 shall be determined using the weighted average cost of capital
3 approved by the Commission in the public utility's last general rate
4 case and applied to the change in regulatory asset balances caused
5 by the qualifying electric plant, plus applicable federal, state,
6 and local income or excise taxes. In determining the return
7 deferred, the public utility shall account for changes in all plant-
8 related accumulated deferred income taxes and changes in accumulated
9 depreciation, excluding retirements.
10 G. This section shall only apply to any public utility that has
11 elected to make the deferrals for which this section provides and
12 has filed a notice of such election with the Commission.

9 assessments as authorized by this subsection,
10 b. establish how the cost of facilities approved pursuant
11 to this subsection shall be timely reviewed, approved,
12 and recovered or disapproved, and
13 c. establish the information which an electric utility
14 must provide when filing an application pursuant to
15 this subsection.
16 5. 6. The Commission shall also consider rules which may permit
17 an electric utility to begin to recover return on or and return of
18 Construction-Work-In-Progress expenses prior to commercial operation
19 of a newly constructed electric generation facility subject to the
20 provisions of this subsection, provided the newly constructed
21 electric generation facility utilizes natural gas as its primary
22 fuel source. The Commission shall permit a separate rate adjustment
23 mechanism, adjusted periodically, to recover the costs described in
24 this section for new capacity in natural-gas-fired electrical

1 gene ration facilities. The new natural-gas-fired generation
2 capacity eligible for those provisions shall also include new
3 natural-gas-fired capacity additions at an existing electric
4 generation facility. If a public utility implements a rate
5 adjustment mechanism pursuant to this section and subsequently
6 terminates the initiative to construct or acquire a stake in a
7 natural gas generating facility, the Commission shall have the
8 authority, following notice and hearing, to order the public utility
9 to refund customers any amounts collected through such rate
10 adjustment mechanism. In ordering any such refund, the Commission
11 shall give consideration as to the circumstances resulting in the
12 termination of the construction or acquisition.
13 7. For any new natural gas fired generating facility
14 constructed pursuant to this section, an electric utility shall
15 secure a firm contract to transport natural gas to the generating
16 facility. Such a contract shall be secured pursuant to a
17 competitive solicitation process conducted in accordance with
18 applicable Commission rules. The cost incurred for such a contract
19 shall be presumed recoverable by the electric utility through its
20 applicable fuel adjustment clause. Costs assessed upon the electric
21 utility by the Commission for noncompliance with this section shall
22 not be recoverable from the electric utility's customers. In the
23 event that the electric utility does not receive a bid for firm
24 transportation as a result of its competitive solicitation, the
HB2747 HFLR Page 8
BOLD FACE denotes Committee Amendments.

1 elec tric utility shall be considered compliant with the requirement
2 of this section; provided that the Commission determines that such
3 competitive solicitation is for a firm contract for transportation
4 of natural gas which could be reasonably provided by an available
5 pipeline.
6 SECTION 2. NEW LAW A new section of law to be codified
7 in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 295 of Title 17, unless there is
8 created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:
9 A. Commencing on July 1, 2025, a public utility shall defer to
10 a regulatory asset ninety percent (90%) of all depreciation expense
11 and return associated with all qualifying electric plants recorded
12 to plant-in-service on the utility's books, provided the public
13 utility has submitted notice to the Commission of the public
14 utility's election to make such deferrals pursuant to this section.
15 A qualifying electric plant shall include all incremental electric
16 plants added to plant-in-service by a public utility since the
17 utility's last general rate case, except transmission facilities or
18 new electric generating units.
19 B. Such deferral shall begin on July 1, 2025, if the public
20 utility has notified the Commission of the public utility's election
21 to make such deferral by such date or shall begin on the date that
22 such election is made if such election is made after July 1, 2025.
23 C. The Commission shall conduct a prudence review of the
24 associated qualifying electric plant resulting in the regulatory
HB2747 HFLR Page 9
BOLD FACE denotes Committee Amendments.

1 asse t balances prior to moving such balances into the public
2 utility's rate base. The regulatory asset balances arising under
3 this section shall be adjusted to reflect any prudence disallowances
4 of the associated qualifying electric plant, following notice and
5 hearing, as ordered by the Commission.
6 D. In each general rate proceeding concluded after July 1,
7 2025, the balance of the regulatory asset as the end of the test
8 year shall be included in the public utility's rate base without any
9 offset, reduction, or adjustment based upon consideration of any
10 other factor with the regulatory asset balances arising from the
11 deferrals associated with the qualifying electric plant placed in
12 service after the end of the test year to be included in the rate
13 base in the next general rate proceeding, unless otherwise provided
14 in this section.
15 E. Parts of regulatory asset balances created under this
16 section that are not included in rate base shall accrue carrying
17 costs as the public utility's weighted average cost of capital, plus
18 applicable federal, state, and local income or excise taxes.
19 Regulatory asset balances arising under this section that are
20 included in the rate base shall be recovered through a twenty-year
21 amortization beginning on the date new rates reflecting such
22 amortization take effect.
23 F. Depreciation expense deferred under this section shall
24 account for any qualifying electric plant placed into service, less

1 any applicable retirements. Returns deferred under this section
2 shall be determined using the weighted average cost of capital
3 approved by the Commission in the public utility's last general rate
4 case and applied to the change in regulatory asset balances caused
5 by the qualifying electric plant, plus applicable federal, state,
6 and local income or excise taxes. In determining the return
7 deferred, the public utility shall account for changes in all plant-
8 related accumulated deferred income taxes and changes in accumulated
9 depreciation, excluding retirements.
10 G. This section shall only apply to any public utility that has
11 elected to make the deferrals for which this section provides and
12 has filed a notice of such election with the Commission.
13 SECTION 3. NEW LAW A new section of law to be codified
14 in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 296 of Title 17, unless there is
15 created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:
16 A. The Commission shall have the authority to ensure the
17 development of new high-voltage transmission lines of three hundred
18 (300) kilovolts or greater approved for construction in a Southwest
19 Power Pool transmission plan provides reliable service at the lowest
20 reasonable cost to Oklahoma retail electric consumers.
21 B. For a retail electric supplier or rural electric cooperative
22 constructing an extension of its existing electric transmission
23 facility or to the facilities within or through any territory
24 already served by or connecting to facilities owned by it, the
HB2747 HFLR Page 11

1 reta il electric supplier or rural electric cooperative shall be
2 permitted to construct, own, and maintain such facilities, provided
3 they meet the following conditions:
4 1. The retail electric supplier or rural electric cooperative
5 identifies any energy resource to which the electric transmission
6 facility is to be directly connected or, to the extent known,
7 resources to which the electric transmission facility could be
8 connected to integrate new or existing natural gas generation;
9 2. The retail electric supplier or rural electric cooperative
10 solicits competitive bids for construction of an extension of the
11 electric transmission facility. Transmission developers, as defined
12 in Enrolled House Bill No. 2756 of the 60th Regular Session of the
13 Oklahoma Legislature, shall not be precluded from submitting bids
14 through the solicitation described in this section; and
15 3. Such solicitation for competitive bids is overseen by an
16 independent evaluator chosen from a list approved by the Commission.
17 The Commission's independent evaluator shall consider factors
18 including, but not limited to, cost of construction, cost of
19 operation and maintenance, reliability, and decommissioning in its
20 evaluation.
21 C. Nothing in this section is intended to supersede the rights
22 of any person, firm, corporation, entity, or incumbent electric
23 transmission owner described in any other statute, alter an
24 incumbent electric transmission owner's use and control of its
HB2747 HFLR Page 12

6 transmission developer, as defined in Enrolled House Bill No. 2756
7 of the 60th Regular Session of the Oklahoma Legislature, from
8 developing, owning, operating, controlling, managing, or maintaining
9 an existing electric transmission facility within this state.
10 E. An electric cooperative which is not a member of the
11 Southwest Power Pool may construct, own, and maintain local electric
12 transmission facilities without regard to the provisions of this
13 section.
14 SECTION 4. NEW LAW A new section of law to be codified
15 in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 801.10 of Title 17, unless there
16 is created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:
17 No Commission rate regulated retail electric supplier, as
18 defined in Section 158.22 of Title 17 of the Oklahoma Statutes,
19 shall offer rate-payer-funded incentives, rebates, or inducements to
