4 amended to read as follows:
5 Section 286. A. 1. The portion of costs incurred by an
6 electric utility, which is subject to rate regulation by the
7 Corporation Commission, for transmission upgrades approved by a
8 regional transmission organization to which the utility is a member
9 and resulting from an order of a federal regulatory authority having
10 legal jurisdiction over interstate regulation of transmission rates,
11 shall be presumed recoverable by the utility. The presumption
12 established in this paragraph may be rebutted by evidence that the
13 costs so incurred by the utility for the transmission upgrades
14 exceed the scope of the project authorized by the regional
15 transmission organization or order issued by the federal regulatory
16 authority having jurisdiction over interstate regulation of
17 transmission rates. The Commission shall transmit rules to
18 implement the requirements of this subsection to the Legislature on
19 or before April 1, 2006. The rules may authorize an electric
20 utility to periodically adjust its rates to recover all or a portion
21 of the costs so incurred by the utility for the transmission
22 upgrades.
23 2. Reasonable costs incurred by an electric utility for
24 transmission upgrades:
Req. No. 10897 Page 2
1 a. needed to develop wind generation in this state,
2 b. approved by the Southwest Power Pool, and
3 c. placed into service before December 31, 2013,
4 shall be presumed recoverable through a periodic adjustment in the
5 rates of the utility, provided that the presumption of the recovery
6 of such costs or the recovery of such costs through a periodic
7 adjustment in rates may be rebutted by evidence presented to the
8 Commission. The determination of whether the costs shall be
9 recovered and whether the costs shall be recovered through a
10 periodic adjustment of rates shall be made by the Commission
11 following proper notice and hearing in a cause to be filed by the
12 electric utility in which it files such information as the
13 Commission may require.
14 B. An electric utility subject to rate regulation by the
15 Corporation Commission may file an application seeking Commission
16 authorization of a plan by the utility to make capital expenditures
17 for equipment or facilities necessary to comply with the federal

4 generation facilities. If approved by the Commission, after notice
5 and hearing, the equipment or facilities specified in the approved
6 utility plan are conclusively presumed used and useful. The utility
7 may elect to periodically adjust its rates to recover the costs of
8 the expenditures. The utility shall file a request for a review of
9 its rates pursuant to Section 152 of this title no more than twenty-
10 four (24) months after the utility begins recovering the costs
11 through a periodic rate adjustment mechanism and no more than
12 twenty-four (24) months after the utility begins recovering the
13 costs through any subsequent periodic rate adjustment mechanism.
14 Provided further, that a periodic rate adjustment or adjustments are
15 not intended to prevent a utility from seeking cost recovery of
16 capital expenditures as otherwise may be authorized by the
17 Commission. However, the reasonableness of the costs to be
18 recovered by the utility shall be subject to Commission review and
19 approval. The Commission shall promulgate rules to implement the
20 provisions of this subsection, such rules to be transmitted to the
21 Legislature on or before April 1, 2007.
