4 SECTION 1. AMENDATORY 17 O.S. 2021, Section 286, is
5 amended to read as follows:
6 Section 286. A. 1. The portion of costs incurred by an
7 electric utility, which is subject to rate regulation by the
8 Corporation Commission, for transmission upgrades approved by a
9 regional transmission organization to which the utility is a member
10 and resulting from an order of a federal regulatory authority having
11 legal jurisdiction over interstate regulation of transmission rates,
12 shall be presumed recoverable by the utility. The presumption
13 established in this paragraph may be rebutted by evidence that the
14 costs so incurred by the utility for the transmission upgrades
15 exceed the scope of the project authorized by the regional
16 transmission organization or order issued by the federal regulatory
17 authority having jurisdiction over interstate regulation of
18 transmission rates. The Commission shall transmit rules to
19 implement the requirements of this subsection to the Legislature on
20 or before April 1, 2006. The rules may authorize an electric
21 utility to periodically adjust its rates to recover all or a portion
22 of the costs so incurred by the utility for the transmission
23 upgrades.
24
Req. No. 12690 Page 2

1 2. Reasonable costs incurred by an electric utility for
2 transmission upgrades:
3 a. needed to develop wind generation in this state,
4 b. approved by the Southwest Power Pool, and
5 c. placed into service before December 31, 2013,
6 shall be presumed recoverable through a periodic adjustment in the
7 rates of the utility, provided that the presumption of the recovery
8 of such costs or the recovery of such costs through a periodic
9 adjustment in rates may be rebutted by evidence presented to the
10 Commission. The determination of whether the costs shall be
11 recovered and whether the costs shall be recovered through a
12 periodic adjustment of rates shall be made by the Commission
13 following proper notice and hearing in a cause to be filed by the
14 electric utility in which it files such information as the
15 Commission may require.
16 B. An electric utility subject to rate regulation by the
17 Corporation Commission may file an application seeking Commission
18 authorization of a plan by the utility to make capital expenditures
19 for equipment or facilities necessary to comply with the federal
20 Clean Air Act (CAA), the Clean Water Act (CWA), the Comprehensive
21 Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA),
22 the Emergency Planning & Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA), the
23 Endangered Species Act (ESA), the National Environmental Policy Act
24 (NEPA), the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA), the Oil
Req. No. 12690 Page 3

1 Poll ution Act (OPA), the Pollution Prevention Act (PPA), the
2 Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), the Safe Drinking
3 Water Act (SDWA), the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), all as
4 amended, and, as the Commission may deem appropriate, federal,
5 state, local or tribal environmental requirements which apply to
6 generation facilities. If approved by the Commission, after notice
7 and hearing, the equipment or facilities specified in the approved
8 utility plan are conclusively presumed used and useful. The utility
9 may elect to periodically adjust its rates to recover the costs of
10 the expenditures. The utility shall file a request for a review of
11 its rates pursuant to Section 152 of this title no more than twenty-
12 four (24) months after the utility begins recovering the costs
13 through a periodic rate adjustment mechanism and no more than
14 twenty-four (24) months after the utility begins recovering the
15 costs through any subsequent periodic rate adjustment mechanism.
16 Provided further, that a periodic rate adjustment or adjustments are
17 not intended to prevent a utility from seeking cost recovery of
18 capital expenditures as otherwise may be authorized by the
19 Commission. However, the reasonableness of the costs to be
20 recovered by the utility shall be subject to Commission review and
21 approval. The Commission shall promulgate rules to implement the
22 provisions of this subsection, such rules to that shall be
23 transmitted to the Legislature on or before April 1, 2007.
24
Req. No. 12690 Page 4

1 C. 1. An electric utility subject to rate regulation by the
2 Corporation Commission may elect to file an application seeking
3 approval by the Commission to construct a new electric generating
4 facility, to purchase an existing electric generation facility or
5 enter into a long-term contract for purchased power and capacity
6 and/or energy, subject to the provisions of this subsection. If,
7 and to the extent that, the Commission determines there is a need
8 for construction or purchase of the electric generating facility or
9 long-term purchase power contract, the generating facility or
10 contract shall be considered used and useful and its costs shall be
11 subject to cost recovery rules promulgated by the Commission. The
12 Commission shall enter an order on an application filed pursuant to
13 this subsection within two hundred forty (240) days of the filing of
14 the application, unless the generation facility utilizes natural gas
15 as its primary fuel source, following notice and hearing and after
16 consideration of reasonable alternatives. If the generation
17 facility uses natural gas as its primary fuel source, the Commission
18 shall enter an order on an application filed pursuant to this
19 subsection within one hundred eighty (180) days of the filing of the
20 application, following notice and hearing and after consideration of
21 the reasonable alternative.
22 2. Bids received by the utility through a competitive bidding
23 process within twelve (12) months following the final bid due date
24
Req. No. 12690 Page 5

2 evidence to satisfy the consideration of reasonable alternatives.
3 2. 3. Following receipt of an application filed pursuant to
4 this subsection, the Corporation Commission staff may file a request
5 to assess the specific costs, to be paid by the electric utility and
6 which shall be deemed to be recoverable, for the costs associated
7 with conducting the analysis or investigation of the application
8 including, but not limited to, the cost of acquiring expert
9 witnesses, consultants, and analytical services. The request shall
10 be filed at and heard by the Corporation Commissioners in the docket
11 opened by the electric utility pursuant to this subsection. After
12 notice and hearing, the Commission shall decide the request.
13 3. 4. Additionally, following receipt of an application filed
14 pursuant to this subsection, the Office of the Attorney General may
15 file a request with the Corporation Commission for the assessment of
16 specific costs, to be paid by the electric utility and which shall
17 be deemed to be recoverable, associated with the performance of the
18 Attorney General's duties as provided by law. Those costs may
19 include, but are not limited to, the cost of acquiring expert
20 witnesses, consultants and analytical services. The request shall
21 be filed at and heard by the Corporation Commissioners in the docket
22 opened by the electric utility pursuant to this subsection. After
23 notice and hearing, the Commission shall decide the request.
24
Req. No. 12690 Page 6

1 4. 5. The Commission shall promulgate rules to implement the
2 provisions of this subsection. The rules shall be transmitted to
3 the Legislature on or before April 1, 2006. In promulgating rules
4 to implement the provisions of this subsection, the Commission shall
5 consider, among other things, rules which would:
6 a. permit contemporaneous utility recovery from its
7 customers, the amount necessary to cover the
8 Corporation Commission staff and Attorney General
9 assessments as authorized by this subsection,
10 b. establish how the cost of facilities approved pursuant
11 to this subsection shall be timely reviewed, approved,
12 and recovered or disapproved, and
13 c. establish the information which an electric utility
14 must provide when filing an application pursuant to
15 this subsection.
16 5. 6. The Commission shall also consider rules which may permit
17 an electric utility to begin to recover return on or and return of
18 Construction-Work-In-Progress expenses prior to commercial operation
19 of a newly constructed electric generation facility subject to the
20 provisions of this subsection, provided the newly constructed
21 electric generation facility utilizes natural gas as its primary
22 fuel source. The Commission shall permit a separate rate adjustment
23 mechanism, adjusted periodically, to recover the costs described in
24 this section for new capacity in natural gas fired electrical
Req. No. 12690 Page 7

1 gene ration facilities. The new natural gas fired generation
2 capacity eligible for those provisions shall also include new
3 natural gas fired capacity additions at an existing electric
4 generation facility. If a public utility implements a rate
5 adjustment mechanism pursuant to this section and subsequently
6 terminates the initiative to construct or acquire a stake in a
7 natural gas generating facility, the Commission shall have the
8 authority, following notice and hearing, to order the public utility
9 to refund customers any amounts collected through such rate
10 adjustment mechanism. In ordering any such refund, the Commission
11 shall give consideration as to the circumstances resulting in the
12 termination of the construction or acquisition.
13 SECTION 2. NEW LAW A new section of law to be codified
14 in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 295 of Title 17, unless there is
15 created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:
16 A. Commencing on July 1, 2025, a public utility shall defer to
17 a regulatory asset ninety percent (90%) of all depreciation expense
18 and return associated with all qualifying electric plants recorded
19 to plant-in-service on the utility's books, provided the public
20 utility has submitted notice to the Commission of the public
21 utility's election to make such deferrals pursuant to this section.
22 A qualifying electric plant shall include all incremental electric
23 plants added to plant-in-service by a public utility since the
24
Req. No. 12690 Page 8

1 util ity's last general rate case, except transmission facilities or
2 new electric generating units.
3 B. Such deferral shall begin on July 1, 2025, if the public
4 utility has notified the Commission of the public utility's election
5 to make such deferral by such date or shall begin on the date that
6 such election is made if such election is made after July 1, 2025.
7 C. The Commission shall conduct a prudence review of the
8 associated qualifying electric plant resulting in the regulatory
9 asset balances prior to moving such balances into the public
10 utility's rate base. The regulatory asset balances arising under
11 this section shall be adjusted to reflect any prudence disallowances
12 of the associated qualifying electric plant, following notice and
13 hearing, as ordered by the Commission.
14 D. In each general rate proceeding concluded after July 1,
15 2025, the balance of the regulatory asset as the end of the test
16 year shall be included in the public utility's rate base without any
17 offset, reduction, or adjustment based upon consideration of any
18 other factor with the regulatory asset balances arising from the
19 deferrals associated with the qualifying electric plant placed in
20 service after the end of the test year to be included in the rate
21 base in the next general rate proceeding, unless otherwise provided
22 in this section.
23 E. Parts of regulatory asset balances created under this
24 section that are not included in rate base shall accrue carrying

4 included in the rate base shall be recovered through a twenty-year
5 amortization beginning on the date new rates reflecting such
6 amortization take effect.
7 F. Depreciation expense deferred under this section shall
8 account for any qualifying electric plant placed into service less
9 any applicable retirements. Returns deferred under this section
10 shall be determined using the weighted average cost of capital
11 approved by the Commission in the public utility's last general rate
12 case and applied to the change in regulatory asset balances caused
13 by the qualifying electric plant, plus applicable federal, state,
14 and local income or excise taxes. In determining the return
15 deferred, the public utility shall account for changes in all plant-
16 related accumulated deferred income taxes and changes in accumulated
17 depreciation, excluding retirements.
18 G. This section shall only apply to any public utility that has
19 elected to make the deferrals for which this section provides and
20 has filed a notice of such election with the Commission.
