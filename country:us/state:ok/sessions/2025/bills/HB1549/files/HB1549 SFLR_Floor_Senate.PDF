(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)

1 fami ly mortgage and student loan bond proceeds or mortgage credit

1 H. An original confirmation shall cease to be effective to
2 assure allocation of any portion of the state ceiling unless the
3 bonds, notes, other evidences of indebtedness, or the appropriate
4 election filed with the Internal Revenue Service exchanging mortgage
5 bond authority for mortgage credit certificate authority have been
6 issued or filed within one hundred twenty (120) days after the date
7 of such confirmation. No extensions shall be granted. Such
8 issuance shall be evidenced by the mailing, transmittal or delivery
9 of a final certification to the Deputy Treasurer for Debt Management
10 within the time specified by this subsection. Receipt by an issuer
11 of a confirmation as contemplated by this section shall entitle the
12 issuer to rely conclusively upon the accuracy of the Deputy
13 Treasurer for Debt Management's mathematical calculation and the
14 allocation for purposes of closing.
15 I. The confirmation given in advance of bond issuance or
16 mortgage credit certificate election will assure allocation for only
17 the amount of such bonds or mortgage credit certificate authority as
18 is therein set forth, unless a supplementary application for state
19 ceiling allocation for an increase in amount is filed with and a
20 supplementary confirmation is issued by the Deputy Treasurer for
21 Debt Management for such requested allocation prior to such bond
22 issuance or such election, pursuant to the Oklahoma Private Activity
23 Bond Allocation Act. The supplementary confirmation shall be
24 effective for the same period as the prior confirmation which it

(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)

1 supp lements. Provided, however, no supplementary confirmation shall
2 be effective to preempt any intervening confirmation as to
3 allocation of a portion of the state ceiling.
4 J. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, all
5 confirmation dates for an issue of private activity bonds or
6 mortgage credit certificate programs expire on December 20 1 of each
7 calendar year. Final certification of issuance shall be delivered
8 to the Deputy Treasurer for Debt Management by 9:00 a.m. on December
9 20 1 of each calendar year.
10 K. On or after 9:00 a.m. on December 20 1 of each calendar
11 year, issuing authorities may apply to the Deputy Treasurer for Debt
12 Management to carry forward a portion of the state ceiling for such
13 calendar year allocated to any qualified carryforward project, as
14 said term is used in Section 103(n)(10) and 146(f) of the Internal
15 Revenue Code and which shall be evidenced by the issuance of
16 confirmations for all carryforward projects within the limitations
17 of the state ceiling. Provided, issuers or projects with more than
18 Twenty Million Dollars ($20,000,000.00) of carryforward outstanding
19 as of the date of the application for carryforward shall only be
20 eligible for carryforward allocations to the extent other issuers
21 with less than Twenty Million Dollars ($20,000,000.00) of
22 outstanding carryforward authority do not fully commit the state
23 ceiling. Allocations on carryforward projects shall be processed on
24 the basis of the chronological receipt of applications, subject to
SENATE FLOOR VERSION - HB1549 SFLR Page 26
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)

1 para graph 3 of subsection C of this section. No portion of the
2 state ceiling carried forward for any given year may be carried

4 the calendar year in which the carryforward arose, except as
5 otherwise permitted under federal law.
6 L. The Deputy Treasurer for Debt Management shall maintain
7 continuous and cumulative records which shall include a list and
8 cumulative dollar total of the private activity bonds for which:
9 1. Private activity bonds have been issued or state ceiling
10 exchanged for mortgage credit certificate authority and final
11 certifications have been received by the Deputy Treasurer for Debt
12 Management;
13 2. Confirmations of carryforward have been issued; and
14 3. Confirmations in effect and outstanding for which no private
15 activity bonds or mortgage credit certificate elections have been
16 issued or filed.
17 The Deputy Treasurer for Debt Management shall keep continuous and
18 cumulative records and totals for each of the categories specified
19 in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of this subsection as well as the aggregate
20 total of all categories. The Deputy Treasurer for Debt Management
21 shall not give further confirmations at such time as the aggregate
22 amount of bonds, other indebtedness, carryforward or mortgage credit
23 certificate elections specified by paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of this
24 subsection equals the state ceiling authorized for the applicable
SENATE FLOOR VERSION - HB1549 SFLR Page 27
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)

1 year . The Deputy Treasurer for Debt Management shall not award a
2 confirmation if such award would cause indebtedness, carryforward or
3 elections as specified by paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of this subsection
4 to exceed the state ceiling. Confirmation records shall be compiled
5 and furnished to any local issuer and state issuer upon written
6 request and payment of a fee of Fifteen Dollars ($15.00) which shall
7 be apportioned to the General Revenue Fund. Upon issuance of a
8 confirmation, the amounts of the proposed bond issue, mortgage
9 credit certificate election and carryforward confirmation shall be
10 included in the continuing, mathematical calculation, until the same
11 shall have been terminated in accordance with this section.
12 M. The person signing any confirmation for any allocations
13 granted pursuant to the Oklahoma Private Activity Bond Allocation
14 Act shall certify under penalty of perjury that such allocation was
15 not made in consideration of any bribe, gift, gratuity or direct or
16 indirect contribution to any political campaign.
17 N. A state or local issuer, who intentionally overissues
18 mortgage credit certificates or bonds, shall be prohibited from
19 making application for an allocation of the state ceiling for any
20 purpose for a period of three (3) years following discovery of such
21 over issuance.
22 SECTION 5. This act shall become effective November 1, 2025.
