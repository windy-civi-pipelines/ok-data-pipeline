the Deputy Treasurer for Debt Management shall send, within five (5)
business days of the receipt thereof, a confirmation of the
allocation of the state ceiling for the subject project or purpose
to the person designated in the application for state ceiling
allocation. Provided, the Deputy Treasurer for Debt Management may
reject an application or deny a confirmation pursuant to the
provisions of this subsection.

Section 80:
2. The Deputy Treasurer for Debt Management may reject any
application which is incomplete or filed with insufficient
information. The Deputy Treasurer for Debt Management may reject
any application where, in the Deputy Treasurer for Debt Management
judgment, a reasonable likelihood has not been shown that single-
family mortgage and student loan bond proceeds or mortgage credit
ENR. H. B. NO. 1549 Page 15
certificates will be used for their intended public purposes. In
the event an application or confirmation is denied, within five (5)
business days following such denial, the Deputy Treasurer for Debt
Management shall send the applicant written notice of the denial of
an application or confirmation together with the reason or reasons
therefor. In the case of disapprovals of applications or
confirmations, an applicant may appeal the disapproval by submitting
a new application to the Council of Bond Oversight, along with an
explanation addressing the reasons for disapproval cited in the
Deputy Treasurer for Debt Management letter. The Council of Bond
Oversight, through affirmative action of the Council, may accept an
application rejected by the Deputy Treasurer for Debt Management, or
order the Deputy Treasurer for Debt Management to issue a
confirmation of allocation, subject to provisions of the Oklahoma
Private Activity Bond Allocation Act. Applicants may submit only
one new application based on an appeal of any specific application
previously submitted.

Section 81:
3. Only complete applications, as determined by the Deputy
Treasurer for Debt Management, shall be used to establish the
chronological order of applications. In the case of a new
application submitted based on an appeal, chronological order shall
be established at the time the new application is submitted.
H. An original confirmation shall cease to be effective to
assure allocation of any portion of the state ceiling unless the
bonds, notes, other evidences of indebtedness, or the appropriate
election filed with the Internal Revenue Service exchanging mortgage
bond authority for mortgage credit certificate authority have been
issued or filed within one hundred twenty (120) days after the date
of such confirmation. No extensions shall be granted. Such
issuance shall be evidenced by the mailing, transmittal or delivery
of a final certification to the Deputy Treasurer for Debt Management
within the time specified by this subsection. Receipt by an issuer
of a confirmation as contemplated by this section shall entitle the
issuer to rely conclusively upon the accuracy of the Deputy
Treasurer for Debt Management's mathematical calculation and the
allocation for purposes of closing.
I. The confirmation given in advance of bond issuance or
mortgage credit certificate election will assure allocation for only
the amount of such bonds or mortgage credit certificate authority as
is therein set forth, unless a supplementary application for state
ceiling allocation for an increase in amount is filed with and a
supplementary confirmation is issued by the Deputy Treasurer for
ENR. H. B. NO. 1549 Page 16
Debt Management for such requested allocation prior to such bond
issuance or such election, pursuant to the Oklahoma Private Activity
Bond Allocation Act. The supplementary confirmation shall be
effective for the same period as the prior confirmation which it
supplements. Provided, however, no supplementary confirmation shall
be effective to preempt any intervening confirmation as to
allocation of a portion of the state ceiling.
J. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, all
confirmation dates for an issue of private activity bonds or
mortgage credit certificate programs expire on December 20 1 of each
calendar year. Final certification of issuance shall be delivered
to the Deputy Treasurer for Debt Management by 9:00 a.m. on December
20 1 of each calendar year.
K. On or after 9:00 a.m. on December 20 1 of each calendar
year, issuing authorities may apply to the Deputy Treasurer for Debt
Management to carry forward a portion of the state ceiling for such
calendar year allocated to any qualified carryforward project, as
said term is used in Section 103(n)(10) and 146(f) of the Internal
Revenue Code and which shall be evidenced by the issuance of
confirmations for all carryforward projects within the limitations
of the state ceiling. Provided, issuers or projects with more than
Twenty Million Dollars ($20,000,000.00) of carryforward outstanding
as of the date of the application for carryforward shall only be
eligible for carryforward allocations to the extent other issuers
with less than Twenty Million Dollars ($20,000,000.00) of
outstanding carryforward authority do not fully commit the state
ceiling. Allocations on carryforward projects shall be processed on
the basis of the chronological receipt of applications, subject to
paragraph 3 of subsection C of this section. No portion of the
state ceiling carried forward for any given year may be carried
forward for a period in excess of three (3) calendar years following
the calendar year in which the carryforward arose, except as
otherwise permitted under federal law.
L. The Deputy Treasurer for Debt Management shall maintain
continuous and cumulative records which shall include a list and
cumulative dollar total of the private activity bonds for which:

Section 82:
1. Private activity bonds have been issued or state ceiling
exchanged for mortgage credit certificate authority and final
certifications have been received by the Deputy Treasurer for Debt
Management;
ENR. H. B. NO. 1549 Page 17

Section 83:
2. Confirmations of carryforward have been issued; and

Section 84:
3. Confirmations in effect and outstanding for which no private
activity bonds or mortgage credit certificate elections have been
issued or filed.
The Deputy Treasurer for Debt Management shall keep continuous and
cumulative records and totals for each of the categories specified
in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of this subsection as well as the aggregate
total of all categories. The Deputy Treasurer for Debt Management
shall not give further confirmations at such time as the aggregate
amount of bonds, other indebtedness, carryforward or mortgage credit
certificate elections specified by paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of this
subsection equals the state ceiling authorized for the applicable
year. The Deputy Treasurer for Debt Management shall not award a
confirmation if such award would cause indebtedness, carryforward or
elections as specified by paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of this subsection
to exceed the state ceiling. Confirmation records shall be compiled
and furnished to any local issuer and state issuer upon written
request and payment of a fee of Fifteen Dollars ($15.00) which shall
be apportioned to the General Revenue Fund. Upon issuance of a
confirmation, the amounts of the proposed bond issue, mortgage
credit certificate election and carryforward confirmation shall be
included in the continuing, mathematical calculation, until the same
shall have been terminated in accordance with this section.
M. The person signing any confirmation for any allocations
granted pursuant to the Oklahoma Private Activity Bond Allocation
Act shall certify under penalty of perjury that such allocation was
not made in consideration of any bribe, gift, gratuity or direct or
indirect contribution to any political campaign.
N. A state or local issuer, who intentionally overissues
mortgage credit certificates or bonds, shall be prohibited from
making application for an allocation of the state ceiling for any
purpose for a period of three (3) years following discovery of such
over issuance.

Section 85:
SECTION 5. This act shall become effective November 1, 2025.

which the allocation is requested requires "official action" under

evidencing its approval of the issuance of the issuer's obligations,
if the issuer is a municipal or county public trust, or a
certificate signed by the Governor of the state evidencing his

1. The name and mailing address of the issuer, the beneficiary
and jurisdiction thereof, the name of the presiding officer of the
issuer and the respective pool from which an allocation is
requested;
2. The name and mailing address or other definitive description
of the location of the project or bonds and the purpose for which an
allocation of the state ceiling is requested, the name and mailing
address of both the initial owner or operator of the project, where
applicable, and an appropriate person from whom information

address of the person to whom the confirmation should be sent;
3. The amount of the state ceiling which the Issuer issuer is
requesting;
4. A statement of bond counsel for the issuer that the proposed
issue requires, pursuant to Section 103, Section 146 or such other
applicable sections of the Internal Revenue Code, an allocation of a
portion of the state ceiling; and
5. Where applicable, the intention to exchange single-family
mortgage bond authority for mortgage credit certificates.
F. 1. Applications for single-family mortgage bonds or
mortgage credit certificate programs shall also include the
submission of information demonstrating a reasonable expectation to
use an allocation of the state ceiling for its intended purpose.
This information shall include historical usage of mortgage revenue
bond proceeds or mortgage credit certificates in the geographic area
subject to an application over the previous twenty-four-month period
ENR. H. B. NO. 1549 Page 14

and the impact of known or possible competing programs that would
act to reduce demand. This information may also include demand
surveys. Provided, in cases where historical usage cannot be
documented, demand surveys shall be included with an application.
2. Applications for qualified student loan bonds shall also
include the submission of information showing a reasonable
expectation to use the state ceiling for its intended purpose. This
information shall include historical lending activity over the
previous twenty-four-month period as well as a demonstration of need
based upon such factors as increased enrollment costs, enrollment
increases, or new federal regulations that act to increase demand by
making changes to eligibility requirements to certain federally
guaranteed or subsidized student loan programs. This information

historical usage cannot be documented, demand surveys shall be
included with an application.
3. Applications shall also include evidence of a structure to

G. 1. Upon receipt of the completed application for state
ceiling allocation, copies of the official action and final
resolutions or certificates as required by subsection D of this
section and the information required by subsections E and F of this
section and assuming availability of the sum requested and
compliance with the Oklahoma Private Activity Bond Allocation Act,
the Deputy Treasurer for Debt Management shall send, within five (5)
business days of the receipt thereof, a confirmation of the
allocation of the state ceiling for the subject project or purpose
to the person designated in the application for state ceiling
allocation. Provided, the Deputy Treasurer for Debt Management may
reject an application or deny a confirmation pursuant to the
provisions of this subsection.
2. The Deputy Treasurer for Debt Management may reject any
application which is incomplete or filed with insufficient
information. The Deputy Treasurer for Debt Management may reject
any application where, in the Deputy Treasurer for Debt Management
judgment, a reasonable likelihood has not been shown that single-
family mortgage and student loan bond proceeds or mortgage credit
ENR. H. B. NO. 1549 Page 15

certificates will be used for their intended public purposes. In
the event an application or confirmation is denied, within five (5)
business days following such denial, the Deputy Treasurer for Debt
Management shall send the applicant written notice of the denial of
an application or confirmation together with the reason or reasons
therefor. In the case of disapprovals of applications or
confirmations, an applicant may appeal the disapproval by submitting
a new application to the Council of Bond Oversight, along with an
explanation addressing the reasons for disapproval cited in the
Deputy Treasurer for Debt Management letter. The Council of Bond
Oversight, through affirmative action of the Council, may accept an
application rejected by the Deputy Treasurer for Debt Management, or
order the Deputy Treasurer for Debt Management to issue a
confirmation of allocation, subject to provisions of the Oklahoma
Private Activity Bond Allocation Act. Applicants may submit only
one new application based on an appeal of any specific application
previously submitted.
3. Only complete applications, as determined by the Deputy
Treasurer for Debt Management, shall be used to establish the
chronological order of applications. In the case of a new
application submitted based on an appeal, chronological order shall
be established at the time the new application is submitted.
H. An original confirmation shall cease to be effective to
assure allocation of any portion of the state ceiling unless the
bonds, notes, other evidences of indebtedness, or the appropriate
election filed with the Internal Revenue Service exchanging mortgage
bond authority for mortgage credit certificate authority have been
issued or filed within one hundred twenty (120) days after the date
of such confirmation. No extensions shall be granted. Such
issuance shall be evidenced by the mailing, transmittal or delivery
of a final certification to the Deputy Treasurer for Debt Management
within the time specified by this subsection. Receipt by an issuer
of a confirmation as contemplated by this section shall entitle the
issuer to rely conclusively upon the accuracy of the Deputy
Treasurer for Debt Management's mathematical calculation and the
allocation for purposes of closing.
I. The confirmation given in advance of bond issuance or
mortgage credit certificate election will assure allocation for only
the amount of such bonds or mortgage credit certificate authority as
is therein set forth, unless a supplementary application for state
ceiling allocation for an increase in amount is filed with and a
supplementary confirmation is issued by the Deputy Treasurer for
ENR. H. B. NO. 1549 Page 16

Debt Management for such requested allocation prior to such bond
issuance or such election, pursuant to the Oklahoma Private Activity
Bond Allocation Act. The supplementary confirmation shall be
effective for the same period as the prior confirmation which it
supplements. Provided, however, no supplementary confirmation shall
be effective to preempt any intervening confirmation as to
allocation of a portion of the state ceiling.
J. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, all
confirmation dates for an issue of private activity bonds or
mortgage credit certificate programs expire on December 20 1 of each
calendar year. Final certification of issuance shall be delivered
to the Deputy Treasurer for Debt Management by 9:00 a.m. on December
20 1 of each calendar year.
K. On or after 9:00 a.m. on December 20 1 of each calendar
year, issuing authorities may apply to the Deputy Treasurer for Debt
Management to carry forward a portion of the state ceiling for such
calendar year allocated to any qualified carryforward project, as
said term is used in Section 103(n)(10) and 146(f) of the Internal
Revenue Code and which shall be evidenced by the issuance of
confirmations for all carryforward projects within the limitations
of the state ceiling. Provided, issuers or projects with more than
Twenty Million Dollars ($20,000,000.00) of carryforward outstanding
as of the date of the application for carryforward shall only be
eligible for carryforward allocations to the extent other issuers
with less than Twenty Million Dollars ($20,000,000.00) of
outstanding carryforward authority do not fully commit the state
ceiling. Allocations on carryforward projects shall be processed on
the basis of the chronological receipt of applications, subject to
paragraph 3 of subsection C of this section. No portion of the
state ceiling carried forward for any given year may be carried
forward for a period in excess of three (3) calendar years following
the calendar year in which the carryforward arose, except as
otherwise permitted under federal law.
L. The Deputy Treasurer for Debt Management shall maintain
continuous and cumulative records which shall include a list and
cumulative dollar total of the private activity bonds for which:
1. Private activity bonds have been issued or state ceiling
exchanged for mortgage credit certificate authority and final
certifications have been received by the Deputy Treasurer for Debt
Management;
ENR. H. B. NO. 1549 Page 17

2. Confirmations of carryforward have been issued; and
3. Confirmations in effect and outstanding for which no private
activity bonds or mortgage credit certificate elections have been
issued or filed.
The Deputy Treasurer for Debt Management shall keep continuous and
cumulative records and totals for each of the categories specified
in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of this subsection as well as the aggregate
total of all categories. The Deputy Treasurer for Debt Management
shall not give further confirmations at such time as the aggregate
amount of bonds, other indebtedness, carryforward or mortgage credit
certificate elections specified by paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of this
subsection equals the state ceiling authorized for the applicable
year. The Deputy Treasurer for Debt Management shall not award a
confirmation if such award would cause indebtedness, carryforward or
elections as specified by paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of this subsection
to exceed the state ceiling. Confirmation records shall be compiled
and furnished to any local issuer and state issuer upon written
request and payment of a fee of Fifteen Dollars ($15.00) which shall
be apportioned to the General Revenue Fund. Upon issuance of a
confirmation, the amounts of the proposed bond issue, mortgage
credit certificate election and carryforward confirmation shall be
included in the continuing, mathematical calculation, until the same
shall have been terminated in accordance with this section.
M. The person signing any confirmation for any allocations
granted pursuant to the Oklahoma Private Activity Bond Allocation
Act shall certify under penalty of perjury that such allocation was
not made in consideration of any bribe, gift, gratuity or direct or
indirect contribution to any political campaign.
N. A state or local issuer, who intentionally overissues
mortgage credit certificates or bonds, shall be prohibited from
making application for an allocation of the state ceiling for any
purpose for a period of three (3) years following discovery of such
over issuance.
SECTION 5. This act shall become effective November 1, 2025.
