7 certificate elections specified by paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of this
8 subsection equals the state ceiling authorized for the applicable
9 year. The Deputy Treasurer for Debt Management shall not award a
10 confirmation if such award would cause indebtedness, carryforward or
11 elections as specified by paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of this subsection
12 to exceed the state ceiling. Confirmation records shall be compiled
13 and furnished to any local issuer and state issuer upon written
14 request and payment of a fee of Fifteen Dollars ($15.00) which shall
15 be apportioned to the General Revenue Fund. Upon issuance of a

17 credit certificate election and carryforward confirmation shall be
18 included in the continuing, mathematical calculation, until the same
19 shall have been terminated in accordance with this section.

6 amount of bonds, other indebtedness, carryforward or mortgage credit
7 certificate elections specified by paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of this
8 subsection equals the state ceiling authorized for the applicable
9 year. The Deputy Treasurer for Debt Management shall not award a
10 confirmation if such award would cause indebtedness, carryforward or
11 elections as specified by paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of this subsection
12 to exceed the state ceiling. Confirmation records shall be compiled
13 and furnished to any local issuer and state issuer upon written
14 request and payment of a fee of Fifteen Dollars ($15.00) which shall
15 be apportioned to the General Revenue Fund. Upon issuance of a
16 confirmation, the amounts of the proposed bond issue, mortgage
17 credit certificate election and carryforward confirmation shall be
18 included in the continuing, mathematical calculation, until the same
19 shall have been terminated in accordance with this section.
