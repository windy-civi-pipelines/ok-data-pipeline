2
written schedule of the fees at its principal office and with the
2

4
In no case shall a search fee be charged when the release of
4
5
records is in the public interest, including, but not limited to,
5
6
release to the news media, scholars, authors and taxpayers seeking
6
7
to determine whether those entrusted with the affairs of the
7
8
government are honestly, faithfully, and competently performing
8
9
their duties as public servants.
9
10
The fees shall not be used for the purpose of discouraging
10
11
requests for information or as obstacles to disclosure of requested
11
12
information;
12
13

Section 18:
5. The land description tract index of all recorded instruments
13
14
concerning real property required to be kept by the county clerk of
14

reproduced for the purpose of sale of the information;
18
19

Section 19:
6. A public body must provide prompt, reasonable access to its
19
20
records but may establish reasonable procedures which protect the
20
21
integrity and organization of its records and to prevent excessive
21
22
disruptions of its essential functions. A delay in providing access
22

23
24
preparing the requested documents and the avoidance of excessive
24
Req. No. 66 Page 10
1
disruptions of the public body’s essential functions. In no event
1
2
may production of a current request for records be unreasonably
2
3
delayed until after completion of a prior records request that will
3
4
take substantially longer than the current request. Any public body
4
5
which makes the requested records available on the Internet shall
5
6
meet the obligation of providing prompt, reasonable access to its
6
7
records as required by this paragraph; and
7

Section 20:

8
9
authorized to release records of the public body for inspection,

5

release to the news media, scholars, authors and taxpayers seeking
6

to determine whether those entrusted with the affairs of the
7
8
government are honestly, faithfully, and competently performing
8
9
their duties as public servants.

6. A public body must provide prompt, reasonable access to its
19
20
records but may establish reasonable procedures which protect the

21
integrity and organization of its records and to prevent excessive
21
22
disruptions of its essential functions. A delay in providing access
22

disruptions of the public body’s essential functions. In no event
1
2
may production of a current request for records be unreasonably
2
3
delayed until after completion of a prior records request that will
3
4
take substantially longer than the current request. Any public body
4
5
which makes the requested records available on the Internet shall
5
6
meet the obligation of providing prompt, reasonable access to its
6
7
records as required by this paragraph; and
7
8
7. A public body shall designate certain persons who are
8

authorized to release records of the public body for inspection,
