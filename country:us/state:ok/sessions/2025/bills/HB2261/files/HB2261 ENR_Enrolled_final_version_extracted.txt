effectively and efficiently implement and administer the purposes
and provisions of the Compact. A Rule shall be invalid and have no

authority in a manner that is beyond the scope and purposes of the
Compact, or the powers granted hereunder, or based upon another
applicable standard of review.

each Member State, provided, however, that where the Rules of the
Commission conflict with the laws of the Member State that establish

jurisdiction, the Rules of the Commission shall be ineffective in
that State to the extent of the conflict.

the full text of the Rule.

challenge shall be made in writing and delivered to the Commission
prior to the end of the notice period. If no challenge is made, the
revision will take effect without further action. If the revision
is challenged, the revision may not take effect without the approval
of the Commission.

default.

Section 127:
2. The Commission shall provide a copy of the notice of default
to the other Member States.
C. If a State in default fails to cure the default, the
defaulting State may be terminated from the Compact upon an
affirmative vote of a majority of the delegates of the Member

State by this Compact may be terminated on the effective date of
termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending
State of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of
default.
D. Termination of membership in the Compact shall be imposed
only after all other means of securing compliance have been
exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given
by the Commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders

promulgated Rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive
relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary,
the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation,

Member State’s law.

Section 131:
2. A Member State may initiate legal action against the
Commission in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia

shall be entitled to the default process set forth in

Section 135:
Section 13 of this act.

Commission shall remain in existence and the Compact
shall remain in effect even if the number of Member
States should be less than seven.

Section 136:
2. Member States enacting the Compact subsequent to the seven
initial Charter Member States shall be subject to the process set

government, agency, person, or circumstance is held to be
unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, the validity
of the remainder of this Compact and the applicability thereof to

may deny a State’s participation in the Compact or, in accordance
with the requirements of subsection C of Section 13 of this act,
terminate a Member State’s participation in the Compact, if it
determines that a constitutional requirement of a Member State is a
material departure from the Compact. Otherwise, if this Compact
shall be held to be contrary to the constitution of any Member

remaining Member States and in full force and effect as to the
Member State affected as to all severable matters.

director, employee, and representative of the Commission in any

pursuant to this Compact or through the Data System, when certified
by the Commission or an agent thereof, shall constitute the
authenticated business records of the Commission, and shall be
entitled to any associated hearsay exception in any relevant
judicial, quasi-judicial or administrative proceedings in a Member
State.
ENR. H. B. NO. 2261 Page 25

E. Current Significant Investigative Information pertaining to
a Licensee in any Member State will only be available to other
Member States.
It is the responsibility of the Member States to report any

State will be available to any other Member State.
F. Member States contributing information to the Data System
may designate information that may not be shared with the public
without the express permission of the contributing State.

Data System.
SECTION 12. NEW LAW A new section of law to be codified
in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 1292 of Title 59, unless there
is created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:
A. The Commission shall promulgate reasonable Rules in order to
effectively and efficiently implement and administer the purposes
and provisions of the Compact. A Rule shall be invalid and have no
force or effect only if a court of competent jurisdiction holds that
the Rule is invalid because the Commission exercised its rulemaking
authority in a manner that is beyond the scope and purposes of the
Compact, or the powers granted hereunder, or based upon another
applicable standard of review.
B. The Rules of the Commission shall have the force of law in
each Member State, provided, however, that where the Rules of the
Commission conflict with the laws of the Member State that establish
the Member State’s laws, regulations, and applicable standards that
govern the practice of Social Work as held by a court of competent
jurisdiction, the Rules of the Commission shall be ineffective in
that State to the extent of the conflict.
C. The Commission shall exercise its Rulemaking powers pursuant
to the criteria set forth in this section and the Rules adopted
thereunder. Rules shall become binding on the day following
adoption or the date specified in the rule or amendment, whichever
is later.
ENR. H. B. NO. 2261 Page 26

D. If a majority of the legislatures of the Member States
rejects a Rule or portion of a Rule, by enactment of a statute or
resolution in the same manner used to adopt the Compact within four
(4) years of the date of adoption of the Rule, then such Rule shall
have no further force and effect in any Member State.
E. Rules shall be adopted at a regular or special meeting of
the Commission.
F. Prior to adoption of a proposed Rule, the Commission shall
hold a public hearing and allow persons to provide oral and written
comments, data, facts, opinions, and arguments.
G. Prior to adoption of a proposed Rule by the Commission, and
at least thirty (30) days in advance of the meeting at which the
Commission will hold a public hearing on the proposed Rule, the
Commission shall provide a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking:
1. On the website of the Commission or other publicly

notices of proposed rulemaking; and
3. In such other way(s) as the Commission may by Rule specify.
H. The Notice of Proposed Rulemaking shall include:

the Commission will hear public comments on the proposed Rule and,
if different, the time, date, and location of the meeting where the

2. If the hearing is held via telecommunication,
videoconference, or other electronic means, the Commission shall
include the mechanism for access to the hearing in the Notice of

comments.
I. All hearings will be recorded. A copy of the recording and
all written comments and documents received by the Commission in
response to the proposed Rule shall be available to the public.
J. Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a
separate hearing on each Rule. Rules may be grouped for the
convenience of the Commission at hearings required by this section.
K. The Commission shall, by majority vote of all members, take
final action on the proposed Rule based on the Rulemaking record and
the full text of the Rule.
1. The Commission may adopt changes to the proposed Rule
provided the changes do not enlarge the original purpose of the
proposed Rule.
2. The Commission shall provide an explanation of the reasons
for substantive changes made to the proposed Rule as well as reasons
for substantive changes not made that were recommended by
commenters.
3. The Commission shall determine a reasonable effective date
for the Rule. Except for an emergency as provided in subsection L
of this section, the effective date of the Rule shall be no sooner
than thirty (30) days after issuing the notice that it adopted or
amended the Rule.
L. Upon determination that an emergency exists, the Commission
may consider and adopt an emergency Rule with forty-eight (48)
hours’ notice, with opportunity to comment, provided that the usual
Rulemaking procedures provided in the Compact and in this section
shall be retroactively applied to the Rule as soon as reasonably
possible, in no event later than ninety (90) days after the
effective date of the Rule. For the purposes of this provision, an
emergency Rule is one that must be adopted immediately in order to:
1. Meet an imminent threat to public health, safety, or
welfare;
2. Prevent a loss of Commission or Member State funds;
ENR. H. B. NO. 2261 Page 28

shall be subject to challenge by any person for a period of thirty
(30) days after posting. The revision may be challenged only on
grounds that the revision results in a material change to a Rule. A
challenge shall be made in writing and delivered to the Commission
prior to the end of the notice period. If no challenge is made, the
revision will take effect without further action. If the revision
is challenged, the revision may not take effect without the approval
of the Commission.

this Compact.
SECTION 13. NEW LAW A new section of law to be codified
in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 1293 of Title 59, unless there

A. Oversight:
1. The executive and judicial branches of State government in
each Member State shall enforce this Compact and take all actions
necessary and appropriate to implement the Compact.
2. Except as otherwise provided in this Compact, venue is
proper and judicial proceedings by or against the Commission shall
be brought solely and exclusively in a court of competent
jurisdiction where the principal office of the Commission is
located. The Commission may waive venue and jurisdictional defenses
to the extent it adopts or consents to participate in alternative
dispute resolution proceedings. Nothing herein shall affect or
limit the selection or propriety of venue in any action against a
Licensee for professional malpractice, misconduct or any such
similar matter.
3. The Commission shall be entitled to receive service of
process in any proceeding regarding the enforcement or
ENR. H. B. NO. 2261 Page 29

interpretation of the Compact and shall have standing to intervene
in such a proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide the
Commission service of process shall render a judgment or order void
as to the Commission, this Compact, or promulgated Rules.
B. Default, Technical Assistance, and Termination:
1. If the Commission determines that a Member State has
defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities
under this Compact or the promulgated Rules, the Commission shall
provide written notice to the defaulting State. The notice of
default shall describe the default, the proposed means of curing the
default, and any other action that the Commission may take, and
shall offer training and specific technical assistance regarding the
default.
2. The Commission shall provide a copy of the notice of default
to the other Member States.
C. If a State in default fails to cure the default, the
defaulting State may be terminated from the Compact upon an
affirmative vote of a majority of the delegates of the Member
States, and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred on that
State by this Compact may be terminated on the effective date of
termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending
State of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of
default.
D. Termination of membership in the Compact shall be imposed
only after all other means of securing compliance have been
exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given
by the Commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders
of the defaulting State’s legislature, the defaulting State’s State
Licensing Authority and each of the Member States’ State Licensing
Authority.
E. A State that has been terminated is responsible for all
assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the
effective date of termination, including obligations that extend
beyond the effective date of termination.
F. Upon the termination of a State’s membership from this
Compact, that State shall immediately provide notice to all
Licensees within that State of such termination. The terminated
State shall continue to recognize all licenses granted pursuant to
ENR. H. B. NO. 2261 Page 30

this Compact for a minimum of six (6) months after the date of said
notice of termination.
G. The Commission shall not bear any costs related to a State
that is found to be in default or that has been terminated from the
Compact, unless agreed upon in writing between the Commission and
the defaulting State.
H. The defaulting State may appeal the action of the Commission
by petitioning the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia
or the federal district where the Commission has its principal
offices. The prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such
litigation, including reasonable attorney’s fees.
I. Dispute Resolution:
1. Upon request by a Member State, the Commission shall attempt
to resolve disputes related to the Compact that arise among Member
States and between Member and non-Member States.
2. The Commission shall promulgate a Rule providing for both
mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes as
appropriate.
J. Enforcement:
1. By majority vote as provided by Rule, the Commission may
initiate legal action against a Member State in default in the
United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the
federal district where the Commission has its principal offices to
enforce compliance with the provisions of the Compact and its
promulgated Rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive
relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary,
the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation,
including reasonable attorney’s fees. The remedies herein shall not
be the exclusive remedies of the Commission. The Commission may
pursue any other remedies available under federal or the defaulting
Member State’s law.
2. A Member State may initiate legal action against the
Commission in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia
or the federal district where the Commission has its principal
offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the Compact and
its promulgated Rules. The relief sought may include both
injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is
ENR. H. B. NO. 2261 Page 31

necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such
litigation, including reasonable attorney’s fees.
3. No person other than a Member State shall enforce this
Compact against the Commission.
SECTION 14. NEW LAW A new section of law to be codified
in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 1294 of Title 59, unless there
is created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:
A. The Compact shall come into effect on the date on which the
Compact statute is enacted into law in the seventh Member State.
1. On or after the effective date of the Compact, the
Commission shall convene and review the enactment of each of the
first seven Member States (“Charter Member States”) to determine if
the statute enacted by each such Charter Member State is materially
different than the model Compact statute.
a. A Charter Member State whose enactment is found to be
materially different from the model Compact statute
shall be entitled to the default process set forth in
Section 13 of this act.
b. If any Member State is later found to be in default,
or is terminated or withdraws from the Compact, the
Commission shall remain in existence and the Compact
shall remain in effect even if the number of Member
States should be less than seven.
2. Member States enacting the Compact subsequent to the seven
initial Charter Member States shall be subject to the process set
forth in paragraph 21 of subsection C of Section 10 of this act to
determine if their enactments are materially different from the
model Compact statute and whether they qualify for participation in
the Compact.
3. All actions taken for the benefit of the Commission or in
furtherance of the purposes of the administration of the Compact
prior to the effective date of the Compact or the Commission coming
into existence shall be considered to be actions of the Commission
unless specifically repudiated by the Commission.
4. Any State that joins the Compact subsequent to the
Commission’s initial adoption of the Rules and bylaws shall be
ENR. H. B. NO. 2261 Page 32

subject to the Rules and bylaws as they exist on the date on which
the Compact becomes law in that State. Any Rule that has been
previously adopted by the Commission shall have the full force and
effect of law on the day the Compact becomes law in that State.
B. Any Member State may withdraw from this Compact by enacting
a statute repealing the same.
1. A Member State’s withdrawal shall not take effect until one
hundred eighty (180) days after enactment of the repealing statute.
2. Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirement of
the withdrawing State’s Licensing Authority to comply with the
investigative and Adverse Action reporting requirements of this
Compact prior to the effective date of withdrawal.
3. Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing from this
Compact, a State shall immediately provide notice of such withdrawal
to all Licensees within that State. Notwithstanding any subsequent
statutory enactment to the contrary, such withdrawing State shall
continue to recognize all licenses granted pursuant to this Compact
for a minimum of one hundred eighty (180) days after the date of
such notice of withdrawal.
C. Nothing contained in this Compact shall be construed to
invalidate or prevent any licensure agreement or other cooperative
arrangement between a Member State and a non-Member State that does
not conflict with the provisions of this Compact.
D. This Compact may be amended by the Member States. No
amendment to this Compact shall become effective and binding upon
any Member State until it is enacted into the laws of all Member
States.
SECTION 15. NEW LAW A new section of law to be codified
in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 1295 of Title 59, unless there
is created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:
A. This Compact and the Commission’s rulemaking authority shall
be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes and the
implementation and administration of the Compact. Provisions of the
Compact expressly authorizing or requiring the promulgation of Rules
shall not be construed to limit the Commission’s rulemaking
authority solely for those purposes.
ENR. H. B. NO. 2261 Page 33

B. The provisions of this Compact shall be severable and if any
phrase, clause, sentence, or provision of this Compact is held by a
court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to the constitution
of any Member State, a State seeking participation in the Compact,
or of the United States, or the applicability thereof to any
government, agency, person, or circumstance is held to be
unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, the validity
of the remainder of this Compact and the applicability thereof to
any other government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be
affected thereby.
C. Notwithstanding subsection B of this section, the Commission
may deny a State’s participation in the Compact or, in accordance
with the requirements of subsection C of Section 13 of this act,
terminate a Member State’s participation in the Compact, if it
determines that a constitutional requirement of a Member State is a
material departure from the Compact. Otherwise, if this Compact
shall be held to be contrary to the constitution of any Member
State, the Compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the
remaining Member States and in full force and effect as to the
Member State affected as to all severable matters.
SECTION 16. NEW LAW A new section of law to be codified
in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 1296 of Title 59, unless there
is created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:

Multistate Authorization to Practice shall adhere to the laws and
regulations, including laws, regulations, and applicable standards,
of the Remote State where the client is located at the time care is
rendered.
B. Nothing herein shall prevent or inhibit the enforcement of
any other law of a Member State that is not inconsistent with the
Compact.
C. Any laws, statutes, regulations, or other legal requirements
in a Member State in conflict with the Compact are superseded to the
extent of the conflict.
D. All permissible agreements between the Commission and the
