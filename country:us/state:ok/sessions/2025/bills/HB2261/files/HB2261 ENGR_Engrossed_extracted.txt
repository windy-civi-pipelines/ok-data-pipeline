19 Compact, or the powers granted hereunder, or based upon another
20 applicable standard of review.
21 B. The Rules of the Commission shall have the force of law in

12 (4) years of the date of adoption of the Rule, then such Rule shall
13 have no further force and effect in any Member State.
14 E. Rules shall be adopted at a regular or special meeting of

ENGR. H. B. NO. 2261 Page 41
1 A. Oversight
2 1. The executive and judicial branches of State government in
3 each Member State shall enforce this Compact and take all actions
4 necessary and appropriate to implement the Compact.
5 2. Except as otherwise provided in this Compact, venue is
6 proper and judicial proceedings by or against the Commission shall
7 be brought solely and exclusively in a court of competent
8 jurisdiction where the principal office of the Commission is
9 located. The Commission may waive venue and jurisdictional defenses
10 to the extent it adopts or consents to participate in alternative
11 dispute resolution proceedings. Nothing herein shall affect or
12 limit the selection or propriety of venue in any action against a
13 Licensee for professional malpractice, misconduct or any such
14 similar matter.
15 3. The Commission shall be entitled to receive service of
16 process in any proceeding regarding the enforcement or
17 interpretation of the Compact and shall have standing to intervene
18 in such a proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide the
19 Commission service of process shall render a judgment or order void
20 as to the Commission, this Compact, or promulgated Rules.
21 B. Default, Technical Assistance, and Termination
22 1. If the Commission determines that a Member State has
23 defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities

1 prov ide written notice to the defaulting State. The notice of
2 default shall describe the default, the proposed means of curing the
3 default, and any other action that the Commission may take, and
4 shall offer training and specific technical assistance regarding the
5 default.
6 2. The Commission shall provide a copy of the notice of default
7 to the other Member States.
8 C. If a State in default fails to cure the default, the
9 defaulting State may be terminated from the Compact upon an
10 affirmative vote of a majority of the delegates of the Member
11 States, and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred on that
12 State by this Compact may be terminated on the effective date of
13 termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending
14 State of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of
15 default.
16 D. Termination of membership in the Compact shall be imposed
17 only after all other means of securing compliance have been
18 exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given
19 by the Commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders
20 of the defaulting State’s legislature, the defaulting State’s State
21 Licensing Authority and each of the Member States’ State Licensing
22 Authority.
23 E. A State that has been terminated is responsible for all
24 assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2261 Page 43

10 SECTION 12. NEW LAW A new section of law to be codified
11 in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 1292 of Title 59, unless there
12 is created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:
13 A. The Commission shall promulgate reasonable Rules in order to
14 effectively and efficiently implement and administer the purposes
15 and provisions of the Compact. A Rule shall be invalid and have no
16 force or effect only if a court of competent jurisdiction holds that
17 the Rule is invalid because the Commission exercised its rulemaking
18 authority in a manner that is beyond the scope and purposes of the
19 Compact, or the powers granted hereunder, or based upon another
20 applicable standard of review.
21 B. The Rules of the Commission shall have the force of law in
22 each Member State, provided, however, that where the Rules of the
23 Commission conflict with the laws of the Member State that establish
24 the Member State’s laws, regulations, and applicable standards that
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2261 Page 37

1 gove rn the practice of Social Work as held by a court of competent
2 jurisdiction, the Rules of the Commission shall be ineffective in
3 that State to the extent of the conflict.
4 C. The Commission shall exercise its Rulemaking powers pursuant
5 to the criteria set forth in this section and the Rules adopted
6 thereunder. Rules shall become binding on the day following
7 adoption or the date specified in the rule or amendment, whichever
8 is later.
9 D. If a majority of the legislatures of the Member States
10 rejects a Rule or portion of a Rule, by enactment of a statute or
11 resolution in the same manner used to adopt the Compact within four
12 (4) years of the date of adoption of the Rule, then such Rule shall
13 have no further force and effect in any Member State.
14 E. Rules shall be adopted at a regular or special meeting of
15 the Commission.
16 F. Prior to adoption of a proposed Rule, the Commission shall
17 hold a public hearing and allow persons to provide oral and written
18 comments, data, facts, opinions, and arguments.

20 at least thirty (30) days in advance of the meeting at which the
21 Commission will hold a public hearing on the proposed Rule, the
22 Commission shall provide a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking:
23 1. On the website of the Commission or other publicly
24 accessible platform;
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2261 Page 38

1 2. To persons who have requested notice of the Commission’s
2 notices of proposed rulemaking; and
3 3. In such other way(s) as the Commission may by Rule specify.
4 H. The Notice of Proposed Rulemaking shall include:
5 1. The time, date, and location of the public hearing at which
6 the Commission will hear public comments on the proposed Rule and,
7 if different, the time, date, and location of the meeting where the
8 Commission will consider and vote on the proposed Rule;
9 2. If the hearing is held via telecommunication,
10 videoconference, or other electronic means, the Commission shall
11 include the mechanism for access to the hearing in the Notice of
12 Proposed Rulemaking;
13 3. The text of the proposed Rule and the reason therefor;
14 4. A request for comments on the proposed Rule from any
15 interested person; and
16 5. The manner in which interested persons may submit written
17 comments.
18 I. All hearings will be recorded. A copy of the recording and
19 all written comments and documents received by the Commission in
20 response to the proposed Rule shall be available to the public.
21 J. Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a
22 separate hearing on each Rule. Rules may be grouped for the
23 convenience of the Commission at hearings required by this section.
24
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2261 Page 39

1 K. The Commission shall, by majority vote of all members, take
2 final action on the proposed Rule based on the Rulemaking record and
3 the full text of the Rule.
4 1. The Commission may adopt changes to the proposed Rule
5 provided the changes do not enlarge the original purpose of the
6 proposed Rule.
7 2. The Commission shall provide an explanation of the reasons
8 for substantive changes made to the proposed Rule as well as reasons
9 for substantive changes not made that were recommended by
10 commenters.
11 3. The Commission shall determine a reasonable effective date
12 for the Rule. Except for an emergency as provided in subsection L
13 of this section, the effective date of the Rule shall be no sooner
14 than thirty (30) days after issuing the notice that it adopted or
15 amended the Rule.
16 L. Upon determination that an emergency exists, the Commission
17 may consider and adopt an emergency Rule with forty-eight (48)
18 hours’ notice, with opportunity to comment, provided that the usual
19 Rulemaking procedures provided in the Compact and in this section
20 shall be retroactively applied to the Rule as soon as reasonably
21 possible, in no event later than ninety (90) days after the
22 effective date of the Rule. For the purposes of this provision, an
23 emergency Rule is one that must be adopted immediately in order to:
24
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2261 Page 40

1 1. Meet an imminent threat to public health, safety, or
2 welfare;
3 2. Prevent a loss of Commission or Member State funds;
4 3. Meet a deadline for the promulgation of a Rule that is
5 established by federal law or rule; or
6 4. Protect public health and safety.
7 M. The Commission or an authorized committee of the Commission
8 may direct revisions to a previously adopted Rule for purposes of
9 correcting typographical errors, errors in format, errors in
10 consistency, or grammatical errors. Public notice of any revisions
11 shall be posted on the website of the Commission. The revision
12 shall be subject to challenge by any person for a period of thirty
13 (30) days after posting. The revision may be challenged only on
14 grounds that the revision results in a material change to a Rule. A
15 challenge shall be made in writing and delivered to the Commission
16 prior to the end of the notice period. If no challenge is made, the
17 revision will take effect without further action. If the revision
18 is challenged, the revision may not take effect without the approval
19 of the Commission.
20 N. No Member State’s rulemaking requirements shall apply under
21 this Compact.
22 SECTION 13. NEW LAW A new section of law to be codified
23 in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 1293 of Title 59, unless there

3 each Member State shall enforce this Compact and take all actions
4 necessary and appropriate to implement the Compact.
5 2. Except as otherwise provided in this Compact, venue is
6 proper and judicial proceedings by or against the Commission shall
7 be brought solely and exclusively in a court of competent
8 jurisdiction where the principal office of the Commission is
9 located. The Commission may waive venue and jurisdictional defenses
10 to the extent it adopts or consents to participate in alternative
11 dispute resolution proceedings. Nothing herein shall affect or
12 limit the selection or propriety of venue in any action against a
13 Licensee for professional malpractice, misconduct or any such
14 similar matter.
15 3. The Commission shall be entitled to receive service of
16 process in any proceeding regarding the enforcement or
17 interpretation of the Compact and shall have standing to intervene
18 in such a proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide the
19 Commission service of process shall render a judgment or order void
20 as to the Commission, this Compact, or promulgated Rules.
21 B. Default, Technical Assistance, and Termination
22 1. If the Commission determines that a Member State has
23 defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities
24 under this Compact or the promulgated Rules, the Commission shall
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2261 Page 42

1 prov ide written notice to the defaulting State. The notice of
2 default shall describe the default, the proposed means of curing the
3 default, and any other action that the Commission may take, and
4 shall offer training and specific technical assistance regarding the
5 default.
6 2. The Commission shall provide a copy of the notice of default
7 to the other Member States.
8 C. If a State in default fails to cure the default, the
9 defaulting State may be terminated from the Compact upon an
10 affirmative vote of a majority of the delegates of the Member
11 States, and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred on that
12 State by this Compact may be terminated on the effective date of
13 termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending
14 State of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of
15 default.
16 D. Termination of membership in the Compact shall be imposed
17 only after all other means of securing compliance have been
18 exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given
19 by the Commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders
20 of the defaulting State’s legislature, the defaulting State’s State
21 Licensing Authority and each of the Member States’ State Licensing
22 Authority.
23 E. A State that has been terminated is responsible for all
24 assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the

2 beyond the effective date of termination.
3 F. Upon the termination of a State’s membership from this
4 Compact, that State shall immediately provide notice to all

8 notice of termination.

10 that is found to be in default or that has been terminated from the
11 Compact, unless agreed upon in writing between the Commission and
12 the defaulting State.
13 H. The defaulting State may appeal the action of the Commission
14 by petitioning the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia
15 or the federal district where the Commission has its principal
16 offices. The prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such
17 litigation, including reasonable attorney’s fees.
18 I. Dispute Resolution
19 1. Upon request by a Member State, the Commission shall attempt
20 to resolve disputes related to the Compact that arise among Member
21 States and between Member and non-Member States.
22 2. The Commission shall promulgate a Rule providing for both
23 mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes as
24 appropriate.
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2261 Page 44

1 J. Enforcement
2 1. By majority vote as provided by Rule, the Commission may
3 initiate legal action against a Member State in default in the
4 United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the
5 federal district where the Commission has its principal offices to
6 enforce compliance with the provisions of the Compact and its
7 promulgated Rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive
8 relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary,
9 the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation,
10 including reasonable attorney’s fees. The remedies herein shall not
11 be the exclusive remedies of the Commission. The Commission may
12 pursue any other remedies available under federal or the defaulting
13 Member State’s law.
14 2. A Member State may initiate legal action against the
15 Commission in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia
16 or the federal district where the Commission has its principal
17 offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the Compact and
18 its promulgated Rules. The relief sought may include both
19 injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is
20 necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such
21 litigation, including reasonable attorney’s fees.

23 Compact against the Commission.
24

4 A. The Compact shall come into effect on the date on which the
5 Compact statute is enacted into law in the seventh Member State.
6 1. On or after the effective date of the Compact, the

8 first seven Member States (“Charter Member States”) to determine if
9 the statute enacted by each such Charter Member State is materially
10 different than the model Compact statute.
11 a. A Charter Member State whose enactment is found to be
12 materially different from the model Compact statute
13 shall be entitled to the default process set forth in
14 Section 13 of this act.

16 or is terminated or withdraws from the Compact, the
17 Commission shall remain in existence and the Compact

20 2. Member States enacting the Compact subsequent to the seven
21 initial Charter Member States shall be subject to the process set
22 forth in paragraph 21 of subsection C of Section 10 of this act to
23 determine if their enactments are materially different from the
24
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2261 Page 46

1 mode l Compact statute and whether they qualify for participation in
2 the Compact.
3 3. All actions taken for the benefit of the Commission or in
4 furtherance of the purposes of the administration of the Compact
5 prior to the effective date of the Compact or the Commission coming
6 into existence shall be considered to be actions of the Commission
7 unless specifically repudiated by the Commission.
8 4. Any State that joins the Compact subsequent to the
9 Commission’s initial adoption of the Rules and bylaws shall be
10 subject to the Rules and bylaws as they exist on the date on which

12 previously adopted by the Commission shall have the full force and
13 effect of law on the day the Compact becomes law in that State.
14 B. Any Member State may withdraw from this Compact by enacting
15 a statute repealing the same.
16 1. A Member State’s withdrawal shall not take effect until one
17 hundred eighty (180) days after enactment of the repealing statute.

19 the withdrawing State’s Licensing Authority to comply with the
20 investigative and Adverse Action reporting requirements of this
21 Compact prior to the effective date of withdrawal.
22 3. Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing from this
23 Compact, a State shall immediately provide notice of such withdrawal
24 to all Licensees within that State. Notwithstanding any subsequent
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2261 Page 47

2 continue to recognize all licenses granted pursuant to this Compact
3 for a minimum of one hundred eighty (180) days after the date of
4 such notice of withdrawal.

6 invalidate or prevent any licensure agreement or other cooperative
7 arrangement between a Member State and a non-Member State that does
8 not conflict with the provisions of this Compact.

10 amendment to this Compact shall become effective and binding upon

12 States.
13 SECTION 15. NEW LAW A new section of law to be codified
14 in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 1295 of Title 59, unless there
15 is created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:
16 A. This Compact and the Commission’s rulemaking authority shall
17 be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes and the
18 implementation and administration of the Compact. Provisions of the
19 Compact expressly authorizing or requiring the promulgation of Rules
20 shall not be construed to limit the Commission’s rulemaking
21 authority solely for those purposes.
22 B. The provisions of this Compact shall be severable and if any
23 phrase, clause, sentence, or provision of this Compact is held by a
24 court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to the constitution
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2261 Page 48

1 of a ny Member State, a State seeking participation in the Compact,
2 or of the United States, or the applicability thereof to any
3 government, agency, person, or circumstance is held to be

6 any other government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be
7 affected thereby.
8 C. Notwithstanding subsection B of this section, the Commission
9 may deny a State’s participation in the Compact or, in accordance
10 with the requirements of subsection C of Section 13 of this act,
11 terminate a Member State’s participation in the Compact, if it
12 determines that a constitutional requirement of a Member State is a
13 material departure from the Compact. Otherwise, if this Compact
14 shall be held to be contrary to the constitution of any Member
15 State, the Compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the
16 remaining Member States and in full force and effect as to the
17 Member State affected as to all severable matters.
18 SECTION 16. NEW LAW A new section of law to be codified
19 in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 1296 of Title 59, unless there
20 is created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:
