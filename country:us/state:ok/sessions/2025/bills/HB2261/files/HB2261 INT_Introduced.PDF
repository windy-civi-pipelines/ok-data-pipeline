15 process in any proceeding regarding the enforcement or

17 exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given

14 force or effect only if a court of competent jurisdiction holds that
15 the Rule is invalid because the Commission exercised its rulemaking
16 authority in a manner that is beyond the scope and purposes of the
17 Compact, or the powers granted hereunder, or based upon another
18 applicable standard of review.
19 B. The Rules of the Commission shall have the force of law in
20 each Member State, provided however that where the Rules of the
21 Commission conflict with the laws of the Member State that establish
22 the Member State’s laws, regulations, and applicable standards that
23 govern the practice of Social Work as held by a court of competent
24
Req. No. 10945 Page 37

7 is later.
8 D. If a majority of the legislatures of the Member States
9 rejects a Rule or portion of a Rule, by enactment of a statute or
10 resolution in the same manner used to adopt the Compact within four
11 (4) years of the date of adoption of the Rule, then such Rule shall
12 have no further force and effect in any Member State.
13 E. Rules shall be adopted at a regular or special meeting of
14 the Commission.
15 F. Prior to adoption of a proposed Rule, the Commission shall
16 hold a public hearing and allow persons to provide oral and written
17 comments, data, facts, opinions, and arguments.

19 at least thirty (30) days in advance of the meeting at which the
20 Commission will hold a public hearing on the proposed Rule, the
21 Commission shall provide a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking:
22 1. On the website of the Commission or other publicly
23 accessible platform;
24
Req. No. 10945 Page 38

1 2. To persons who have requested notice of the Commission’s
2 notices of proposed rulemaking; and
3 3. In such other way(s) as the Commission may by Rule specify.
4 H. The Notice of Proposed Rulemaking shall include:
5 1. The time, date, and location of the public hearing at which
6 the Commission will hear public comments on the proposed Rule and,
7 if different, the time, date, and location of the meeting where the
8 Commission will consider and vote on the proposed Rule;
9 2. If the hearing is held via telecommunication,
10 videoconference, or other electronic means, the Commission shall
11 include the mechanism for access to the hearing in the Notice of
12 Proposed Rulemaking;
13 3. The text of the proposed Rule and the reason therefor;
14 4. A request for comments on the proposed Rule from any
15 interested person; and
16 5. The manner in which interested persons may submit written
17 comments.
18 I. All hearings will be recorded. A copy of the recording and
19 all written comments and documents received by the Commission in
20 response to the proposed Rule shall be available to the public.
21 J. Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a
22 separate hearing on each Rule. Rules may be grouped for the
23 convenience of the Commission at hearings required by this section.
24
Req. No. 10945 Page 39

1 K. The Commission shall, by majority vote of all members, take
2 final action on the proposed Rule based on the Rulemaking record and
3 the full text of the Rule.
4 1. The Commission may adopt changes to the proposed Rule
5 provided the changes do not enlarge the original purpose of the
6 proposed Rule.
7 2. The Commission shall provide an explanation of the reasons
8 for substantive changes made to the proposed Rule as well as reasons
9 for substantive changes not made that were recommended by
10 commenters.
11 3. The Commission shall determine a reasonable effective date
12 for the Rule. Except for an emergency as provided in Section 12.L,
13 the effective date of the rule shall be no sooner than thirty (30)
14 days after issuing the notice that it adopted or amended the Rule.
15 L. Upon determination that an emergency exists, the Commission
16 may consider and adopt an emergency Rule with forty-eight (48)
17 hours’ notice, with opportunity to comment, provided that the usual
18 Rulemaking procedures provided in the Compact and in this section
19 shall be retroactively applied to the Rule as soon as reasonably
20 possible, in no event later than ninety (90) days after the
21 effective date of the Rule. For the purposes of this provision, an
22 emergency Rule is one that must be adopted immediately in order to:
23 1. Meet an imminent threat to public health, safety, or
24 welfare;
Req. No. 10945 Page 40

1 2. Prevent a loss of Commission or Member State funds;
2 3. Meet a deadline for the promulgation of a Rule that is
3 established by federal law or rule; or
4 4. Protect public health and safety.
5 M. The Commission or an authorized committee of the Commission
6 may direct revisions to a previously adopted Rule for purposes of
7 correcting typographical errors, errors in format, errors in
8 consistency, or grammatical errors. Public notice of any revisions
9 shall be posted on the website of the Commission. The revision
10 shall be subject to challenge by any person for a period of thirty
11 (30) days after posting. The revision may be challenged only on
12 grounds that the revision results in a material change to a Rule. A
13 challenge shall be made in writing and delivered to the Commission
14 prior to the end of the notice period. If no challenge is made, the
15 revision will take effect without further action. If the revision
16 is challenged, the revision may not take effect without the approval
17 of the Commission.
18 N. No Member State’s rulemaking requirements shall apply under
19 this compact.
20 SECTION 13. NEW LAW A new section of law to be codified

24
Req. No. 10945 Page 41

1 1. The executive and judicial branches of State government in
2 each Member State shall enforce this Compact and take all actions
3 necessary and appropriate to implement the Compact.
4 2. Except as otherwise provided in this Compact, venue is
5 proper and judicial proceedings by or against the Commission shall
6 be brought solely and exclusively in a court of competent
7 jurisdiction where the principal office of the Commission is
8 located. The Commission may waive venue and jurisdictional defenses
9 to the extent it adopts or consents to participate in alternative
10 dispute resolution proceedings. Nothing herein shall affect or
11 limit the selection or propriety of venue in any action against a
12 Licensee for professional malpractice, misconduct or any such
13 similar matter.
14 3. The Commission shall be entitled to receive service of
15 process in any proceeding regarding the enforcement or
16 interpretation of the Compact and shall have standing to intervene
17 in such a proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide the
18 Commission service of process shall render a judgment or order void
19 as to the Commission, this Compact, or promulgated Rules.
20 B. Default, Technical Assistance, and Termination
21 1. If the Commission determines that a Member State has
22 defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities

6 to the other Member States.
7 C. If a State in default fails to cure the default, the
8 defaulting State may be terminated from the Compact upon an
9 affirmative vote of a majority of the delegates of the Member
10 States, and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred on that
11 State by this Compact may be terminated on the effective date of
12 termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending
13 State of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of
14 default.
15 D. Termination of membership in the Compact shall be imposed
16 only after all other means of securing compliance have been
17 exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given
18 by the Commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders
19 of the defaulting State’s legislature, the defaulting State’s State
20 Licensing Authority and each of the Member States’ State Licensing
21 Authority.
22 E. A State that has been terminated is responsible for all

8 notice of termination.

12 the defaulting State.
13 H. The defaulting State may appeal the action of the Commission
14 by petitioning the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia
15 or the federal district where the Commission has its principal
16 offices. The prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such
17 litigation, including reasonable attorney’s fees.
18 I. Dispute Resolution
19 1. Upon request by a Member State, the Commission shall attempt
20 to resolve disputes related to the Compact that arise among Member
21 States and between Member and non-Member States.
22 2. The Commission shall promulgate a Rule providing for both
23 mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes as
24 appropriate.
Req. No. 10945 Page 44

1 J. Enforcement
2 1. By majority vote as provided by Rule, the Commission may
3 initiate legal action against a Member State in default in the
4 United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the
5 federal district where the Commission has its principal offices to
6 enforce compliance with the provisions of the Compact and its
7 promulgated Rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive
8 relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary,
9 the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation,
10 including reasonable attorney’s fees. The remedies herein shall not
11 be the exclusive remedies of the Commission. The Commission may
12 pursue any other remedies available under federal or the defaulting
13 Member State’s law.
14 2. A Member State may initiate legal action against the
15 Commission in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia
16 or the federal district where the Commission has its principal
17 offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the Compact and
18 its promulgated Rules. The relief sought may include both
19 injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is
20 necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such

23 compact against the Commission.

2 in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 1294 of Title 59, unless there
3 is created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:
4 A. The Compact shall come into effect on the date on which the
5 Compact statute is enacted into law in the seventh Member State.
6 1. On or after the effective date of the Compact, the

8 first seven Member States (“Charter Member States”) to determine if
9 the statute enacted by each such Charter Member State is materially
10 different than the model Compact statute.
11 a. A Charter Member State whose enactment is found to be
12 materially different from the model Compact statute
13 shall be entitled to the default process set forth in
14 Section 13.
15 b. If any Member State is later found to be in default,
16 or is terminated or withdraws from the Compact, the
17 Commission shall remain in existence and the Compact
18 shall remain in effect even if the number of Member
19 States should be less than seven.
20 2. Member States enacting the Compact subsequent to the seven
21 initial Charter Member States shall be subject to the process set
22 forth in Section 10(C)(21) to determine if their enactments are
23 materially different from the model Compact statute and whether they
24 qualify for participation in the Compact.
Req. No. 10945 Page 46

1 3. All actions taken for the benefit of the Commission or in
2 furtherance of the purposes of the administration of the Compact
3 prior to the effective date of the Compact or the Commission coming
4 into existence shall be considered to be actions of the Commission
5 unless specifically repudiated by the Commission.
6 4. Any State that joins the Compact subsequent to the
7 Commission’s initial adoption of the Rules and bylaws shall be
8 subject to the Rules and bylaws as they exist on the date on which
9 the Compact becomes law in that State. Any Rule that has been
10 previously adopted by the Commission shall have the full force and
11 effect of law on the day the Compact becomes law in that State.
12 B. Any Member State may withdraw from this Compact by enacting
13 a statute repealing the same.
14 1. A Member State’s withdrawal shall not take effect until one
15 hundred eighty (180) days after enactment of the repealing statute.
16 2. Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirement of
17 the withdrawing State’s Licensing Authority to comply with the
18 investigative and Adverse Action reporting requirements of this
19 Compact prior to the effective date of withdrawal.
20 3. Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing from this
21 compact, a State shall immediately provide notice of such withdrawal
22 to all Licensees within that State. Notwithstanding any subsequent
23 statutory enactment to the contrary, such withdrawing State shall
24 continue to recognize all licenses granted pursuant to this compact
Req. No. 10945 Page 47

1 for a minimum of one hundred eighty (180) days after the date of
2 such notice of withdrawal.

4 invalidate or prevent any licensure agreement or other cooperative
5 arrangement between a Member State and a non-Member State that does
6 not conflict with the provisions of this Compact.

8 amendment to this Compact shall become effective and binding upon
9 any Member State until it is enacted into the laws of all Member
10 States.
11 SECTION 15. NEW LAW A new section of law to be codified
12 in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 1295 of Title 59, unless there
13 is created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:
14 A. This Compact and the Commission’s rulemaking authority shall
15 be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes, and the
16 implementation and administration of the Compact. Provisions of the
17 Compact expressly authorizing or requiring the promulgation of Rules
18 shall not be construed to limit the Commission’s rulemaking
19 authority solely for those purposes.
20 B. The provisions of this Compact shall be severable and if any
21 phrase, clause, sentence, or provision of this Compact is held by a
22 court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to the constitution
23 of any Member State, a State seeking participation in the Compact,
24 or of the United States, or the applicability thereof to any
Req. No. 10945 Page 48

1 gove rnment, agency, person, or circumstance is held to be
2 unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, the validity
3 of the remainder of this Compact and the applicability thereof to
4 any other government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be
5 affected thereby.
6 C. Notwithstanding subsection B of this section, the Commission
7 may deny a State’s participation in the Compact or, in accordance
8 with the requirements of Section 13.B, terminate a Member State’s
9 participation in the Compact, if it determines that a constitutional
10 requirement of a Member State is a material departure from the
11 Compact. Otherwise, if this Compact shall be held to be contrary to
12 the constitution of any Member State, the Compact shall remain in
13 full force and effect as to the remaining Member States and in full
14 force and effect as to the Member State affected as to all severable
15 matters.
16 SECTION 16. NEW LAW A new section of law to be codified
17 in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 1296 of Title 59, unless there
18 is created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:

20 Multistate Authorization to Practice shall adhere to the laws and
21 regulations, including laws, regulations, and applicable standards,
