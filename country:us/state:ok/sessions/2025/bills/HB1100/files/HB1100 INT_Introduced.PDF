10 safety, or welfare of the child would be in imminent
11 danger if the child were returned to the home, and
12 b. there exists either an exceptional circumstance to
13 support the continuance of the child in emergency
14 custody or the parties and the guardian ad litem, if

17 subsection, the emergency custody order shall expire unless the
18 hearing on the merits of the petition is held within one hundred

14 and correct; or
15 3. Conduct a nonjury trial to determine whether the state has
16 met its burden of proving by a preponderance of the clear and

9 of this subsection. A review hearing may be held concurrently with

11 2. When the Department of Human Services has documented a
12 compelling reason why a petition to terminate parental rights to a
13 child is not in the best interests of the child that is based upon a
14 consideration that the child is presently not capable of functioning
15 in a family setting, the court shall reevaluate the status of the
16 child every ninety (90) days until there is a final determination
17 that the child cannot be placed in a family setting.

4 proceeding. Except when allowed to intervene, the foster parent,

6 child is not considered a party to the juvenile court proceeding
7 solely because of notice and the right to be heard at the
8 proceeding.
9 C. The court shall receive all evidence helpful in deciding the

1 b. whether there is a need for the continued placement of
2 the child,
3 c. whether the current permanency plan for the child
4 remains the appropriate plan to meet the health,
5 safety, and best interests of the child,
6 d. whether the services set forth in the individualized
7 service plan and the responsibilities of the parties

13 adjudication of the child,

17 reunification or other permanent plan for the child,

23 title, or that continuation of reasonable efforts to
24 reunite the child with the child's family is
Req. No. 10437 Page 38

2 the court shall determine if reasonable efforts are
3 being made to place the child in a timely manner in
4 accordance with the permanency plan and determine the

11 the child regarding any proposed independent living
12 plan,
13 i. whether the nature and extent of services being
14 provided the child and parent or parents of the child
15 are adequate and shall order that additional services
16 be provided or studies, assessments, or evaluations be
17 conducted, if necessary, to ensure the safety of the
18 child and to protect the child from further physical,
19 mental, or emotional harm, or to correct the
20 conditions that led to the adjudication,
21 j. whether, in accordance with the safety or well-being
22 of any child, reasonable efforts have been made to:
23
24
Req. No. 10437 Page 39

17 subsection, the emergency custody order shall expire unless the

14 consideration that the child is presently not capable of functioning
15 in a family setting, the court shall reevaluate the status of the
16 child every ninety (90) days until there is a final determination
17 that the child cannot be placed in a family setting.

4 remains the appropriate plan to meet the health,
5 safety, and best interests of the child,
6 d. whether the services set forth in the individualized

11 the child regarding any proposed independent living
12 plan,
13 i. whether the nature and extent of services being
14 provided the child and parent or parents of the child
15 are adequate and shall order that additional services
16 be provided or studies, assessments, or evaluations be
17 conducted, if necessary, to ensure the safety of the
18 child and to protect the child from further physical,
19 mental, or emotional harm, or to correct the
20 conditions that led to the adjudication,
21 j. whether, in accordance with the safety or well-being
22 of any child, reasonable efforts have been made to:
