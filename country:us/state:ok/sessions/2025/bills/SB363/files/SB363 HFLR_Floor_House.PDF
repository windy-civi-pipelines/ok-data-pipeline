1 1. “Degree-granting institution” means an institution that
2 offers education leading to an associate’s degree or higher;
3 2. “Non-degree-granting activity” means offering education or
4 training that does not lead to an associate’s degree or higher; and
5 3. “Religious degree-granting institution” means an institution
6 that is domiciled within the United States or a United States
7 district or territory; is exempt from taxation pursuant to the

11 content, and name of all degrees offered by the institution meet the

14 criteria set forth in paragraphs 1 and 2 of subsection B of Section
15 4104 of this title, an institution fails to meet the definition of a

18 this section as to those degrees; and
19 4. “State authorization reciprocity agreement” means an
20 agreement among states, districts, and territories that establishes
21 comparable standards for providing distance education from their
22 postsecondary educational institutions to out-of-state students.
