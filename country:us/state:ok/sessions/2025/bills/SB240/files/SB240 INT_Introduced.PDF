Section 39:
Section 18-201.1. A. Beginning with the 2020-21 school year,
13
14
and each school year thereafter, the weighted membership of a school
14
15
district for calculation of Foundation Aid purposes pursuant to
15
16
paragraph 1 of subsection D of Section 18-200.1 of this title shall
16
17
be the sum of the weighted pupil grade level calculation, the
17
18
weighted pupil category calculation, the weighted district
18
19
calculation, and the weighted teacher experience and degree
19
20
calculation. The weighted membership of a school district for

calculations provided for in subsection A of this section shall be
4
5
based on the higher weighted average daily membership (ADM) of the
5
6
first nine (9) weeks of the current school year or the preceding
6
7
school year of a school district, unless otherwise specified. The
7
8
higher of the two (2) weighted average daily memberships shall be
8
9
used consistently in all of the calculations; however, the weighted
9
10
calculation for a statewide virtual charter school experiencing a
10
11
significant decline in membership shall be based on the first nine
11
12
(9) weeks of the current school year for the statewide virtual
12
13
charter school. For purposes of this subsection, “significant
13
14
decline in membership” means equal to or greater than a fifteen
14
15
percent (15%) decrease in average daily membership from the
15
16
preceding school year to the average daily membership of the first
16
17
nine (9) weeks of the current school year. The average daily
17

12
13
Section 18-201.1. A. Beginning with the 2020-21 school year,
13
14
and each school year thereafter, the weighted membership of a school
14
15
district for calculation of Foundation Aid purposes pursuant to
15
16
paragraph 1 of subsection D of Section 18-200.1 of this title shall
16
17
be the sum of the weighted pupil grade level calculation, the

calculations provided for in subsection A of this section shall be
4
5
based on the higher weighted average daily membership (ADM) of the
5
6
first nine (9) weeks of the current school year or the preceding
6
7
school year of a school district, unless otherwise specified. The
7
8
higher of the two (2) weighted average daily memberships shall be
8
9
used consistently in all of the calculations; however, the weighted
9
10
calculation for a statewide virtual charter school experiencing a
10
11
significant decline in membership shall be based on the first nine
11
12
(9) weeks of the current school year for the statewide virtual
12
13
charter school. For purposes of this subsection, “significant
13
14
decline in membership” means equal to or greater than a fifteen
14
15
percent (15%) decrease in average daily membership from the
15
16
preceding school year to the average daily membership of the first
16

1
2
determining the calculations for each school district for both the
2
3
small school district formula and the district sparsity - isolation
3
4
formula, applying whichever is the greater of the calculations of
4
5
the two formulas and then applying the restrictions pursuant to
5
6
subparagraph c of this paragraph.
6
7
a. Small school district formula: 750 minus the average
7
8
daily membership divided by 750 times .2 times total
8
9
average daily membership.
9
10
The small school district formula calculation shall apply
10
11
only to school districts whose highest average daily
11
12
membership is less than 750 pupils. School districts which
12
13
are consolidated or annexed after July 1, 2003, pursuant to
13
14
the Oklahoma School Voluntary Consolidation and Annexation
14
15
Act shall have the weighted district size calculation for
15
16
the three (3) school years following the fiscal year in
16
17
which such consolidation occurred calculated to be the sum
17
18
of the individual consolidated districts computed as if the
18
19
consolidation had not taken place. Thereafter, any such
19
20
district which is consolidated pursuant to the Oklahoma
20
21
School Voluntary Consolidation and Annexation Act shall not
21
22
qualify for the weighted district calculation unless the
22
23
district can satisfy the specifications herein. Subject to
23
24
the provisions of subparagraph c of this paragraph, the
24
Req. No. 261 Page 24

1
resulting number shall be counted as additional students
1
2
for the purpose of calculating State Aid.
2
3
b. District sparsity - isolation formula:
3
4
The district sparsity - isolation formula calculation shall
4
5
apply only to school districts:
5
6
(1) whose total area in square miles is greater than
6
7
the average number of square miles for all school
7
8
districts in this state;, and
8
9
(2) whose areal density is less than one-fourth (1/4)
9
10
of the state average areal density. Areal
10
11
density shall be determined by dividing the
11
12
school district’s average daily membership by the
12
13
school district’s total area in square miles.
13
14
The district sparsity - isolation formula calculation shall
14
15
be calculated as follows:
15
16
The school district student cost factor multiplied by
16
17
the school district area factor. The resulting
17
18
product shall be multiplied by the school district’s
18
19
average daily membership. Subject to the provisions
19
20
of subparagraph c of this paragraph, the resulting
20
21
number shall be counted as additional students for the
21
22
purpose of calculating State Aid.
22
23
The school district student cost factor shall be calculated
23
24
as follows:
24
Req. No. 261 Page 25

1
The school district’s average daily membership shall
1
2
be categorized into the following grade level groups
2
3
and applied to the appropriate formulas as computed
3
4
below:
4
5
Grade Level Group
5
6
Grades K-5 Divide 74 by the sum of the Grade
6
7
Level ADM plus 23,
7
8
add .85 to the quotient, then
8
9
multiply the sum by the Grade
9
10
Level ADM.
10
11
Grades 6-8 Divide 122 by the sum of the Grade
11
12
Level ADM plus 133,
12
13
add .85 to the quotient, then
13
14
multiply the sum by the Grade
14
15
Level ADM.
15
16
Grades 9-12 Divide 292 by the sum of the Grade
16
17
Level ADM plus 128,
17
18
add .78 to the quotient, then
18
19
multiply the sum by the Grade
19
20
Level ADM.
20
21
The sum of the grade level group’s average daily
21
22
membership shall be divided by the school district’s
22
23
average daily membership. The number one (1.0) shall
23
24
be subtracted from the resulting quotient.
24
Req. No. 261 Page 26

1
The school district area cost factor shall be calculated as
1
2
follows:
2
3
Subtract the state average district area from the
3
4
district area, then divide the remainder by the state
4
5
average district area;
5
6
however, the district area cost factor shall not exceed one
6
7
(1.0).
7
8
The State Board of Education shall define geographical barriers
8
9
whose location in a school district would inhibit the district from
9
10
consolidation or annexation. The Board shall make available an
10
11
application process, review applications, and for districts the
11
12
Board deems necessary allow additional square miles to be used for
12
13
the purposes of calculations used for the weighted district sparsity
13
14
- isolation formula. Provided, that the additional square miles
14
15
allowed for geographical barriers shall not exceed thirty percent
15
16
(30%) of the district’s actual size.
16
17
c. State Aid funds which a district is calculated to
17
18
receive as a result of the weighted district
18
19
calculation shall be restricted as follows:
19
20
If, after the weighted district calculation is
20
21
applied, the district’s projected per pupil
21
22
revenue exceeds one hundred fifty percent (150%)
22
23
of the projected state average per pupil revenue,
23
24
then the district’s State Aid shall be reduced by
24
Req. No. 261 Page 27

1
an amount that will restrict the district’s
1
2
projected per pupil revenue to one hundred fifty
2
3
percent (150%) of the projected state average per
3
4
pupil revenue. Provided, in applying the
4
5
restriction provided in this division, the
5
6
district’s State Aid shall not be reduced by an
6
7
amount greater than by the amount of State Aid
7
8
which was generated by the weighted district
8
9
calculation.
9
10
The July calculation of the projected per pupil
10
11
revenue shall be determined by dividing the district’s
11
12
preceding year’s average daily membership (ADM) as
12
13
weighted by the pupil grade level, the pupil category,
13
14
the district and the teacher experience degree index
14
15
calculations for projected State Aid into the
15
16
district’s projected total revenues including
16
17
projected funds for the State Aid Formula for the
17
18
preceding year, net assessed valuation the amount
18
19
received by the school district from ad valorem tax
19
20
collections for the preceding calendar year times
20
21
thirty-nine (39) mills, county revenues excluding the
21
22
county four-mills revenues for the second preceding
22

3
The December calculation of the projected per pupil
3
4
revenue shall be determined by dividing the higher of
4
5
the district’s first nine (9) weeks of the current
5
6
school year or the preceding school year’s average
6
7
daily membership (ADM) as weighted by the pupil grade
7
8
level, the pupil category, the district and the
8
9
teacher experience degree index calculations for
9
10
projected State Aid into the district’s projected
10
11
total revenues including funds for the December
11
12
calculation of the current year State Aid Formula, net
12
13
assessed valuation the amount received by the school
13
14
district from ad valorem tax collections for the
14
