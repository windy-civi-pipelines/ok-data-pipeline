10 SECTION 3. AMENDATORY 70 O.S. 2021, Section 18-201.1, as
11 amended by Section 2, Chapter 280, O.S.L. 2023 (70 O.S. Supp. 2024,
12 Section 18-201.1), is amended to read as follows:
13 Section 18-201.1. A. Beginning with the 2020-21 school year,
14 and each school year thereafter, the weighted membership of a school
15 district for calculation of Foundation Aid purposes pursuant to
16 paragraph 1 of subsection D of Section 18-200.1 of this title shall
17 be the sum of the weighted pupil grade level calculation, the
18 weighted pupil category calculation, the weighted district
19 calculation, and the weighted teacher experience and degree
20 calculation. The weighted membership of a school district for
21 calculation of Salary Incentive Aid purposes pursuant to paragraph 3

23 of the weighted pupil grade level calculation, the weighted pupil
24
SENATE FLOOR VERSION - SB240 SFLR Page 19
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)
1 cate gory calculation, the weighted district calculation, and the
2 weighted teacher experience and degree calculation.
3 B. Beginning with the 2022-2023 school year, the weighted
4 calculations provided for in subsection A of this section shall be
5 based on the higher weighted average daily membership (ADM) of the
6 first nine (9) weeks of the current school year or the preceding
7 school year of a school district, unless otherwise specified. The
8 higher of the two (2) weighted average daily memberships shall be
9 used consistently in all of the calculations; however, the weighted
10 calculation for a statewide virtual charter school experiencing a
11 significant decline in membership shall be based on the first nine
12 (9) weeks of the current school year for the statewide virtual
13 charter school. For purposes of this subsection, “significant
14 decline in membership” means equal to or greater than a fifteen
15 percent (15%) decrease in average daily membership from the
16 preceding school year to the average daily membership of the first
17 nine (9) weeks of the current school year. The average daily
18 membership data used for all calculations in paragraphs 1, 2, 3, and
19 4 of this subsection shall be the same as used in the calculation of
20 the State Aid Formula. The weighted calculations provided for in
21 subsection A of this section shall be determined as follows:
22 1. The weighted pupil grade level calculation shall be
23 determined by taking the highest average daily membership and

12 i. Out-of-home placement 1.50
13 Multiply the membership of each subparagraph of this paragraph by
14 the weight assigned to such subparagraph of this paragraph and add
15 the totals together to determine the weighted pupil grade level
16 calculation for a school district. Determination of the pupils
17 eligible for the early childhood program weight shall be pursuant to
18 the provisions of Section 1-114 of this title. The pupils eligible
19 for the out-of-home placement pupil weight shall be students who are
20 not residents of the school district in which they are receiving
21 education pursuant to the provisions of subsection D of Section 1-
22 113 of this title. Such weight may be claimed by the district
23 providing educational services to such student for the days that
24 student is enrolled in that district. If claimed, the out-of-home
SENATE FLOOR VERSION - SB240 SFLR Page 21
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)
1 plac ement weight shall be in lieu of the pupil grade level and any
2 pupil category weights for that student. Provided, if a student
3 resides in a juvenile detention center that is restricted to less
4 than twelve (12) beds, the out-of-home placement pupil weight for
5 such students shall be calculated as follows: for a center with six
6 (6) beds - 3.0; for a center with eight (8) beds - 2.3; and for a
7 center with ten (10) beds - 1.80.
8 2. The weighted pupil category calculation shall be determined
9 by assigning a weight to the pupil category as follows:
10 CATEGORY WEIGHT
11 a. Visual Impairment 3.8
12 b. Specific Learning Disability .4
13 c. Deafness or Hearing Impairment 2.9

8 Except as otherwise provided, multiply the number of pupils approved
9 in the school year with the highest average daily membership in each
10 category by the weight assigned to such category and add the totals
11 together to determine the weighted pupil category calculation for a
12 school district. For the 1997-98 school year and subsequent school
13 years, the number to be multiplied by the weight assigned to the
14 gifted category in subparagraph g of this paragraph shall be the
15 lesser of (1) the sum of the number of students who scored in the
16 top three percent (3%) on any national standardized test of
17 intellectual ability plus the number of students identified as
18 gifted pursuant to subparagraphs a through d of paragraph 1 of
19 Section 1210.301 of this title, or (2) the sum of the number of
20 students who scored in the top three percent (3%) on any national
21 standardized test of intellectual ability plus eight percent (8%) of
22 the total average daily membership of the school district for the
23 first nine (9) weeks of the school year.
24
SENATE FLOOR VERSION - SB240 SFLR Page 23

1 3. The weighted district calculation shall be determined by
2 determining the calculations for each school district for both the
3 small school district formula and the district sparsity - isolation
4 formula, applying whichever is the greater of the calculations of
5 the two formulas and then applying the restrictions pursuant to
6 subparagraph c of this paragraph.
7 a. Small school district formula: 750 minus the average
8 daily membership divided by 750 times .2 times total
9 average daily membership.
10 The small school district formula calculation shall apply
11 only to school districts whose highest average daily
12 membership is less than 750 pupils. School districts which
13 are consolidated or annexed after July 1, 2003, pursuant to
14 the Oklahoma School Voluntary Consolidation and Annexation
15 Act shall have the weighted district size calculation for
16 the three (3) school years following the fiscal year in
17 which such consolidation occurred calculated to be the sum
18 of the individual consolidated districts computed as if the
19 consolidation had not taken place. Thereafter, any such
20 district which is consolidated pursuant to the Oklahoma
21 School Voluntary Consolidation and Annexation Act shall not
22 qualify for the weighted district calculation unless the
23 district can satisfy the specifications herein. Subject to
24 the provisions of subparagraph c of this paragraph, the
SENATE FLOOR VERSION - SB240 SFLR Page 24
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)
1 resulting number shall be counted as additional students
2 for the purpose of calculating State Aid.
3 b. District sparsity - isolation formula:
4 The district sparsity - isolation formula calculation shall
5 apply only to school districts:
6 (1) whose total area in square miles is greater than
7 the average number of square miles for all school
8 districts in this state;, and
9 (2) whose areal density is less than one-fourth (1/4)
10 of the state average areal density. Areal
11 density shall be determined by dividing the
12 school district’s average daily membership by the
13 school district’s total area in square miles.
14 The district sparsity - isolation formula calculation shall
15 be calculated as follows:
16 The school district student cost factor multiplied by
17 the school district area factor. The resulting
18 product shall be multiplied by the school district’s
19 average daily membership. Subject to the provisions
20 of subparagraph c of this paragraph, the resulting
21 number shall be counted as additional students for the
22 purpose of calculating State Aid.
23 The school district student cost factor shall be calculated
24 as follows:
SENATE FLOOR VERSION - SB240 SFLR Page 25
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)
1 The school district’s average daily membership shall
2 be categorized into the following grade level groups
3 and applied to the appropriate formulas as computed
4 below:
5 Grade Level Group
6 Grades K-5 Divide 74 by the sum of the Grade
7 Level ADM plus 23,
8 add .85 to the quotient, then
9 multiply the sum by the Grade
10 Level ADM.
11 Grades 6-8 Divide 122 by the sum of the Grade
12 Level ADM plus 133,
13 add .85 to the quotient, then
14 multiply the sum by the Grade
15 Level ADM.
16 Grades 9-12 Divide 292 by the sum of the Grade
17 Level ADM plus 128,
18 add .78 to the quotient, then
19 multiply the sum by the Grade
20 Level ADM.
21 The sum of the grade level group’s average daily
22 membership shall be divided by the school district’s
23 average daily membership. The number one (1.0) shall
24 be subtracted from the resulting quotient.
SENATE FLOOR VERSION - SB240 SFLR Page 26
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)
1 The school district area cost factor shall be calculated as
2 follows:
3 Subtract the state average district area from the
4 district area, then divide the remainder by the state
5 average district area;
6 however, the district area cost factor shall not exceed one
7 (1.0).
8 The State Board of Education shall define geographical barriers
9 whose location in a school district would inhibit the district from
10 consolidation or annexation. The Board shall make available an
11 application process, review applications, and for districts the
12 Board deems necessary allow additional square miles to be used for
13 the purposes of calculations used for the weighted district sparsity
14 - isolation formula. Provided, that the additional square miles
15 allowed for geographical barriers shall not exceed thirty percent
16 (30%) of the district’s actual size.
17 c. State Aid funds which a district is calculated to
18 receive as a result of the weighted district
19 calculation shall be restricted as follows:
20 If, after the weighted district calculation is
21 applied, the district’s projected per pupil
22 revenue exceeds one hundred fifty percent (150%)
23 of the projected state average per pupil revenue,
24 then the district’s State Aid shall be reduced by
SENATE FLOOR VERSION - SB240 SFLR Page 27
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)
1 an amount that will restrict the district’s
2 projected per pupil revenue to one hundred fifty
3 percent (150%) of the projected state average per
4 pupil revenue. Provided, in applying the
5 restriction provided in this division, the
6 district’s State Aid shall not be reduced by an
7 amount greater than by the amount of State Aid
8 which was generated by the weighted district
9 calculation.
10 The July calculation of the projected per pupil
11 revenue shall be determined by dividing the district’s
12 preceding year’s average daily membership (ADM) as
13 weighted by the pupil grade level, the pupil category,
14 the district and the teacher experience degree index
15 calculations for projected State Aid into the
16 district’s projected total revenues including
17 projected funds for the State Aid Formula for the
18 preceding year, net assessed valuation the amount
19 received by the school district from ad valorem tax
20 collections for the preceding calendar year times
21 thirty-nine (39) mills, county revenues excluding the
22 county four-mills revenues for the second preceding
23 year, other state appropriations for the preceding
24 year, and the collections for the preceding year of
SENATE FLOOR VERSION - SB240 SFLR Page 28
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)
1 state apportionment, motor vehicle revenue, gross
2 production tax, and R.E.A. tax.
3 The December calculation of the projected per pupil
4 revenue shall be determined by dividing the higher of
5 the district’s first nine (9) weeks of the current
6 school year or the preceding school year’s average
7 daily membership (ADM) as weighted by the pupil grade
8 level, the pupil category, the district and the
9 teacher experience degree index calculations for
10 projected State Aid into the district’s projected
11 total revenues including funds for the December
12 calculation of the current year State Aid Formula, net
13 assessed valuation the amount received by the school
14 district from ad valorem tax collections for the
15 current calendar preceding fiscal year times thirty-
16 nine (39) mills, county revenues excluding the county
17 four-mills revenue for the preceding year, other state
18 appropriations for the preceding year, and the
19 collections for the preceding year of state
20 apportionment, motor vehicle revenue, gross production
21 tax, and R.E.A. tax.
22 The district’s projected total revenues for each
23 calculation shall exclude the following collections
24 for the second preceding year: federal revenue,
SENATE FLOOR VERSION - SB240 SFLR Page 29
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)
1 insurance loss payments, reimbursements, recovery of
2 overpayments and refunds, unused reserves, prior
3 expenditures recovered, prior year surpluses, and
4 other local miscellaneous revenues.
5 4. The weighted teacher experience and degree calculation shall
6 be determined in accordance with the teacher experience and degree
7 index. The State Department of Education shall determine an index
8 for each state teacher by using data supplied in the school
9 district’s teacher personnel reports of the preceding year and
10 utilizing the index as follows:
11 TEACHER EXPERIENCE - DEGREE INDEX
12 EXPERIENCE BACHELOR’S MASTER’S DOCTOR’S
13 DEGREE DEGREE DEGREE
14 0 - 2 .7 .9 1.1
15 3 - 5 .8 1.0 1.2
16 6 - 8 .9 1.1 1.3
17 9 - 11 1.0 1.2 1.4
18 12 - 15 1.1 1.3 1.5
19 Over 15 1.2 1.4 1.6
20 The school district teacher index for each school district shall
21 be determined by subtracting the weighted average state teacher from
22 the weighted average district teacher. Multiply the school district
23 teacher index if greater than zero by .7 and then multiply that
24 product by the sum of the district’s weighted pupil grade level

4 Section 18-200.1. A. Beginning with the 2022-2023 2026-2027
5 school year, and each school year thereafter, each school district
6 shall have its initial allocation of State Aid calculated based on
7 the ad valorem tax and state dedicated revenues actually collected
8 during the preceding fiscal year, the adjusted assessed valuation of
9 the preceding year, and the weighted average daily membership (ADM)
10 for the school district of the preceding school year. Each school
11 district shall submit the following data based on the first nine (9)
12 weeks, to be used in the calculation of the average daily membership
13 of the school district:
14 1. Student enrollment by grade level;
15 2. Pupil category counts; and
16 3. Transportation supplement data.
17 On or before December 30, the State Department of Education
18 shall determine each school district’s current year allocation
19 pursuant to subsection D of this section. The State Department of
20 Education shall complete an audit, using procedures established by

10 B. The State Department of Education shall retain not less than
11 one and one-half percent (1 1/2%) four percent (4%) of the total
12 funds appropriated for financial support of schools, to be used to
13 make midyear adjustments in State Aid and which shall be reflected
14 in the final allocations. If the amount of appropriated funds,
15 including the one and one-half percent (1 1/2%) four percent (4%)
16 retained, remaining after January 1 of each year is not sufficient
17 to fully fund the final allocations, the Department shall
18 recalculate each school district’s remaining allocation pursuant to
19 subsection D of this section using the reduced amount of
20 appropriated funds.
21 C. On and after July 1, 1997, the amount of State Aid each

13 Section 18-201.1. A. Beginning with the 2020-21 school year,
14 and each school year thereafter, the weighted membership of a school
15 district for calculation of Foundation Aid purposes pursuant to
16 paragraph 1 of subsection D of Section 18-200.1 of this title shall
17 be the sum of the weighted pupil grade level calculation, the
18 weighted pupil category calculation, the weighted district

1 cate gory calculation, the weighted district calculation, and the
2 weighted teacher experience and degree calculation.
3 B. Beginning with the 2022-2023 school year, the weighted
4 calculations provided for in subsection A of this section shall be
5 based on the higher weighted average daily membership (ADM) of the
6 first nine (9) weeks of the current school year or the preceding
7 school year of a school district, unless otherwise specified. The
8 higher of the two (2) weighted average daily memberships shall be
9 used consistently in all of the calculations; however, the weighted
10 calculation for a statewide virtual charter school experiencing a
11 significant decline in membership shall be based on the first nine
12 (9) weeks of the current school year for the statewide virtual
13 charter school. For purposes of this subsection, “significant
14 decline in membership” means equal to or greater than a fifteen
15 percent (15%) decrease in average daily membership from the
16 preceding school year to the average daily membership of the first
17 nine (9) weeks of the current school year. The average daily
18 membership data used for all calculations in paragraphs 1, 2, 3, and
19 4 of this subsection shall be the same as used in the calculation of
20 the State Aid Formula. The weighted calculations provided for in
21 subsection A of this section shall be determined as follows:
22 1. The weighted pupil grade level calculation shall be
23 determined by taking the highest average daily membership and

13 Multiply the membership of each subparagraph of this paragraph by
14 the weight assigned to such subparagraph of this paragraph and add
15 the totals together to determine the weighted pupil grade level
16 calculation for a school district. Determination of the pupils
17 eligible for the early childhood program weight shall be pursuant to
18 the provisions of Section 1-114 of this title. The pupils eligible
19 for the out-of-home placement pupil weight shall be students who are
20 not residents of the school district in which they are receiving
21 education pursuant to the provisions of subsection D of Section 1-
22 113 of this title. Such weight may be claimed by the district
23 providing educational services to such student for the days that
24 student is enrolled in that district. If claimed, the out-of-home

11 together to determine the weighted pupil category calculation for a
12 school district. For the 1997-98 school year and subsequent school
13 years, the number to be multiplied by the weight assigned to the
14 gifted category in subparagraph g of this paragraph shall be the
15 lesser of (1) the sum of the number of students who scored in the
16 top three percent (3%) on any national standardized test of
17 intellectual ability plus the number of students identified as
18 gifted pursuant to subparagraphs a through d of paragraph 1 of

1 3. The weighted district calculation shall be determined by
2 determining the calculations for each school district for both the
3 small school district formula and the district sparsity - isolation
4 formula, applying whichever is the greater of the calculations of
5 the two formulas and then applying the restrictions pursuant to
6 subparagraph c of this paragraph.
7 a. Small school district formula: 750 minus the average
8 daily membership divided by 750 times .2 times total
9 average daily membership.
10 The small school district formula calculation shall apply
11 only to school districts whose highest average daily
12 membership is less than 750 pupils. School districts which
13 are consolidated or annexed after July 1, 2003, pursuant to
14 the Oklahoma School Voluntary Consolidation and Annexation
15 Act shall have the weighted district size calculation for
16 the three (3) school years following the fiscal year in
17 which such consolidation occurred calculated to be the sum
18 of the individual consolidated districts computed as if the
19 consolidation had not taken place. Thereafter, any such
20 district which is consolidated pursuant to the Oklahoma
21 School Voluntary Consolidation and Annexation Act shall not
22 qualify for the weighted district calculation unless the
23 district can satisfy the specifications herein. Subject to
24 the provisions of subparagraph c of this paragraph, the
SENATE FLOOR VERSION - SB240 SFLR Page 24
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)

1 resulting number shall be counted as additional students
2 for the purpose of calculating State Aid.
3 b. District sparsity - isolation formula:
4 The district sparsity - isolation formula calculation shall
5 apply only to school districts:
6 (1) whose total area in square miles is greater than
7 the average number of square miles for all school
8 districts in this state;, and
9 (2) whose areal density is less than one-fourth (1/4)
10 of the state average areal density. Areal
11 density shall be determined by dividing the
12 school district’s average daily membership by the
13 school district’s total area in square miles.
14 The district sparsity - isolation formula calculation shall
15 be calculated as follows:
16 The school district student cost factor multiplied by
17 the school district area factor. The resulting
18 product shall be multiplied by the school district’s
19 average daily membership. Subject to the provisions
20 of subparagraph c of this paragraph, the resulting
21 number shall be counted as additional students for the
22 purpose of calculating State Aid.
23 The school district student cost factor shall be calculated
24 as follows:
SENATE FLOOR VERSION - SB240 SFLR Page 25
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)

1 The school district’s average daily membership shall
2 be categorized into the following grade level groups
3 and applied to the appropriate formulas as computed
4 below:
5 Grade Level Group
6 Grades K-5 Divide 74 by the sum of the Grade
7 Level ADM plus 23,
8 add .85 to the quotient, then
9 multiply the sum by the Grade
10 Level ADM.
11 Grades 6-8 Divide 122 by the sum of the Grade
12 Level ADM plus 133,
13 add .85 to the quotient, then
14 multiply the sum by the Grade
15 Level ADM.
16 Grades 9-12 Divide 292 by the sum of the Grade
17 Level ADM plus 128,
18 add .78 to the quotient, then
19 multiply the sum by the Grade
20 Level ADM.
21 The sum of the grade level group’s average daily
22 membership shall be divided by the school district’s
23 average daily membership. The number one (1.0) shall
24 be subtracted from the resulting quotient.
SENATE FLOOR VERSION - SB240 SFLR Page 26
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)

1 The school district area cost factor shall be calculated as
2 follows:
3 Subtract the state average district area from the
4 district area, then divide the remainder by the state
5 average district area;
6 however, the district area cost factor shall not exceed one
7 (1.0).
8 The State Board of Education shall define geographical barriers
9 whose location in a school district would inhibit the district from
10 consolidation or annexation. The Board shall make available an
11 application process, review applications, and for districts the
12 Board deems necessary allow additional square miles to be used for
13 the purposes of calculations used for the weighted district sparsity
14 - isolation formula. Provided, that the additional square miles
15 allowed for geographical barriers shall not exceed thirty percent
16 (30%) of the district’s actual size.
17 c. State Aid funds which a district is calculated to
18 receive as a result of the weighted district
19 calculation shall be restricted as follows:
20 If, after the weighted district calculation is
21 applied, the district’s projected per pupil
22 revenue exceeds one hundred fifty percent (150%)
23 of the projected state average per pupil revenue,
24 then the district’s State Aid shall be reduced by
SENATE FLOOR VERSION - SB240 SFLR Page 27
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)

1 an amount that will restrict the district’s
2 projected per pupil revenue to one hundred fifty
3 percent (150%) of the projected state average per
4 pupil revenue. Provided, in applying the
5 restriction provided in this division, the
6 district’s State Aid shall not be reduced by an
7 amount greater than by the amount of State Aid
8 which was generated by the weighted district
9 calculation.
10 The July calculation of the projected per pupil
11 revenue shall be determined by dividing the district’s
12 preceding year’s average daily membership (ADM) as
13 weighted by the pupil grade level, the pupil category,
14 the district and the teacher experience degree index
15 calculations for projected State Aid into the
16 district’s projected total revenues including
17 projected funds for the State Aid Formula for the
18 preceding year, net assessed valuation the amount
19 received by the school district from ad valorem tax
20 collections for the preceding calendar year times
21 thirty-nine (39) mills, county revenues excluding the
22 county four-mills revenues for the second preceding
23 year, other state appropriations for the preceding
24 year, and the collections for the preceding year of
SENATE FLOOR VERSION - SB240 SFLR Page 28
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)

1 state apportionment, motor vehicle revenue, gross
2 production tax, and R.E.A. tax.
3 The December calculation of the projected per pupil
4 revenue shall be determined by dividing the higher of
5 the district’s first nine (9) weeks of the current
6 school year or the preceding school year’s average
7 daily membership (ADM) as weighted by the pupil grade
8 level, the pupil category, the district and the
9 teacher experience degree index calculations for
10 projected State Aid into the district’s projected
11 total revenues including funds for the December
12 calculation of the current year State Aid Formula, net
13 assessed valuation the amount received by the school
14 district from ad valorem tax collections for the
15 current calendar preceding fiscal year times thirty-
16 nine (39) mills, county revenues excluding the county
17 four-mills revenue for the preceding year, other state
18 appropriations for the preceding year, and the
19 collections for the preceding year of state
20 apportionment, motor vehicle revenue, gross production
21 tax, and R.E.A. tax.
22 The district’s projected total revenues for each
23 calculation shall exclude the following collections
24 for the second preceding year: federal revenue,
SENATE FLOOR VERSION - SB240 SFLR Page 29
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)

1 insurance loss payments, reimbursements, recovery of
2 overpayments and refunds, unused reserves, prior
3 expenditures recovered, prior year surpluses, and
4 other local miscellaneous revenues.
5 4. The weighted teacher experience and degree calculation shall
6 be determined in accordance with the teacher experience and degree
7 index. The State Department of Education shall determine an index
8 for each state teacher by using data supplied in the school
9 district’s teacher personnel reports of the preceding year and
10 utilizing the index as follows:
11 TEACHER EXPERIENCE - DEGREE INDEX
12 EXPERIENCE BACHELOR’S MASTER’S DOCTOR’S
13 DEGREE DEGREE DEGREE
14 0 - 2 .7 .9 1.1
15 3 - 5 .8 1.0 1.2
16 6 - 8 .9 1.1 1.3
17 9 - 11 1.0 1.2 1.4
18 12 - 15 1.1 1.3 1.5
19 Over 15 1.2 1.4 1.6
20 The school district teacher index for each school district shall
21 be determined by subtracting the weighted average state teacher from
22 the weighted average district teacher. Multiply the school district
23 teacher index if greater than zero by .7 and then multiply that
24 product by the sum of the district’s weighted pupil grade level
