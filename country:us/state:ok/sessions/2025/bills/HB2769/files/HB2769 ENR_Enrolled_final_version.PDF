and

punishment authorized in subsection E of this section.
Admonitions or reprimands given as nonjudicial punishment to
commissioned officers and warrant officers shall be administered in
writing. In all other cases, unless otherwise prescribed by
regulations promulgated by the Adjutant General, such punishments
may be administered either orally or in writing.
G. Whenever any punishments are combined to run consecutively,
the total length of the combined punishment shall not exceed the
authorized duration of the longest punishment included in the
combination, and there shall be an apportionment of punishments so
ENR. H. B. NO. 2769 Page 10
that no single punishment in the combination exceeds its authorized
length under this section.
H. Once the commander commanding officer has determined that
nonjudicial punishment is appropriate, the commander commanding
officer shall provide reasonable notice to the member of his or her
intent to impose nonjudicial punishment. At the time the commander
commanding officer provides notification as required in this
subsection, the member shall be entitled to examine all statements
and other evidence that the commander has examined and intends to
rely upon as the basis for punishment. The member shall be provided
a copy of the documentary evidence unless it is privileged,
classified, or otherwise restricted by law, regulation, or
instruction. At the time the commander commanding officer provides
notification as required in this subsection, the commander
commanding officer shall also inform the member as to the quantum of
punishment potentially to be imposed. While a member undergoing
nonjudicial punishment is not entitled to representation by a duly
appointed defense counsel, the member may seek legal advice from any
judge advocate available for this purpose. Upon notification by the
officer of his or her intent to impose judicial punishment, the
member shall provide a response within forty-five (45) calendar
days.
I. The right to demand trial by court-martial in lieu of
nonjudicial punishment shall arise only when arrest in quarters or
restriction will be considered as punishments. If the commanding
officer determines that arrest in quarters or restriction will be
considered as punishments, prior to the offer of nonjudicial
punishment the accused member shall be notified in writing of the
right to demand trial by court-martial. Should the commanding
officer determine that the punishment options will not include
arrest in quarters or restriction, the accused member shall be
notified that there is no right to trial by court-martial in lieu of
nonjudicial punishment. Upon notification by the commander or
officer in charge commanding officer of his or her intent to impose
nonjudicial punishment that includes arrest in quarters or
restriction, the accused member shall be afforded a reasonable
amount of time to confer with legal counsel and to prepare a
response.
J. The commanding officer who imposes the punishment, or his or
her successor in command, may at any time suspend, set aside,
mitigate or remit any part or amount of the punishment and restore
ENR. H. B. NO. 2769 Page 11
all rights, privileges and property affected. The commanding
officer may also mitigate:

Section 46:
1. Reduction in grade to forfeiture of pay;

Section 47:
2. Arrest in quarters to restriction; or

Section 48:
3. Extra duties to restriction.
The mitigated punishment shall not be for a greater period than
the punishment mitigated. When mitigating reduction in grade to
forfeiture of pay, the amount of the forfeiture shall not be greater
than the amount that could have been imposed initially under this
article by the officer who imposed the punishment mitigated.
K. A person punished under this section who considers the
punishment unjust or disproportionate to the offense may, through
his or her chain of command, appeal to a senior officer designated
by the Adjutant General to adjudicate appeals arising from
nonjudicial punishment. A senior officer so designated by the
Adjutant General shall be a member of the same component of the
state military forces as the accused. An appeal made pursuant to
this subsection shall be lodged within fifteen (15) days after the
punishment is announced to the accused member. The commanding
officer exercising appellate authority may, at his or her
discretion, extend the deadline for an appeal. The appeal shall be
promptly forwarded and decided, and the member shall not be punished
until the appeal is decided. The senior officer designated by the
Adjutant General as exercising appellate authority may exercise the
same powers with respect to the punishment imposed as may be
exercised under subsection I of this section by the officer who
imposed the punishment. Before acting on an appeal from a
punishment, the senior officer exercising appellate authority shall
refer the case to a judge advocate for consideration and advice.
When a senior officer is designated by the Adjutant General to
adjudicate appeals arising from nonjudicial punishment, such
designation shall be accomplished in writing and shall be considered
a military publication, as defined in Section 801 of this title
(Article 1).
L. Except for nonjudicial punishment imposed by the Governor or
the Adjutant General, the final appellate authority for nonjudicial
punishment imposed within state military forces is the Adjutant
General. A person punished under this section whose appeal was
previously denied by a senior officer designated to adjudicate
ENR. H. B. NO. 2769 Page 12
appeals may, through his or her chain of command, lodge an
additional appeal with the Adjutant General within five (5) days
after the appeal is denied. In the event the officer imposing
nonjudicial punishment is a senior officer who is also designated to
adjudicate appeals arising from nonjudicial punishment, an appeal
thereof shall be addressed directly to the Adjutant General. In the
event the officer imposing nonjudicial punishment is the Adjutant
General, an appeal thereof shall be addressed directly to the
Governor. An appeal offered pursuant to this subsection shall be
made only in writing. Neither the Governor nor the Adjutant General
shall delegate his or her duties as an appellate authority under
this subsection.
M. Whenever nonjudicial punishment is imposed under this

Section 49:
section:

Section 50:
1. After adjudication and while the punishment is being carried
out or while the adjudged punishment is pending before the appellate
authority, the commander or officer in charge who imposed the
nonjudicial punishment, upon the request of the accused member, may:
a. excuse the accused member from attendance at scheduled
unit training assemblies, or
b. arrange for the accused member to drill on alternate
dates and in alternate locations; or

Section 51:
2. If necessary to maintain good order and discipline within
the unit, the commander or officer in charge commanding officer who
imposed the nonjudicial punishment may order the accused member to
drill on alternate dates and in alternate locations. The order
shall be reduced to writing and shall become part of the record of
nonjudicial punishment.
N. The imposition and enforcement of disciplinary punishment
under this section for any act or omission shall not be a bar to
trial by court-martial or a civilian court of competent jurisdiction
for a crime or offense arising out of the same act or omission; but
the fact that a disciplinary punishment has been enforced may be
demonstrated by the accused member upon trial and, when so
demonstrated, it shall be considered in determining the measure of
punishment to be adjudged in the event of a finding or verdict of
guilty. Nonjudicial punishment shall not be imposed for an offense
previously tried by a civilian court unless so authorized by
regulations promulgated by the Adjutant General.
ENR. H. B. NO. 2769 Page 13
O. When nonjudicial punishment has been imposed for an offense,
punishment shall not again be imposed for the same offense under
this section. Once nonjudicial punishment has been imposed, it may
not be increased, upon appeal or otherwise. When a commander or
officer in charge commanding officer determines that nonjudicial
punishment is appropriate for a particular member, all known
offenses determined to be appropriate for disposition by nonjudicial
punishment and ready to be considered at that time, including all
offenses arising from a single incident or course of conduct, shall
be considered together and shall not be made the basis for multiple
punishments. This subsection shall in no way restrict the right of
a commander commanding officer to prefer court-martial charges for
an offense previously punished under the provisions of this section.
P. In accordance with subsection B of Section 843 of this title
(Article 43, subsection B), a person accused of an offense is not
liable to be punished under this section if the offense was
committed more than two (2) years before the imposition of
punishment. Periods in which the accused member is absent without
authority shall be excluded in computing the period of limitation
prescribed in this section.
Q. Whenever a punishment of forfeiture of pay is imposed under
this section, the forfeiture shall not apply to pay accruing before
the date that punishment is imposed, but only pay accruing on or
after the date that punishment is imposed.
R. The Adjutant General may promulgate regulations prescribing
the type and form of records to be kept of proceedings conducted
pursuant to this section. The Adjutant General may promulgate any
other regulations necessary to carry out the provisions of this

Section 52:
section.
S. For purposes of this section, no member of the Oklahoma
National Guard of the rank of E-8 or E-9 shall be reduced in rank
pursuant to this section except when the reduction results from
nonjudicial punishment imposed by an officer of the Oklahoma
National Guard of the rank of Brigadier General or by the Adjutant
General. When imposing nonjudicial punishment on enlisted persons
of the rank of E-7 or below, a commander or officer in charge who
possesses the rank of colonel may consider reduction in rank as a
possible punishment.

punishment authorized in subsection E of this section.
Admonitions or reprimands given as nonjudicial punishment to
commissioned officers and warrant officers shall be administered in

regulations promulgated by the Adjutant General, such punishments
may be administered either orally or in writing.
G. Whenever any punishments are combined to run consecutively,
the total length of the combined punishment shall not exceed the
authorized duration of the longest punishment included in the
combination, and there shall be an apportionment of punishments so
ENR. H. B. NO. 2769 Page 10

that no single punishment in the combination exceeds its authorized
length under this section.
H. Once the commander commanding officer has determined that
nonjudicial punishment is appropriate, the commander commanding
officer shall provide reasonable notice to the member of his or her
intent to impose nonjudicial punishment. At the time the commander
commanding officer provides notification as required in this
subsection, the member shall be entitled to examine all statements
and other evidence that the commander has examined and intends to
rely upon as the basis for punishment. The member shall be provided
a copy of the documentary evidence unless it is privileged,
classified, or otherwise restricted by law, regulation, or
instruction. At the time the commander commanding officer provides
notification as required in this subsection, the commander
commanding officer shall also inform the member as to the quantum of
punishment potentially to be imposed. While a member undergoing
nonjudicial punishment is not entitled to representation by a duly
appointed defense counsel, the member may seek legal advice from any
judge advocate available for this purpose. Upon notification by the
officer of his or her intent to impose judicial punishment, the
member shall provide a response within forty-five (45) calendar
days.
I. The right to demand trial by court-martial in lieu of
nonjudicial punishment shall arise only when arrest in quarters or
restriction will be considered as punishments. If the commanding
officer determines that arrest in quarters or restriction will be
considered as punishments, prior to the offer of nonjudicial
punishment the accused member shall be notified in writing of the
right to demand trial by court-martial. Should the commanding
officer determine that the punishment options will not include
arrest in quarters or restriction, the accused member shall be
notified that there is no right to trial by court-martial in lieu of
nonjudicial punishment. Upon notification by the commander or
officer in charge commanding officer of his or her intent to impose
nonjudicial punishment that includes arrest in quarters or
restriction, the accused member shall be afforded a reasonable
amount of time to confer with legal counsel and to prepare a
response.
J. The commanding officer who imposes the punishment, or his or
her successor in command, may at any time suspend, set aside,
mitigate or remit any part or amount of the punishment and restore
ENR. H. B. NO. 2769 Page 11

all rights, privileges and property affected. The commanding
officer may also mitigate:
1. Reduction in grade to forfeiture of pay;
2. Arrest in quarters to restriction; or
3. Extra duties to restriction.
The mitigated punishment shall not be for a greater period than
the punishment mitigated. When mitigating reduction in grade to
forfeiture of pay, the amount of the forfeiture shall not be greater
than the amount that could have been imposed initially under this
article by the officer who imposed the punishment mitigated.
K. A person punished under this section who considers the
punishment unjust or disproportionate to the offense may, through
his or her chain of command, appeal to a senior officer designated
by the Adjutant General to adjudicate appeals arising from
nonjudicial punishment. A senior officer so designated by the
Adjutant General shall be a member of the same component of the
state military forces as the accused. An appeal made pursuant to
this subsection shall be lodged within fifteen (15) days after the
punishment is announced to the accused member. The commanding
officer exercising appellate authority may, at his or her
discretion, extend the deadline for an appeal. The appeal shall be
promptly forwarded and decided, and the member shall not be punished
until the appeal is decided. The senior officer designated by the
Adjutant General as exercising appellate authority may exercise the
same powers with respect to the punishment imposed as may be
exercised under subsection I of this section by the officer who
imposed the punishment. Before acting on an appeal from a
punishment, the senior officer exercising appellate authority shall
refer the case to a judge advocate for consideration and advice.
When a senior officer is designated by the Adjutant General to
adjudicate appeals arising from nonjudicial punishment, such
designation shall be accomplished in writing and shall be considered
a military publication, as defined in Section 801 of this title
(Article 1).
L. Except for nonjudicial punishment imposed by the Governor or
the Adjutant General, the final appellate authority for nonjudicial
punishment imposed within state military forces is the Adjutant
General. A person punished under this section whose appeal was
previously denied by a senior officer designated to adjudicate
ENR. H. B. NO. 2769 Page 12

appeals may, through his or her chain of command, lodge an
additional appeal with the Adjutant General within five (5) days
after the appeal is denied. In the event the officer imposing
nonjudicial punishment is a senior officer who is also designated to
adjudicate appeals arising from nonjudicial punishment, an appeal
thereof shall be addressed directly to the Adjutant General. In the
event the officer imposing nonjudicial punishment is the Adjutant
General, an appeal thereof shall be addressed directly to the
Governor. An appeal offered pursuant to this subsection shall be
made only in writing. Neither the Governor nor the Adjutant General
shall delegate his or her duties as an appellate authority under
this subsection.
M. Whenever nonjudicial punishment is imposed under this
section:
1. After adjudication and while the punishment is being carried
out or while the adjudged punishment is pending before the appellate
authority, the commander or officer in charge who imposed the
nonjudicial punishment, upon the request of the accused member, may:
a. excuse the accused member from attendance at scheduled
unit training assemblies, or
b. arrange for the accused member to drill on alternate
dates and in alternate locations; or
2. If necessary to maintain good order and discipline within
the unit, the commander or officer in charge commanding officer who
imposed the nonjudicial punishment may order the accused member to
drill on alternate dates and in alternate locations. The order
shall be reduced to writing and shall become part of the record of
nonjudicial punishment.
N. The imposition and enforcement of disciplinary punishment
under this section for any act or omission shall not be a bar to
trial by court-martial or a civilian court of competent jurisdiction
for a crime or offense arising out of the same act or omission; but
the fact that a disciplinary punishment has been enforced may be
demonstrated by the accused member upon trial and, when so
demonstrated, it shall be considered in determining the measure of
punishment to be adjudged in the event of a finding or verdict of
guilty. Nonjudicial punishment shall not be imposed for an offense

punishment and ready to be considered at that time, including all
offenses arising from a single incident or course of conduct, shall

National Guard of the rank of Brigadier General or by the Adjutant
General. When imposing nonjudicial punishment on enlisted persons
of the rank of E-7 or below, a commander or officer in charge who
possesses the rank of colonel may consider reduction in rank as a

subsection, the amount of any transferred entitlement
under this section that is used by a dependent of the
individual as of the date of such failure shall be
treated as an overpayment of educational assistance
for which the individual shall be solely liable to the
State of Oklahoma for the amount of the overpayment
for purposes of this act in the case of an individual
who fails to complete service agreed to by the
individual:
(1) by reason of death of the individual, or
(2) for a reason referred to in this act.

K. In the case of a dependent to whom entitlement to
educational assistance is transferred under this section who dies

when such transfer is executed.
L. In the case of an individual who transfers entitlement to
