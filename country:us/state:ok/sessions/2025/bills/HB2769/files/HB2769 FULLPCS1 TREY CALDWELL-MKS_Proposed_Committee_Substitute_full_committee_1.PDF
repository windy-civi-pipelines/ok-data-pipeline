21 exercised under subsection I of this section by the officer who
22 imposed the punishment. Before acting on an appeal from a
23 punishment, the senior officer exercising appellate authority shall
24 refer the case to a judge advocate for consideration and advice.

9 General. A person punished under this section whose appeal was
10 previously denied by a senior officer designated to adjudicate
11 appeals may, through his or her chain of command, lodge an
12 additional appeal with the Adjutant General within five (5) days
13 after the appeal is denied. In the event the officer imposing
14 nonjudicial punishment is a senior officer who is also designated to
15 adjudicate appeals arising from nonjudicial punishment, an appeal
16 thereof shall be addressed directly to the Adjutant General. In the
17 event the officer imposing nonjudicial punishment is the Adjutant
18 General, an appeal thereof shall be addressed directly to the
19 Governor. An appeal offered pursuant to this subsection shall be
20 made only in writing. Neither the Governor nor the Adjutant General
21 shall delegate his or her duties as an appellate authority under
22 this subsection.

5 a. excuse the accused member from attendance at scheduled
6 unit training assemblies, or
7 b. arrange for the accused member to drill on alternate
8 dates and in alternate locations; or
9 2. If necessary to maintain good order and discipline within
10 the unit, the commander or officer in charge commanding officer who
11 imposed the nonjudicial punishment may order the accused member to
12 drill on alternate dates and in alternate locations. The order
13 shall be reduced to writing and shall become part of the record of
14 nonjudicial punishment.
15 N. The imposition and enforcement of disciplinary punishment
16 under this section for any act or omission shall not be a bar to
17 trial by court-martial or a civilian court of competent jurisdiction
18 for a crime or offense arising out of the same act or omission; but
19 the fact that a disciplinary punishment has been enforced may be
20 demonstrated by the accused member upon trial and, when so
21 demonstrated, it shall be considered in determining the measure of
22 punishment to be adjudged in the event of a finding or verdict of
23 guilty. Nonjudicial punishment shall not be imposed for an offense
24
Req. No. 13735 Page 19
1 prev iously tried by a civilian court unless so authorized by
2 regulations promulgated by the Adjutant General.
3 O. When nonjudicial punishment has been imposed for an offense,
4 punishment shall not again be imposed for the same offense under
5 this section. Once nonjudicial punishment has been imposed, it may

6 punishment the accused member shall be notified in writing of the
7 right to demand trial by court-martial. Should the commanding
8 officer determine that the punishment options will not include
9 arrest in quarters or restriction, the accused member shall be
10 notified that there is no right to trial by court-martial in lieu of
11 nonjudicial punishment. Upon notification by the commander or
12 officer in charge commanding officer of his or her intent to impose

3 forfeiture of pay, the amount of the forfeiture shall not be greater
4 than the amount that could have been imposed initially under this
5 article by the officer who imposed the punishment mitigated.
6 K. A person punished under this section who considers the
7 punishment unjust or disproportionate to the offense may, through
8 his or her chain of command, appeal to a senior officer designated
9 by the Adjutant General to adjudicate appeals arising from

11 Adjutant General shall be a member of the same component of the
12 state military forces as the accused. An appeal made pursuant to
13 this subsection shall be lodged within fifteen (15) days after the
14 punishment is announced to the accused member. The commanding
15 officer exercising appellate authority may, at his or her
16 discretion, extend the deadline for an appeal. The appeal shall be
17 promptly forwarded and decided, and the member shall not be punished
18 until the appeal is decided. The senior officer designated by the
19 Adjutant General as exercising appellate authority may exercise the
20 same powers with respect to the punishment imposed as may be
21 exercised under subsection I of this section by the officer who
22 imposed the punishment. Before acting on an appeal from a
23 punishment, the senior officer exercising appellate authority shall
24 refer the case to a judge advocate for consideration and advice.
Req. No. 13735 Page 17

1 When a senior officer is designated by the Adjutant General to
2 adjudicate appeals arising from nonjudicial punishment, such
3 designation shall be accomplished in writing and shall be considered
4 a military publication, as defined in Section 801 of this title
5 (Article 1).
6 L. Except for nonjudicial punishment imposed by the Governor or
7 the Adjutant General, the final appellate authority for nonjudicial
8 punishment imposed within state military forces is the Adjutant
9 General. A person punished under this section whose appeal was
10 previously denied by a senior officer designated to adjudicate
11 appeals may, through his or her chain of command, lodge an
12 additional appeal with the Adjutant General within five (5) days
13 after the appeal is denied. In the event the officer imposing
14 nonjudicial punishment is a senior officer who is also designated to
15 adjudicate appeals arising from nonjudicial punishment, an appeal
16 thereof shall be addressed directly to the Adjutant General. In the
17 event the officer imposing nonjudicial punishment is the Adjutant
18 General, an appeal thereof shall be addressed directly to the
19 Governor. An appeal offered pursuant to this subsection shall be
20 made only in writing. Neither the Governor nor the Adjutant General
21 shall delegate his or her duties as an appellate authority under
22 this subsection.
23 M. Whenever nonjudicial punishment is imposed under this
24 section:
Req. No. 13735 Page 18

1 1. After adjudication and while the punishment is being carried
2 out or while the adjudged punishment is pending before the appellate
3 authority, the commander or officer in charge who imposed the
4 nonjudicial punishment, upon the request of the accused member, may:
5 a. excuse the accused member from attendance at scheduled
6 unit training assemblies, or
7 b. arrange for the accused member to drill on alternate
8 dates and in alternate locations; or
9 2. If necessary to maintain good order and discipline within
10 the unit, the commander or officer in charge commanding officer who
11 imposed the nonjudicial punishment may order the accused member to
12 drill on alternate dates and in alternate locations. The order
13 shall be reduced to writing and shall become part of the record of
14 nonjudicial punishment.
15 N. The imposition and enforcement of disciplinary punishment
16 under this section for any act or omission shall not be a bar to
17 trial by court-martial or a civilian court of competent jurisdiction
18 for a crime or offense arising out of the same act or omission; but
19 the fact that a disciplinary punishment has been enforced may be
20 demonstrated by the accused member upon trial and, when so
21 demonstrated, it shall be considered in determining the measure of
22 punishment to be adjudged in the event of a finding or verdict of
23 guilty. Nonjudicial punishment shall not be imposed for an offense
24
Req. No. 13735 Page 19

1 prev iously tried by a civilian court unless so authorized by
2 regulations promulgated by the Adjutant General.
3 O. When nonjudicial punishment has been imposed for an offense,
4 punishment shall not again be imposed for the same offense under
5 this section. Once nonjudicial punishment has been imposed, it may
6 not be increased, upon appeal or otherwise. When a commander or
7 officer in charge commanding officer determines that nonjudicial
8 punishment is appropriate for a particular member, all known
9 offenses determined to be appropriate for disposition by nonjudicial
10 punishment and ready to be considered at that time, including all
11 offenses arising from a single incident or course of conduct, shall
12 be considered together and shall not be made the basis for multiple
13 punishments. This subsection shall in no way restrict the right of
14 a commander commanding officer to prefer court-martial charges for
15 an offense previously punished under the provisions of this section.
16 P. In accordance with subsection B of Section 843 of this title
17 (Article 43, subsection B), a person accused of an offense is not
18 liable to be punished under this section if the offense was
19 committed more than two (2) years before the imposition of
20 punishment. Periods in which the accused member is absent without
21 authority shall be excluded in computing the period of limitation
22 prescribed in this section.
23 Q. Whenever a punishment of forfeiture of pay is imposed under
24 this section, the forfeiture shall not apply to pay accruing before
Req. No. 13735 Page 20

1 the date that punishment is imposed, but only pay accruing on or
2 after the date that punishment is imposed.
3 R. The Adjutant General may promulgate regulations prescribing
4 the type and form of records to be kept of proceedings conducted
5 pursuant to this section. The Adjutant General may promulgate any
6 other regulations necessary to carry out the provisions of this
7 section.
8 S. For purposes of this section, no member of the Oklahoma
9 National Guard of the rank of E-8 or E-9 shall be reduced in rank
10 pursuant to this section except when the reduction results from
11 nonjudicial punishment imposed by an officer of the Oklahoma
12 National Guard of the rank of Brigadier General or by the Adjutant
13 General. When imposing nonjudicial punishment on enlisted persons
14 of the rank of E-7 or below, a commander or officer in charge who
15 possesses the rank of colonel may consider reduction in rank as a
16 possible punishment.
