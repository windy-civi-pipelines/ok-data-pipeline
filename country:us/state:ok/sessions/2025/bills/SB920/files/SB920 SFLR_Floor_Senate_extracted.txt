5 use established program processes or may contract with other
6 qualified entities to carry out the duties and responsibilities of
7 the Unmanned Aircraft Systems Development Act of 2021.
8 B. The primary goal of the clearinghouse within the Department
9 is to establish a central point within state government to develop
10 and implement the strategy for how this state can become a leader in
11 the UAS and AAM industry. It will focus the collective resources,
12 knowledge, information, and assets within state government to ensure
13 coordinated efforts amongst all parties. The clearinghouse will
14 have the authority to:
15 1. Conduct research on what other states and localities are
16 doing insofar as their UAS rules and regulations so that it can
17 provide recommendations to ensure this state is in the best position
18 within the industry;
19 2. Organize and coordinate the application for any UAS and AAM
20 test site, integration opportunity, pilot program or grant funding
21 on behalf of this state;
22 3. Maintain a registry of UAS being operated by state agencies,
23 except those UAS that are part of a university-affiliated research
24 program;
SENATE FLOOR VERSION - SB920 SFLR Page 7
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)
1 4. Maintain a registry of educational institutions that offer
2 training programs for users of UAS; and
3 5. Investigate the development of, and if necessary, create a
4 statewide system plan that will provide the framework for the
5 construction, development, siting, and potential partnerships
6 required for vertiports and other infrastructure needed to integrate
7 AAM and UAS into the existing air transportation system of the
8 state;
9 6. Develop a statewide network of UAS and AAM detection systems
10 as necessary to support the safe integration of these technologies
11 into the state’s existing air transportation system; and
12 7. Create statewide or regional command, control, and radar
13 systems or centers to carry out the provisions of paragraph 6 of
14 this subsection and the Department’s efforts to bring UAS and AAM
15 testing and development to the state. These systems or centers can
16 be stand-alone or in partnership with other federal, state, local,
17 tribal, or non-profit entities.
18 C. The Department is authorized to enter into partnerships with
19 any city or town of this state and any county or political
20 subdivision or district in this state, or any public trust thereof,
21 or any federal government entity for the purpose of investing in and
22 operating infrastructure and any other items necessary to safely and
23 effectively integrate AAM and UAS into the existing air
