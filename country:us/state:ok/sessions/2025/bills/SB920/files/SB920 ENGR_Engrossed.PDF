ENGR. S. B. NO. 920 Page 2

1 Section 102.1. A. In order to prevent the erection of
2 structures dangerous to air navigation, subject to the provisions of
3 subsections B, C and D of this section, each person shall secure
4 from the local airport zoning authority, or in the absence of a
5 local airport zoning authority, the Oklahoma Department of Aerospace
6 and Aeronautics, a permit for the erection, alteration, or
7 modification of any structure the result of which would exceed the
8 federal obstruction standards as contained in 14 CFR, Part 77.
9 Permits from the local airport zoning authority will be required
10 only within an airport hazard area where federal standards are
11 exceeded and if the proposed construction is within:
12 1. A 10-nautical mile radius of the geographical center of a
13 publicly owned or operated airport, a military airport, or an
14 airport open for public use which has a published instrument
15 approach procedure;
16 2. A 6-nautical mile radius of the geographical center of a
17 publicly owned or operated airport, a military airport, or an
18 airport open for public use which has no published instrument
19 approach procedure and has runways in excess of three thousand two
20 hundred (3,200) feet in length; or
21 3. A 2.5-nautical mile radius of the geographical center of a
22 publicly owned or operated airport, a military airport, or an
23 airport open for public use which has no published instrument
24
ENGR. S. B. NO. 920 Page 3

1 appr oach and has runways three thousand two hundred (3,200) feet or
2 less in length; or
3 4. A 1-nautical mile radius of the geographical center of a
4 publicly owned or operated heliport or vertiport.
5 B. Affected airports will be considered as having those
6 facilities which are programmed in the Federal Aviation
7 Administration’s Regional Aviation System Plan or the Oklahoma
8 Department of Aerospace and Aeronautics’ Oklahoma Airport System
9 Plan and will be so protected.
10 C. Permit requirements of subsection A of this section shall
11 not apply to projects which received construction permits from the
12 Federal Communications Commission for structures exceeding federal
13 obstruction standards prior to May 20, 1975; nor shall it apply to
14 previously approved structures now existing, or any necessary
15 replacement or repairs to such existing structures, so long as the
16 height and location is unchanged.
17 D. In determining whether to issue or deny a permit, the local
18 airport zoning authority shall consider:
19 1. The nature of the terrain and height of existing structures;
20 2. Public and private interests and investments;
21 3. The character of flying operations and planned developments
22 of airports, heliports, and vertiports;
23
24
ENGR. S. B. NO. 920 Page 4

1 4. Federal airways as designated by the Federal Aviation
2 Administration that lie within the radii described in paragraphs 1
3 through 3 of subsection A of this section;
4 5. Whether the construction of the proposed structure would
5 cause an increase in the minimum descent altitude or the decision
6 height at the affected airport;
7 6. Technological advances;
8 7. The safety of persons on the ground and in the air; and
9 8. Land use density.
10 E. In order to promote the health, safety, and welfare of the
11 public and to protect persons and property by promoting safety in
12 aeronautics, the Oklahoma Department of Aerospace and Aeronautics
13 may review any structure erected, altered, or modified since January
14 1, 1996, in which no permit was secured from the local airport
15 zoning authority because of the absence of a local airport
16 authority. The Oklahoma Department of Aerospace and Aeronautics
17 shall determine whether such structures meet the requirements set
18 forth in this section. If the structures do not meet the
19 requirements as set forth in this section, the Oklahoma Department
20 of Aerospace and Aeronautics may request the owners of such
21 structure to make any necessary modifications to protect the health,
22 safety, and welfare of the public, including, but not limited to,
23 altering, marking, mapping, or identifying such structure. The
24 Oklahoma Department of Aerospace and Aeronautics may assist the
ENGR. S. B. NO. 920 Page 5

1 owne r of such structure in any manner deemed feasible by the
2 Oklahoma Department of Aerospace and Aeronautics.
3 SECTION 3. AMENDATORY 3 O.S. 2021, Section 421, as last
4 amended by Section 15, Chapter 135, O.S.L. 2024 (3 O.S. Supp. 2024,
5 Section 421), is amended to read as follows:
6 Section 421. A. The Oklahoma Department of Aerospace and
7 Aeronautics is hereby established as the clearinghouse for unmanned
8 aircraft systems (UAS) and advanced air mobility (AAM) in this state
9 and shall be designated as the agency of this state for the
10 promotion, enhancement, and development of UAS and AAM as well as
11 any associated infrastructure necessary to ensure the safe
12 integration and use of this new technology within the state. The
13 purpose of this clearinghouse is to create a partnership between
14 those entities that currently operate UAS, those that desire to use
15 this technology in the future and other entities that can support
16 the research and development of UAS to ensure that this state can
17 more effectively respond to the needs of this critical sector of the
18 aviation and aerospace industry. In the operation of this
19 clearinghouse, the Department shall cooperate, assist and coordinate
20 with the federal government, agencies of this state, tribal
21 entities, municipalities, and other persons in the development of
22 unmanned aircraft systems throughout the state to ensure the
23 acceptance of this technology and the successful integration of UAS
24 into the National Airspace System. Contingent upon the availability
ENGR. S. B. NO. 920 Page 6

1 of f unds, the Oklahoma Department of Aerospace and Aeronautics may
2 use established program processes or may contract with other
3 qualified entities to carry out the duties and responsibilities of
4 the Unmanned Aircraft Systems Development Act of 2021.
5 B. The primary goal of the clearinghouse within the Department
6 is to establish a central point within state government to develop
7 and implement the strategy for how this state can become a leader in
8 the UAS and AAM industry. It will focus the collective resources,
9 knowledge, information, and assets within state government to ensure
10 coordinated efforts amongst all parties. The clearinghouse will
11 have the authority to:
12 1. Conduct research on what other states and localities are
13 doing insofar as their UAS rules and regulations so that it can
14 provide recommendations to ensure this state is in the best position
15 within the industry;
16 2. Organize and coordinate the application for any UAS and AAM
17 test site, integration opportunity, pilot program or grant funding
18 on behalf of this state;
19 3. Maintain a registry of UAS being operated by state agencies,
20 except those UAS that are part of a university-affiliated research
21 program;
22 4. Maintain a registry of educational institutions that offer
23 training programs for users of UAS; and
24
ENGR. S. B. NO. 920 Page 7

1 5. Investigate the development of, and if necessary, create a
2 statewide system plan that will provide the framework for the
3 construction, development, siting, and potential partnerships
4 required for vertiports and other infrastructure needed to integrate
5 AAM and UAS into the existing air transportation system of the
6 state;
7 6. Develop a statewide network of UAS and AAM detection systems
8 as necessary to support the safe integration of these technologies
9 into the state’s existing air transportation system; and
10 7. Create statewide or regional command, control, and radar
11 systems or centers to carry out the provisions of paragraph 6 of
12 this subsection and the Department’s efforts to bring UAS and AAM
13 testing and development to the state. These systems or centers can
14 be stand-alone or in partnership with other federal, state, local,
15 tribal, or non-profit entities.
16 C. The Department is authorized to enter into partnerships with
17 any city or town of this state and any county or political
18 subdivision or district in this state, or any public trust thereof,
19 or any federal government entity for the purpose of investing in and
20 operating infrastructure and any other items necessary to safely and
21 effectively integrate AAM and UAS into the existing air
22 transportation system of this state as well as the testing and
23 development of these aeronautical technologies.
24 SECTION 4. This act shall become effective November 1, 2025.
