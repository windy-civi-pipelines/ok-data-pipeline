10
11
aircraft systems (UAS) and advanced air mobility (AAM) in this state
11
12
and shall be designated as the agency of this state for the

integration and use of this new technology within the state. The
15
16
purpose of this clearinghouse is to create a partnership between
16
17
those entities that currently operate UAS, those that desire to use
17
18
this technology in the future and other entities that can support
18
19
the research and development of UAS to ensure that this state can
19
20
more effectively respond to the needs of this critical sector of the
20
21
aviation and aerospace industry. In the operation of this
21
22
clearinghouse, the Department shall cooperate, assist and coordinate

B. The primary goal of the clearinghouse within the Department
8
9
is to establish a central point within state government to develop
9
10
and implement the strategy for how this state can become a leader in
10
11
the UAS and AAM industry. It will focus the collective resources,
11
12
knowledge, information, and assets within state government to ensure
12
13
coordinated efforts amongst all parties. The clearinghouse will
13
14
have the authority to:
14
15
1. Conduct research on what other states and localities are
15
16
doing insofar as their UAS rules and regulations so that it can
16
17
provide recommendations to ensure this state is in the best position
17
18
within the industry;
18
19
2. Organize and coordinate the application for any UAS and AAM
19
20
test site, integration opportunity, pilot program or grant funding
20
21
on behalf of this state;
21
22
3. Maintain a registry of UAS being operated by state agencies,
22
23
except those UAS that are part of a university-affiliated research
23
24
program;
24
Req. No. 436 Page 7

statewide system plan that will provide the framework for the
4
5
construction, development, siting, and potential partnerships
5
6
required for vertiports and other infrastructure needed to integrate
6
7
AAM and UAS into the existing air transportation system of the
7
8
state;
8
9
6. Develop a statewide network of UAS and AAM detection systems
9
10
as necessary to support the safe integration of these technologies
10
11
into the state’s existing air transportation system; and
11
12
7. Create statewide or regional command, control, and radar
12
13
systems or centers to carry out the provisions of paragraph 6 of
13
14
this subsection and the Department’s efforts to bring UAS and AAM
14
15
testing and development to the state. These systems or centers can
15
16
be stand-alone or in partnership with other federal, state, local,
16
17
tribal, or non-profit entities.
17
18
C. The Department is authorized to enter into partnerships with

subdivision or district in this state, or any public trust thereof,
20
21
or any federal government entity for the purpose of investing in and
21
22
operating infrastructure and any other items necessary to safely and
22
23
