Section 21:
SECTION 2. AMENDATORY 22 O.S. 2021, Section 60.17, is
3
4
amended to read as follows:
4
5

Section 22:
Section 60.17. The court shall consider the safety of any and
5
6
all alleged victims of domestic violence, stalking, harassment,
6
7
sexual assault, or forcible sodomy where the defendant is alleged to
7
8
have violated a protective order, committed domestic assault and
8
9
battery, stalked, sexually assaulted, or forcibly sodomized the
9
10
alleged victim or victims prior to the release of the alleged
10
11
defendant from custody on bond. The court, after consideration and
11
12
to ensure the safety of the alleged victim or victims, may issue an
12
13
emergency protective order pursuant to the Protection from Domestic
13
14
Abuse Act. The court may also issue to the alleged victim or
14
15
victims an order restraining the alleged defendant from any activity
15
16
or action from which they may be restrained under the Protection
16
17
from Domestic Abuse Act. The court shall not consider a “no contact
17
18
order as condition of bond” as a factor when determining whether the
18
19
petitioner is eligible for relief. The protective order shall
19
20
remain in effect until either a plea has been accepted, sentencing
20
21
has occurred in the case, the case has been dismissed, or until
21
22
further order of the court dismissing the protective order. In
22
23
conjunction with any protective order or restraining order
23
24
authorized by this section, the court may shall order the defendant
24
Req. No. 857 Page 9
1
to use an active, real-time, twenty-four-hour Global Positioning
1
2
System (GPS) monitoring device for such term as the court deems
2
3
appropriate as long as the protective order or restraining order
3
4
remains in effect. Upon application of the victim, the court may
4
5
authorize the victim to monitor the location of the defendant. Such
5
6
monitoring by the victim shall be limited to the ability of the
6
7
victim to make computer or cellular inquiries to determine if the
7
8
defendant is within a specified distance of locations, excluding the
8
9
residence or workplace of the defendant, or to receive a computer-
9
10
or a cellular-generated signal if the defendant comes within a
10
11
specified distance of the victim. The court shall conduct an annual
11
12
review of the monitoring order to determine if such order to monitor
12
13
the location of the defendant is still necessary. Before the court
13
14
orders the use of a GPS device, the court shall find that the
14
15
defendant has a history that demonstrates an intent to commit
15
16
violence against the victim, including, but not limited to, prior
16
17
conviction for an offense under the Protection from Domestic Abuse
17
18
Act or any other violent offense, or any other evidence that shows
18
19
by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant is likely to
19
20
commit violence against the victim. The court may further order the
20
21
defendant to pay costs and expenses related to the GPS device and
21
22
monitoring.
22
23

Section 23:
SECTION 3. This act shall become effective July 1, 2025.

be in full force from and after its passage and approval.

15
defendant during the course of ordered counseling
15
16
through the final review hearing;
16
17

18
court determines necessary to assure the defendant attends and fully
18
19
complies with the provisions of this subsection and the domestic
19
20

15
16
H. At no time, under any proceeding, may a person protected by
16
17
a protective order be held to be in violation of that protective
17
18
order. Only a defendant against whom a protective order has been
18
19
issued may be held to have violated the order.
19
20
I. In addition to any other penalty specified by this section,
20
21
the court may shall order a defendant to use an active, real-time,

23
as a condition of a sentence. The court may further order the
23
24
24
Req. No. 857 Page 8

defendant to pay costs and expenses related to the GPS device and
1

monitoring.

SECTION 2. AMENDATORY 22 O.S. 2021, Section 60.17, is
3
4
amended to read as follows:
4
5
Section 60.17. The court shall consider the safety of any and
5
6
all alleged victims of domestic violence, stalking, harassment,
6
7
sexual assault, or forcible sodomy where the defendant is alleged to
7
8
have violated a protective order, committed domestic assault and
8
9
battery, stalked, sexually assaulted, or forcibly sodomized the
9
10
alleged victim or victims prior to the release of the alleged
10
11
defendant from custody on bond. The court, after consideration and
11
12
to ensure the safety of the alleged victim or victims, may issue an
12
13
emergency protective order pursuant to the Protection from Domestic
13
14
Abuse Act. The court may also issue to the alleged victim or
14
15
victims an order restraining the alleged defendant from any activity
15
16
or action from which they may be restrained under the Protection
16
17
from Domestic Abuse Act. The court shall not consider a “no contact
17
18
order as condition of bond” as a factor when determining whether the
18
19
petitioner is eligible for relief. The protective order shall
19
20
remain in effect until either a plea has been accepted, sentencing
20
21
has occurred in the case, the case has been dismissed, or until
21
22
further order of the court dismissing the protective order. In
22
23
conjunction with any protective order or restraining order
23
24
authorized by this section, the court may shall order the defendant
24
Req. No. 857 Page 9

1
to use an active, real-time, twenty-four-hour Global Positioning
1
2
System (GPS) monitoring device for such term as the court deems
2
3
appropriate as long as the protective order or restraining order
3
4
remains in effect. Upon application of the victim, the court may
4
5
authorize the victim to monitor the location of the defendant. Such
5
6
monitoring by the victim shall be limited to the ability of the
6
7
victim to make computer or cellular inquiries to determine if the
7
8
defendant is within a specified distance of locations, excluding the
8
9
residence or workplace of the defendant, or to receive a computer-
9
10
or a cellular-generated signal if the defendant comes within a
10
11
specified distance of the victim. The court shall conduct an annual
11
12
review of the monitoring order to determine if such order to monitor
12
13
the location of the defendant is still necessary. Before the court
13
14
orders the use of a GPS device, the court shall find that the
14
15
defendant has a history that demonstrates an intent to commit
15
16
violence against the victim, including, but not limited to, prior
16
17
conviction for an offense under the Protection from Domestic Abuse
17
18
Act or any other violent offense, or any other evidence that shows
18
19
by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant is likely to
19
20
commit violence against the victim. The court may further order the
20
21
defendant to pay costs and expenses related to the GPS device and
21
22
monitoring.
22
23
SECTION 3. This act shall become effective July 1, 2025.
