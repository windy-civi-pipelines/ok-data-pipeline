20 SECTION 1. NEW LAW A new section of law to be codified
21 in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 4005 of Title 56, unless there
22 is created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:
23 A. For purposes of this section, "rapid whole genome sequencing
24 (RWGS)" is defined as an investigation of the entire human genome,
HB1576 HFLR Page 1
BOLD FACE denotes Committee Amendments.
1 incl uding coding and non-coding regions and mitochondrial
2 deoxyribonucleic acid, to identify disease-causing genetic changes
3 that returns the preliminary positive results within seven (7) days
4 and final results within fifteen (15) to twenty-one (21) days from
5 the date of receipt of the sample by the lab performing the test,
6 and includes patient-only whole genome sequencing (WGS) and duo and
7 trio whole genome sequencing of the patient and biological parent or
8 parents.
9 B. Subject to any required approval of the Centers for Medicare
10 and Medicaid Services, the Oklahoma Health Care Authority shall
11 include coverage of rapid whole genome sequencing as a separately
12 payable service for Medicaid beneficiaries when all of the following
13 criteria are met:
14 1. Beneficiary is under twenty-one (21) years of age;
15 2. Beneficiary has a complex or acute illness of unknown
16 etiology, that is not confirmed to be caused by an environmental
17 exposure, toxic ingestion, infection with normal response to
18 therapy, or trauma; and
19 3. Beneficiary is receiving hospital services in an intensive
20 care unit or other high acuity care unit within a hospital.
21 C. The coverage provided pursuant to this section may be
22 subject to applicable evidence-based medical necessity criteria that
23 shall be based on all of the following:
24
HB1576 HFLR Page 2
BOLD FACE denotes Committee Amendments.
1 1. The patient has symptoms that suggest a broad differential
2 diagnosis that would require an evaluation by multiple genetic tests
3 if rapid whole genome sequencing is not performed;
4 2. The patient's treating healthcare provider has determined
5 that timely identification of a molecular diagnosis is necessary to
6 guide clinical decision-making and testing results may guide the
7 treatment or management of the patient's condition; and
8 3. The patient has a complex or acute illness of unknown
9 etiology, including at least one of the following conditions:
10 a. congenital anomalies involving at least two organ
11 systems or complex and multiple congenital anomalies
12 in one organ system,
13 b. specific organ malformations highly suggestive of a
14 genetic etiology,
15 c. abnormal laboratory tests or abnormal chemistry
16 profiles suggesting the presence of a genetic disease,
17 complex metabolic disorder, or inborn error of
18 metabolism,
19 d. refractory or severe hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia,
20 e. abnormal response to therapy related to an underlying
21 medical condition affecting vital organs or bodily
22 systems,
23 f. severe muscle weakness, rigidity, or spasticity,
24 g. refractory seizures,
HB1576 HFLR Page 3
BOLD FACE denotes Committee Amendments.
1 h. a high-risk stratification on evaluation for a brief
2 resolved unexplained event with any of the following:
3 (1) a recurrent event without respiratory infection,
4 (2) a recurrent event witnessed seizure-like event,
5 or
6 (3) a recurrent cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
7 i. abnormal cardiac diagnostic testing results suggestive
8 of possible channelopathies, arrhythmias,
9 cardiomyopathies, myocarditis, or structural heart
10 disease,
11 j. abnormal diagnostic imaging studies suggestive of
12 underlying genetic condition,
13 k. abnormal physiologic function studies suggestive of an
14 underlying genetic etiology, or
15 l. family genetic history related to the patient's
16 condition.
17 D. Nothing in this section prohibits the Chief Operating
18 Officer of the Oklahoma Health Care Authority from adding additional
19 conditions to those contained in paragraph 3 of subsection C based
20 upon new medical evidence or from providing coverage for rapid whole
21 genome sequencing or other next generation sequencing (NGS) and
22 genetic testing for Medicaid beneficiaries that is in addition to
23 the coverage required under this section.
24

1 E. Genetic data generated as a result of performing rapid whole
2 genome sequencing, covered pursuant to this section, shall have a
3 primary use of assisting the ordering health care professional and
4 treating care team to diagnose and treat the patient, and as
5 protected health information it shall be subject to the requirements
6 applicable to protected health information as set forth in the
7 Health Information Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), the
8 Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act,

10 HIPAA privacy rule as promulgated at 45 CFR Part 160 and Subparts A
11 and E of 45 CFR Part 164.
12 F. Genetic data generated from rapid whole genome sequencing,
13 covered pursuant to this section, can be used in scientific research
14 if consent for such use of the data has been expressly given by the
15 patient, or the patient's legal guardian in the case of a minor.
16 The patient, the patient's legal guardian in the case of a minor, or
17 the patient's health care provider with the patient's consent, may
18 request access to the results of the testing covered by this section
19 for use in other clinical settings. A health care provider may only
20 charge a small fee to the patient based on the direct costs of
21 producing the results in a format usable in other clinical settings.
22 A patient, or patient's legal guardian in the case of a minor, shall
23 have the right to rescind the original consent to the use of the
24 data in scientific research at any time, and upon receipt of a
HB1576 HFLR Page 5

1 writ ten revocation of the consent the health care provider or other
2 entity using the data shall cease use and expunge the data from any
3 data repository where it is held.

7 the following:
8 1. Promulgation of rules and regulations to provide for
9 Medicaid coverage pursuant to this section;
10 2. Submission to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services
11 of any new waiver application, amendment to an existing waiver, or

14 3. Any other administrative action determined by the Chief
15 Operating Officer as necessary to implement the requirements of this
16 section.
17 SECTION 2. This act shall become effective July 1, 2025.
18 SECTION 3. It being immediately necessary for the preservation
19 of the public peace, health or safety, an emergency is hereby
20 declared to exist, by reason whereof this act shall take effect and
21 be in full force from and after its passage and approval.
