6 stalking, or harassment. The emergency ex parte order shall be in
7 effect until after the full hearing is conducted. Provided, if the
8 defendant, after having been served, does not appear at the hearing,
9 the emergency ex parte order shall remain in effect until the
10 defendant is served with the permanent order. If the terms of the
11 permanent order are the same as those in the emergency order, or are
12 less restrictive, then it is not necessary to serve the defendant
13 with the permanent order. The Administrative Office of the Courts
14 shall develop a standard form for emergency ex parte protective
15 orders.

2 When the order is issued verbally the judge shall direct the officer
3 to complete and sign a statement attesting to the order. The

5 court date that was assigned by the court during the approval of the
6 order. Emergency temporary ex parte orders shall be heard within
7 fourteen (14) days after issuance. The court shall provide a list
8 of available court dates for hearings.
9 2. The peace officer shall make every attempt to serve the
10 subject of the order and complete a return of service when filing

13 officer with the district court the next business day. The court
14 clerk shall receive the petition upon delivery by the peace officer
15 and document the hearing date and time assigned to the case as

19 sheriff to obtain service with priority.

14 in the presence of the peace officer. A peace officer may not
