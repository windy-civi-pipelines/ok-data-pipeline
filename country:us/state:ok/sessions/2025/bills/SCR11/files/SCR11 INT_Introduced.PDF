9
reduce the individual income tax rate by 0.25% point;
10
urging fiscal restraint in agency reductions to
10
protect taxpayer services; recognizing historic state
11
savings; emphasizing responsible governance and the
11
will of the people; reaffirming the principles of
12
limited government and economic liberty; and
12
directing distribution.
13
13
14
14
15
WHEREAS, the State of Oklahoma currently maintains over $5
15
16
billion in reserve savings, with the majority of those funds readily
16
17
available, placing the state in its strongest financial position in
17
18
history; and
18
19
WHEREAS, Oklahoma families continue to bear the burdens of
19
20
inflation and economic uncertainty, and the state has a
20
21
responsibility to return excess revenue to the hardworking taxpayers
21
22
when fiscally feasible; and
22
23
23
24
24
Req. No. 2105 Page 1
1
WHEREAS, tax relief will keep more money in the pockets of
1
2
Oklahomans, allowing them to spend and invest in their communities,
2
3
supporting local businesses and strengthening the state economy; and
3
4
WHEREAS, Oklahomans know best how to spend their money, and the
4
5
government should not penalize individuals for their productivity
5
6
through excessive taxation; and
6
7
WHEREAS, Oklahomans who get up every day to go to work should
7
8
not be punished by an income tax as a tax on work is a tax on the
8
9
backbone of our state; and
9
10
WHEREAS, many state agencies are being funded for vacant
10
11
positions that have gone unfilled for months or years, resulting in
11
12
millions of dollars in unnecessary appropriations with no return for
12
13
the taxpayer; and
13
14
WHEREAS, bloated agency administrations and layers of
14
15
bureaucracy reduce economic efficiency and make it harder for state
15
16
government to fulfill its most essential responsibilities; and
16
17
WHEREAS, the Governor has proposed a 0.5% point income tax cut
17
18
to be offset by a 2% across-the-board reduction to all agencies and
18
19
elimination of long-vacant jobs; and
19
20
WHEREAS, the bloat and inefficiencies in government would allow
20
21
for across-the-board cuts without the risk of undermining core
21
22
services such as education, public safety, and health care, as some
22
23
agencies have suggested they could be cut by as much as 10%; and
23
24
24
Req. No. 2105 Page 2
1
WHEREAS, government growth in recent years has outpaced
1
2
population growth, and it is time to return to a limited government
2
3
focused on its core functions, not expanding bureaucracies; and
3
4
WHEREAS, the majority of the members of the Legislature were
4
5
elected on platforms promising to reduce waste, cut taxes, and
5
6
deliver a government that serves the people, not itself; and
6
7
WHEREAS, polling and public feedback consistently show that
7
8
Oklahomans overwhelmingly support a tax cut, and expect their
8
9
elected leaders to deliver real relief without damaging public
9
10
services; and
10
11
WHEREAS, Oklahoma has responsibly reduced its top individual
11
12
income tax rate from a high of 7.0% in prior decades to the current
12
13
rate of 4.75%, and during that time, overall state revenues have
13
14
continued to grow due to a stronger economy, population gains, and a
14
15
broader tax base; and
15
16
WHEREAS, a 0.25% point tax cut is a fiscally responsible middle
16
17
ground that reflects conservative values, honors the intent of
17
18
taxpayers, and maintains the long-term stability of state finances.
18
19
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE OF THE 1ST SESSION
19
20
OF THE 60TH OKLAHOMA LEGISLATURE, THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

Req. No. 2105 Page 3
1
THAT the Legislature encourages immediate tax relief as a means
1
2
to strengthen economic growth, empower working families, and reduce
2
3
dependency on the government by letting Oklahomans keep more of what
3
4
they earn.
4
5
THAT the Legislature urges targeted agency budget reductions so
5
6
that vital public services and frontline needs are protected while
6
7
bureaucratic overhead is eliminated.
7
8
THAT the Legislature calls for agency accountability, including

9
a thorough review of appropriations for persistently unfilled full-
9
10
time positions, and directs efforts to streamline management, reduce
10

overhead, and eliminate waste.
11
12
THAT the Legislature reaffirms its commitment to limited,
12
13
efficient government focused on protecting rights, delivering core
13

services, and returning surplus dollars to the people.
