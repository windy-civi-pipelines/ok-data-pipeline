6 SECTION 4. NEW LAW A new section of law to be codified
7 in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 1778 of Title 12, unless there
8 is created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:
9 A. Every case that follows the expedited actions process shall
10 be governed by the discovery control plan provided for in this
11 section. Discovery is subject to the limitations provided for in

13 following additional limitations:
14 1. In a suit not governed by Title 43 of the Oklahoma
15 Statutes, all discovery must be conducted during the discovery
16 period, which begins when the first initial disclosures are due and
17 continues for one hundred eighty (180) days. In a suit governed by
18 Title 43 of the Oklahoma Statutes, all discovery must be conducted
19 during the discovery period, which begins when the suit is filed and
20 continues until one hundred eighty (180) days after the first
21 request for discovery of any kind is served on a party;
22 2. Each party may have no more than twenty (20) hours in total
23 to examine and cross-examine all witnesses in oral depositions. The

6 subpart of an interrogatory is considered a separate interrogatory;

8 written requests for production. Each discrete subpart of a request
9 for production is considered a separate request for production; and
10 5. Any party may serve on any other party no more than fifteen
11 written requests for admissions. Each discrete subpart of a request
12 for admission is considered a separate request for admission.
13 B. If a suit is removed from the expedited actions process or,
14 in a divorce, the filing of a pleading renders this subdivision no
15 longer applicable, the discovery period reopens, and discovery must
16 be completed within the limitations provided in Section 3226 of

18 may be redeposed. On motion of any party, the court should continue

10 party, the court may extend the time limit to no more than twelve
11 (12) hours per side.
12 B. The term "side" is not synonymous with "party", "litigant",
13 or "person". Rather, "side" means one or more litigants who have
14 common interests on the matters with which the jury is concerned.

16 exception, and challenges for cause to a juror are not included in
