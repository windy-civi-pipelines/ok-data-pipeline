5 court shall reopen discovery.
6 SECTION 4. NEW LAW A new section of law to be codified
7 in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 1778 of Title 12, unless there
8 is created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:
9 A. Every case that follows the expediated actions process shall
10 be governed by the discovery control plan provided for in this
11 Section. Discovery is subject to the limitations provided for in
12 Section 3226 of Title 12 of the Oklahoma Statutes and to the
13 following additional limitations:
14 1. In a suit not governed by Title 43 of the Oklahoma
15 Statutes, all discovery must be conducted during the discovery
16 period, which begins when the first initial disclosures are due and
17 continues for one hundred eighty (180) days. In a suit governed by
18 Title 43 of the Oklahoma Statutes, all discovery must be conducted
19 during the discovery period, which begins when the suit is filed and
20 continues until one hundred eighty (180) days after the first
21 request for discovery of any kind is served on a party;
22 2. Each party may have no more than twenty (20) hours in total
23 to examine and cross-examine all witnesses in oral depositions. The
24

2 unfair advantage;
3 3. Any party may serve on any other party no more than fifteen
4 (15) written interrogatories, excluding interrogatories asking a
5 party only to identify or authenticate specific documents. Each
6 discrete subpart of an interrogatory is considered a separate
7 interrogatory;
8 4. Any party may serve on any other party no more than fifteen
9 (15) written requests for production. Each discrete subpart of a
10 request for production is considered a separate request for
11 production; and
12 5. Any party may serve on any other party no more than fifteen
13 (15) written requests for admissions. Each discrete subpart of a
14 request for admission is considered a separate request for
15 admission.
16 B. If a suit is removed from the expedited actions process or,
17 in a divorce, the filing of a pleading renders this subdivision no
18 longer applicable, the discovery period reopens, and discovery must
19 be completed within the limitations provided in Section 3226 of
20 Title 12 of the Oklahoma Statutes. Any person previously deposed
21 may be redeposed. On motion of any party, the court should continue
22 the trial date if necessary to permit completion of discovery.

16 (12) hours per side.
