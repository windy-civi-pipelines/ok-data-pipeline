F. At a hearing in which the establishment licensed by the ABLE
9
10
Commission asserts the affirmative defense established in this act,
10
11
the Commission may present evidence to establish a rebuttable
11
12
presumption under this section. If the evidence is sufficient to
12

14
proceeding shifts to the establishment licensed by the ABLE

16
of the law within the meaning of this act.

this act.
