17 B. The following actions of an employee of a licensed
18 establishment are not attributable to the licensed establishment:
19 1. The selling, furnishing, or giving of an alcoholic beverage
20 to:

7 employee license from the ABLE Commission;
8 2. Required each employee to present a seller-server training
9 certificate within fourteen (14) days of his or her initial
10 employment date, unless the employee is deemed exempt by an existing
11 statute and required each employee to attend a seller-server
12 training course every two (2) years upon renewal of the employee
13 license and attend a seller-server training course every two (2)
14 years after the initial employment date, unless an employee is

9 employee was terminated.
10 D. A licensed establishment asserting the affirmative defense
11 under this act shall provide to the ABLE Commission, not later than
12 ten (10) days after receipt of an administrative notice of
13 violation, an affidavit indicating that the licensed establishment
14 was in compliance with the requirements of this act at the time of
15 the violation for which the administrative notice was issued, which
16 shall include a copy of the valid employee license held by the
17 employee who committed the alleged violation, a copy of the current
18 training certificate held by that employee, and a signed copy of

Req. No. 13492 Page 4

1 E. When an employee does not possess a currently valid employee
2 license from the ABLE Commission, the action of the employee shall
3 be attributable to the licensed establishment.
4 F. Proof by the ABLE Commission that an employee performed an
5 action described in this act on three or more occasions within a
6 twelve-month period shall create a rebuttable presumption that a
7 licensed establishment has indirectly encouraged a violation of the
8 law pursuant to this act. The rebuttable presumption is created
9 regardless of whether the employee performing the action described
10 in this subsection on a second or subsequent occasion is the same
11 employee who performed the initial action. Proof of violation shall
12 be demonstrated by:
13 1. Producing final orders issued by the ABLE Commission or a
14 court of competent jurisdiction finding that the licensed
15 establishment violated this act on two previous occasions; and
16 2. Establishing a prima facie case that an employee of the
17 licensed establishment violated this act on a third or subsequent
18 occasion.
19 G. Proof of violation of this act shall be for the same type of
20 offense and shall have occurred within a twelve-month period, as
21 calculated from the dates the incidents occurred.
22 H. At a hearing in which the licensed establishment asserts the
23 affirmative defense established in this act, the ABLE Commission may
24 present evidence to establish a rebuttable presumption under this
Req. No. 13492 Page 5

1 act. If the evidence is sufficient to establish a prima facie case,
2 the burden of persuasion in the proceeding shifts to the licensed
3 establishment to show that it has not indirectly encouraged a
4 violation of the law within the meaning of this act.
5 I. Nothing in this act shall be construed to establish
6 exclusive means by which the ABLE Commission may establish that a
7 licensed establishment has indirectly encouraged a violation of this
8 act.
9 SECTION 3. This act shall become effective November 1, 2025.
