12 action. Proof of violation shall be demonstrated by:
13 1. Producing final orders issued by the ABLE Commission or a

11 employee license from the ABLE Commission;
12 3. Adopting written policies and procedures that are designed

ENGR. S. B. NO. 1032 Page 4
1 4. Ensuring that all employees have read and understood the
2 ABLE Commission’s policies and procedures established in this act,

10 presumption under this section. If the evidence is sufficient to

12 proceeding shifts to the establishment licensed by the ABLE
13 Commission to show that it has not indirectly encouraged a violation
14 of the law within the meaning of this act.
15 G. Nothing in this act shall be construed to establish
16 exclusive means by which the ABLE Commission may establish that a
17 license or permit holder has indirectly encouraged a violation of
18 this act.
