14 proceeding shifts to the establishment licensed by the ABLE
15 Commission to show that it has not indirectly encouraged a violation
16 of the law within the meaning of this act.
17 G. Nothing in this act shall be construed to establish
18 exclusive means by which the ABLE Commission may establish that a
19 license or permit holder has indirectly encouraged a violation of
20 this act.
21 SECTION 3. This act shall become effective November 1, 2025.
