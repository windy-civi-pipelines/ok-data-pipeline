24
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2140 Page 10

1 The Ad Valorem Division of the Oklahoma Tax Commission shall be
2 responsible for the promulgation of rules which shall be followed by
3 each county assessor of the state, for the purposes of providing for
4 the equitable use valuation of locally assessed real property in
5 this state. Agricultural land and nonresidential improvements
6 necessary or convenient for agricultural purposes shall be assessed
7 for ad valorem taxation based upon the highest and best use for
8 which the property was actually used, or was previously classified
9 for use, during the calendar year next preceding January 1 on which
10 the assessment is made.
11 C. The use value of agricultural land shall be based on the
12 income capitalization approach using cash rent. The rental income
13 shall be calculated using the direct capitalization method based
14 upon factors including, but not limited to:
15 1. Soil types, as depicted on soil maps published by the
16 Natural Resources Conservation Service of the United States
17 Department of Agriculture;
18 2. Soil productivity indices approved by the Ad Valorem
19 Division of the Tax Commission;
20 3. The specific agricultural purpose of the soil based on use
21 categories approved by the Ad Valorem Division of the Tax
22 Commission; and
23 4. A capitalization rate to be determined annually by the Ad
24 Valorem Division of the Tax Commission based on the sum of the
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2140 Page 11

1 aver age first mortgage interest rate charged by the Federal Land
2 Bank for the immediately preceding five (5) years, weighted with the
3 prevailing rate or rates for additional loans or equity, and the
4 effective tax rate.
5 The final use value will be calculated using the soil
6 productivity indices and the agricultural use classification as
7 defined by rules promulgated by the State Board of Equalization.
8 This subsection shall not be construed in a manner which is
9 inconsistent with the duties, powers, and authority of the Board as
10 to valuation of the counties as fixed and defined by Section 21 of
11 Article X of the Oklahoma Constitution.
12 However, in calculating the use value of buffer strips as
13 defined in Section 2817.2 of this title, exclusive consideration
14 shall be based only on income from production agriculture from such
15 buffer strips, not including federal or state subsidies, when valued
16 as required by subsection C of Section 2817.2 of this title.
17 D. The use value of nonresidential improvements on agricultural
18 land shall be based on the cost approach to value estimation using
19 currently updated cost manuals published by the Marshall and Swift
20 Company or similar cost manuals approved by the Ad Valorem Division
21 of the Tax Commission. The use value estimates for the
22 nonresidential improvements shall take obsolescence and depreciation
23 into consideration in addition to necessary adjustments for local
24 variations in the cost of labor and materials. This section shall
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2140 Page 12

1 not be construed in a manner which is inconsistent with the duties,
2 powers, and authority of the Board as to equalization of valuation
3 of the counties as determined and defined by Section 21 of Article X
4 of the Oklahoma Constitution.
5 The use value of facilities used for poultry production shall be
6 determined according to the following procedures:
7 1. The Ad Valorem Division of the Tax Commission is hereby
8 directed to develop a standard system of valuation of both real and
9 personal property of such facilities, which shall be used by all
10 county assessors in this state, under which valuation based on the
11 following shall be presumed to be the fair cash value of the
12 property:
13 a. for real property, a ten-year depreciation schedule,
14 at the end of which the residual value is twenty
15 percent (20%) of the value of the facility during its
16 first year of operation, and
17 b. for personal property, a five-year depreciation
18 schedule, at the end of which the residual value is
19 zero;
20 2. Such facilities shall be valued only in comparison to other
21 facilities used exclusively for poultry production. Such a facility
22 which is no longer used for poultry production shall be deemed to
23 have no productive use;
24
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2140 Page 13

1 3. During the first year such a facility is placed on the tax
2 rolls, its fair cash value shall be presumed to be the lesser of the
3 actual purchase price or the actual documented cost of construction;
4 and
5 4. For the purpose of determining the valuation of
6 nonresidential improvements used for poultry production, the
7 provisions of this subsection shall be applicable and such
8 improvements shall not be considered to be commercial property.
9 E. The value of investment in property used exclusively by an
10 oil refinery that is used wholly as a facility, device, or method
11 for the desulphurization of gasoline or diesel fuel as defined in
12 Section 2817.3 of this title shall not be included in the
13 capitalization used in the determination of fair market value of
14 such oil refinery if such property would qualify as exempt property
15 pursuant to Section 2902 of this title, whether or not an
16 application for such exemption is made by an otherwise qualifying
17 manufacturing concern owning the property described by Section
18 2817.3 of this title.
19 F. The use value of a lot in any platted addition or a
20 subdivision in a city, town, or county zoned for residential,
21 commercial, industrial, or other use shall be deemed to be the fair
22 cash value of the underlying tract of land platted, divided by the
23 number of lots contained in the platted addition or subdivision
24 until the lot shall have been conveyed to a bona fide purchaser or
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2140 Page 14

1 the lot with building or buildings located thereon shall have been
2 occupied other than as a sales office by the owner thereof, or shall
3 have been leased, whichever event shall first occur. One who
4 purchases a lot for the purposes of constructing and selling a
5 building on such lot shall not be deemed to be a bona fide purchaser
6 for purposes of this section. However, if the lot is held for a
7 period longer than two (2) years before construction, then the
8 assessor may consider the lot to have been conveyed to a bona fide
9 purchaser. The cost of any land or improvements to any real
10 property required to be dedicated to public use including, but not
11 limited to, streets, curbs, gutters, sidewalks, storm or sanitary
12 sewers, utilities, detention or retention ponds, easements, parks,
13 or reserves shall not be utilized by the county assessor in the
14 valuation of any real property for assessment purposes.
15 G. The transfer of real property without a change in its use
16 classification shall not require a reassessment thereof based
17 exclusively upon the sale value of the property. However, if the
18 county assessor determines:
19 1. That by reason of the transfer of a property there is a
20 change in the actual use or classification of the property; or
21 2. That by reason of the amount of the sales consideration it
22 is obvious that the use classification prior to the transfer of the
23 property is not commensurate with and would not justify the amount
24 of the sales consideration of the property;
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2140 Page 15

1 then the assessor shall, in either event, reassess the property for
2 the new use classification for which the property is being used, or,
3 the highest and best use classification for which the property may,
4 by reason of the transfer, be classified for use.
5 H. When the term “fair cash value” or the language “fair cash
6 value, estimated at the price it would bring at a fair voluntary
7 sale” is used in the Ad Valorem Tax Code, in connection with and in
8 relation to the assessment of real property, it is defined to mean
9 and shall be given the meaning ascribed and assigned to it in this
10 section and when the term or language is used in the Code in
11 connection with the assessment of personal property, it shall be
12 given its ordinary or literal meaning.
13 I. Where any real property is zoned for a use by a proper
14 zoning authority, and the use of the property has not been changed,
15 the use and not zoning shall determine assessment. Any reassessment
16 required shall be effective January 1 following the change in use.
17 Taxable real property need not be listed annually with the county
18 assessor.
19 J. If any real property shall become taxable after January 1 of
20 any year, the county assessor shall assess the same and place it
21 upon the tax rolls for the next ensuing year. When any building is
22 constructed upon land after January 1 of any year, the value of the
23 building shall be added by the county assessor to the assessed
24 valuation of the land upon which the building is constructed at the
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2140 Page 16

1 fair cash value thereof for the next ensuing year. However, after
2 the building has been completed it shall be deemed to have a value
3 for assessment purposes of the fair cash value of the materials used
4 in such building only, until the building and the land on which the
5 building is located shall have been conveyed to a bona fide
6 purchaser or shall have been occupied or used for any purpose other
7 than as a sales office by the owner thereof, or shall have been
8 leased, whichever event shall first occur. The county assessor
9 shall continue to assess the building based upon the fair market
10 value of the materials used therein until the building and land upon
11 which the building is located shall have been conveyed to a bona
12 fide purchaser or is occupied or used for any purpose other than as
13 a sales office by the owner thereof, or is leased, whichever event
14 shall first occur. In the event a building or buildings described
15 by this subsection are intended to serve primarily as residential
16 rental housing, after the building or buildings have been completed
17 they shall be deemed to have an initial value for assessment
18 purposes not to exceed the fair cash value of the land and the
19 actual documented cost of any improvements made to the building or
20 buildings. The county assessor shall continue to assess such
21 building or buildings at a value not to exceed the fair cash value
22 of the land and actual documented cost of any improvements made
23 until either one (1) year has passed since the date on which the
24 building or buildings were first reflected on the tax rolls, or the
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2140 Page 17

1 buil ding or buildings and the land on which the building or
2 buildings are located shall have been conveyed to a bona fide
3 purchaser, whichever event shall first occur.
4 K. In the event improvements on land or personal property
5 located therein or thereon are destroyed or partially destroyed, or
6 the land itself is impaired or partially impaired by fire,
7 lightning, storm, winds, floodwaters, overflow of streams, or other
8 cause (all such destruction or impairments being referred to herein
9 as “damage”) during any year, the county assessor shall determine
10 the amount of damage and shall reassess the property for that year
11 at the fair cash value of the property, taking into account the
12 actual loss of functional use of the property occasioned by such
13 damage. The assessor shall make the appropriate value adjustments
14 to the property for that tax year up to the time at which the
15 assessor publishes the “Assessor’s assessor’s Report to the Excise
16 Board” Board as required by subsection D of Section 2867 of this
17 title. After such time, adjustments can be made only by the county
18 board of tax roll corrections and only after the assessor has
19 certified the tax roll for that year. The board secretary shall
20 notify property owners in advance of the time and place at which the
21 value adjustment to their property will be heard by the board. The
22 board of tax roll corrections is authorized only to approve or
23 reject the value adjustment submitted by the county assessor.

2 oil, natural gas, or other minerals including drilling equipment and
3 rigs, shall be assessed annually at the value set forth in the first
4 Hadco International monthly bulletin published for the tax year,
5 using the appropriate depth rating assigned to the drawworks by its
6 manufacturer and the actual condition of the rig.
7 M. The value of taxable tangible personal property used in
8 commercial disposal systems of waste materials from the production
9 of oil and gas shall not include any contract rights or leases for
10 the use of such systems nor any value associated with the wellbore
11 or non-recoverable down-hole material including casing.
