HB2140 HFLR Page 9
BOLD FACE denotes Committee Amendments.

11 be p resumed to constitute the fair cash value of the personal
22 property.
33 Stocks of goods, wares, and merchandise shall be assessed at the
44 value of the average amount on hand during the preceding year, or
55 the average amount on hand during the part of the preceding year the
66 stock of goods, wares, or merchandise was at its January 1 location.
77 Provided, persons primarily engaged in selling lumber and other

1133 of the same year.
1144 B. All taxable real property shall be assessed annually as of
1155 January 1, at its fair cash value, estimated at the price it would
1166 bring at a fair voluntary sale for:
1177 1. The highest and best use for which the property was actually
1188 used during the preceding calendar year; or
1199 2. The highest and best use for which the property was last

2244
HB2140 HFLR Page 10
BOLD FACE denotes Committee Amendments.

11 asse ssed in the taxing jurisdiction in which the physical majority
22 of those improvements are located.
33 The Ad Valorem Division of the Oklahoma Tax Commission shall be
44 responsible for the promulgation of rules which shall be followed by
55 each county assessor of the state, for the purposes of providing for
66 the equitable use valuation of locally assessed real property in
77 this state. Agricultural land and nonresidential improvements
88 necessary or convenient for agricultural purposes shall be assessed
99 for ad valorem taxation based upon the highest and best use for
1100 which the property was actually used, or was previously classified
1111 for use, during the calendar year next preceding January 1 on which
1122 the assessment is made.
1133 C. The use value of agricultural land shall be based on the
1144 income capitalization approach using cash rent. The rental income
1155 shall be calculated using the direct capitalization method based

1188 Natural Resources Conservation Service of the United States
1199 Department of Agriculture;
2200 2. Soil productivity indices approved by the Ad Valorem

2244 Commission; and
HB2140 HFLR Page 11
BOLD FACE denotes Committee Amendments.

11 4. A capitalization rate to be determined annually by the Ad
22 Valorem Division of the Tax Commission based on the sum of the
33 average first mortgage interest rate charged by the Federal Land
44 Bank for the immediately preceding five (5) years, weighted with the
55 prevailing rate or rates for additional loans or equity, and the
66 effective tax rate.
77 The final use value will be calculated using the soil
88 productivity indices and the agricultural use classification as
99 defined by rules promulgated by the State Board of Equalization.
1100 This subsection shall not be construed in a manner which is
1111 inconsistent with the duties, powers, and authority of the Board as
1122 to valuation of the counties as fixed and defined by Section 21 of
1133 Article X of the Oklahoma Constitution.
1144 However, in calculating the use value of buffer strips as
1155 defined in Section 2817.2 of this title, exclusive consideration
1166 shall be based only on income from production agriculture from such
1177 buffer strips, not including federal or state subsidies, when valued
1188 as required by subsection C of Section 2817.2 of this title.
1199 D. The use value of nonresidential improvements on agricultural
2200 land shall be based on the cost approach to value estimation using
2211 currently updated cost manuals published by the Marshall and Swift
2222 Company or similar cost manuals approved by the Ad Valorem Division
2233 of the Tax Commission. The use value estimates for the
2244 nonresidential improvements shall take obsolescence and depreciation
HB2140 HFLR Page 12
BOLD FACE denotes Committee Amendments.

11 into consideration in addition to necessary adjustments for local
22 variations in the cost of labor and materials. This section shall
33 not be construed in a manner which is inconsistent with the duties,
44 powers, and authority of the Board as to equalization of valuation
55 of the counties as determined and defined by Section 21 of Article X
66 of the Oklahoma Constitution.
77 The use value of facilities used for poultry production shall be
88 determined according to the following procedures:
99 1. The Ad Valorem Division of the Tax Commission is hereby
1100 directed to develop a standard system of valuation of both real and
1111 personal property of such facilities, which shall be used by all
1122 county assessors in this state, under which valuation based on the
1133 following shall be presumed to be the fair cash value of the
1144 property:
1155 a. for real property, a ten-year depreciation schedule,
1166 at the end of which the residual value is twenty
1177 percent (20%) of the value of the facility during its
1188 first year of operation, and
1199 b. for personal property, a five-year depreciation
2200 schedule, at the end of which the residual value is
2211 zero;
2222 2. Such facilities shall be valued only in comparison to other
2233 facilities used exclusively for poultry production. Such a facility
2244
HB2140 HFLR Page 13
BOLD FACE denotes Committee Amendments.

11 whic h is no longer used for poultry production shall be deemed to
22 have no productive use;
33 3. During the first year such a facility is placed on the tax
44 rolls, its fair cash value shall be presumed to be the lesser of the
55 actual purchase price or the actual documented cost of construction;
66 and
77 4. For the purpose of determining the valuation of
88 nonresidential improvements used for poultry production, the
99 provisions of this subsection shall be applicable and such
1100 improvements shall not be considered to be commercial property.
1111 E. The value of investment in property used exclusively by an
1122 oil refinery that is used wholly as a facility, device, or method
1133 for the desulphurization of gasoline or diesel fuel as defined in
1144 Section 2817.3 of this title shall not be included in the
1155 capitalization used in the determination of fair market value of
1166 such oil refinery if such property would qualify as exempt property
1177 pursuant to Section 2902 of this title, whether or not an
1188 application for such exemption is made by an otherwise qualifying
1199 manufacturing concern owning the property described by Section
2200 2817.3 of this title.
2211 F. The use value of a lot in any platted addition or a
2222 subdivision in a city, town, or county zoned for residential,
2233 commercial, industrial, or other use shall be deemed to be the fair
2244 cash value of the underlying tract of land platted, divided by the
HB2140 HFLR Page 14
BOLD FACE denotes Committee Amendments.

11 numb er of lots contained in the platted addition or subdivision
22 until the lot shall have been conveyed to a bona fide purchaser or
33 the lot with building or buildings located thereon shall have been
44 occupied other than as a sales office by the owner thereof, or shall
55 have been leased, whichever event shall first occur. One who
66 purchases a lot for the purposes of constructing and selling a
77 building on such lot shall not be deemed to be a bona fide purchaser
88 for purposes of this section. However, if the lot is held for a
99 period longer than two (2) years before construction, then the
1100 assessor may consider the lot to have been conveyed to a bona fide
1111 purchaser. The cost of any land or improvements to any real
1122 property required to be dedicated to public use including, but not
1133 limited to, streets, curbs, gutters, sidewalks, storm or sanitary
1144 sewers, utilities, detention or retention ponds, easements, parks,
1155 or reserves shall not be utilized by the county assessor in the
1166 valuation of any real property for assessment purposes.
1177 G. The transfer of real property without a change in its use
1188 classification shall not require a reassessment thereof based
1199 exclusively upon the sale value of the property. However, if the
2200 county assessor determines:
2211 1. That by reason of the transfer of a property there is a
2222 change in the actual use or classification of the property; or
2233 2. That by reason of the amount of the sales consideration it
2244 is obvious that the use classification prior to the transfer of the
HB2140 HFLR Page 15
BOLD FACE denotes Committee Amendments.

11 prop erty is not commensurate with and would not justify the amount
22 of the sales consideration of the property;
33 then the assessor shall, in either event, reassess the property for
44 the new use classification for which the property is being used, or,
55 the highest and best use classification for which the property may,
66 by reason of the transfer, be classified for use.
77 H. When the term “fair cash value” or the language “fair cash
88 value, estimated at the price it would bring at a fair voluntary
99 sale” is used in the Ad Valorem Tax Code, in connection with and in
1100 relation to the assessment of real property, it is defined to mean
1111 and shall be given the meaning ascribed and assigned to it in this
1122 section and when the term or language is used in the Code in
1133 connection with the assessment of personal property, it shall be
1144 given its ordinary or literal meaning.
1155 I. Where any real property is zoned for a use by a proper
1166 zoning authority, and the use of the property has not been changed,
1177 the use and not zoning shall determine assessment. Any reassessment
1188 required shall be effective January 1 following the change in use.
1199 Taxable real property need not be listed annually with the county
2200 assessor.
2211 J. If any real property shall become taxable after January 1 of
2222 any year, the county assessor shall assess the same and place it
2233 upon the tax rolls for the next ensuing year. When any building is
2244 constructed upon land after January 1 of any year, the value of the
HB2140 HFLR Page 16
BOLD FACE denotes Committee Amendments.

11 buil ding shall be added by the county assessor to the assessed
22 valuation of the land upon which the building is constructed at the
33 fair cash value thereof for the next ensuing year. However, after
44 the building has been completed it shall be deemed to have a value
55 for assessment purposes of the fair cash value of the materials used
66 in such building only, until the building and the land on which the
77 building is located shall have been conveyed to a bona fide
88 purchaser or shall have been occupied or used for any purpose other
99 than as a sales office by the owner thereof, or shall have been
1100 leased, whichever event shall first occur. The county assessor
1111 shall continue to assess the building based upon the fair market
1122 value of the materials used therein until the building and land upon
1133 which the building is located shall have been conveyed to a bona
1144 fide purchaser or is occupied or used for any purpose other than as
1155 a sales office by the owner thereof, or is leased, whichever event
1166 shall first occur. In the event a building or buildings described
1177 by this subsection are intended to serve primarily as residential
1188 rental housing, after the building or buildings have been completed
1199 they shall be deemed to have an initial value for assessment
2200 purposes not to exceed the fair cash value of the land and the
2211 actual documented cost of any improvements made to the building or
2222 buildings. The county assessor shall continue to assess such
2233 building or buildings at a value not to exceed the fair cash value
2244 of the land and actual documented cost of any improvements made
HB2140 HFLR Page 17
BOLD FACE denotes Committee Amendments.

11 unti l either two (2) years have passed since the date on which the
22 building or buildings were first reflected on the tax rolls, or the
33 building or buildings and the land on which the building or
44 buildings are located shall have been conveyed to a bona fide
55 purchaser, whichever event shall first occur.
66 K. In the event improvements on land or personal property
77 located therein or thereon are destroyed or partially destroyed, or
88 the land itself is impaired or partially impaired by fire,
99 lightning, storm, winds, floodwaters, overflow of streams, or other
1100 cause (all such destruction or impairments being referred to herein
1111 as “damage”) during any year, the county assessor shall determine
1122 the amount of damage and shall reassess the property for that year
1133 at the fair cash value of the property, taking into account the
1144 actual loss of functional use of the property occasioned by such
1155 damage. The assessor shall make the appropriate value adjustments
1166 to the property for that tax year up to the time at which the
1177 assessor publishes the “Assessor’s assessor’s Report to the Excise
1188 Board” Board as required by subsection D of Section 2867 of this
1199 title. After such time, adjustments can be made only by the county
2200 board of tax roll corrections and only after the assessor has
2211 certified the tax roll for that year. The board secretary shall
2222 notify property owners in advance of the time and place at which the
2233 value adjustment to their property will be heard by the board. The
2244
HB2140 HFLR Page 18
