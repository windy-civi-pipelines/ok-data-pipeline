Req. No. 13367 Page 9
11 Stocks of goods, wares, and merchandise shall be assessed at the
22 value of the average amount on hand during the preceding year, or

44 stock of goods, wares, or merchandise was at its January 1 location.
55 Provided, persons primarily engaged in selling lumber and other

77 centers classified under Industry No. 444110 of the North American

1111 of the same year.
1122 B. All taxable real property shall be assessed annually as of
1133 January 1, at its fair cash value, estimated at the price it would
1144 bring at a fair voluntary sale for:
1155 1. The highest and best use for which the property was actually
1166 used during the preceding calendar year; or
1177 2. The highest and best use for which the property was last

2211 a taxing jurisdiction line, those improvements shall be valued and
2222 assessed in the taxing jurisdiction in which the physical majority
2233 of those improvements are located.
2244
Req. No. 13367 Page 10
11 The Ad Valorem Division of the Oklahoma Tax Commission shall be
22 responsible for the promulgation of rules which shall be followed by
33 each county assessor of the state, for the purposes of providing for
44 the equitable use valuation of locally assessed real property in
55 this state. Agricultural land and nonresidential improvements
66 necessary or convenient for agricultural purposes shall be assessed
77 for ad valorem taxation based upon the highest and best use for
88 which the property was actually used, or was previously classified
99 for use, during the calendar year next preceding January 1 on which
1100 the assessment is made.
1111 C. The use value of agricultural land shall be based on the
1122 income capitalization approach using cash rent. The rental income
1133 shall be calculated using the direct capitalization method based
1144 upon factors including, but not limited to:
1155 1. Soil types, as depicted on soil maps published by the
1166 Natural Resources Conservation Service of the United States
1177 Department of Agriculture;
1188 2. Soil productivity indices approved by the Ad Valorem
1199 Division of the Tax Commission;
2200 3. The specific agricultural purpose of the soil based on use
2211 categories approved by the Ad Valorem Division of the Tax
2222 Commission; and
2233 4. A capitalization rate to be determined annually by the Ad
2244 Valorem Division of the Tax Commission based on the sum of the
Req. No. 13367 Page 11
11 aver age first mortgage interest rate charged by the Federal Land
22 Bank for the immediately preceding five (5) years, weighted with the
33 prevailing rate or rates for additional loans or equity, and the
44 effective tax rate.
55 The final use value will be calculated using the soil
66 productivity indices and the agricultural use classification as
77 defined by rules promulgated by the State Board of Equalization.
88 This subsection shall not be construed in a manner which is
99 inconsistent with the duties, powers, and authority of the Board as
1100 to valuation of the counties as fixed and defined by Section 21 of
1111 Article X of the Oklahoma Constitution.
1122 However, in calculating the use value of buffer strips as
1133 defined in Section 2817.2 of this title, exclusive consideration
1144 shall be based only on income from production agriculture from such
1155 buffer strips, not including federal or state subsidies, when valued
1166 as required by subsection C of Section 2817.2 of this title.
1177 D. The use value of nonresidential improvements on agricultural
1188 land shall be based on the cost approach to value estimation using
1199 currently updated cost manuals published by the Marshall and Swift
2200 Company or similar cost manuals approved by the Ad Valorem Division
2211 of the Tax Commission. The use value estimates for the
2222 nonresidential improvements shall take obsolescence and depreciation
2233 into consideration in addition to necessary adjustments for local
2244 variations in the cost of labor and materials. This section shall
Req. No. 13367 Page 12
11 not be construed in a manner which is inconsistent with the duties,
22 powers, and authority of the Board as to equalization of valuation
33 of the counties as determined and defined by Section 21 of Article X
44 of the Oklahoma Constitution.
55 The use value of facilities used for poultry production shall be
66 determined according to the following procedures:
77 1. The Ad Valorem Division of the Tax Commission is hereby
88 directed to develop a standard system of valuation of both real and
99 personal property of such facilities, which shall be used by all
1100 county assessors in this state, under which valuation based on the
1111 following shall be presumed to be the fair cash value of the
1122 property:
1133 a. for real property, a ten-year depreciation schedule,
1144 at the end of which the residual value is twenty
1155 percent (20%) of the value of the facility during its
1166 first year of operation, and
1177 b. for personal property, a five-year depreciation
1188 schedule, at the end of which the residual value is
1199 zero;
2200 2. Such facilities shall be valued only in comparison to other
2211 facilities used exclusively for poultry production. Such a facility
2222 which is no longer used for poultry production shall be deemed to
2233 have no productive use;
2244
Req. No. 13367 Page 13
11 3. During the first year such a facility is placed on the tax
22 rolls, its fair cash value shall be presumed to be the lesser of the
33 actual purchase price or the actual documented cost of construction;
44 and
55 4. For the purpose of determining the valuation of
66 nonresidential improvements used for poultry production, the
77 provisions of this subsection shall be applicable and such
88 improvements shall not be considered to be commercial property.
99 E. The value of investment in property used exclusively by an
1100 oil refinery that is used wholly as a facility, device, or method
1111 for the desulphurization of gasoline or diesel fuel as defined in
1122 Section 2817.3 of this title shall not be included in the
1133 capitalization used in the determination of fair market value of
1144 such oil refinery if such property would qualify as exempt property
1155 pursuant to Section 2902 of this title, whether or not an
1166 application for such exemption is made by an otherwise qualifying
1177 manufacturing concern owning the property described by Section
1188 2817.3 of this title.
1199 F. The use value of a lot in any platted addition or a
2200 subdivision in a city, town, or county zoned for residential,
2211 commercial, industrial, or other use shall be deemed to be the fair
2222 cash value of the underlying tract of land platted, divided by the
2233 number of lots contained in the platted addition or subdivision
2244 until the lot shall have been conveyed to a bona fide purchaser or
Req. No. 13367 Page 14
11 the lot with building or buildings located thereon shall have been
22 occupied other than as a sales office by the owner thereof, or shall
33 have been leased, whichever event shall first occur. One who
44 purchases a lot for the purposes of constructing and selling a
55 building on such lot shall not be deemed to be a bona fide purchaser
66 for purposes of this section. However, if the lot is held for a
77 period longer than two (2) years before construction, then the
88 assessor may consider the lot to have been conveyed to a bona fide
99 purchaser. The cost of any land or improvements to any real
1100 property required to be dedicated to public use including, but not
1111 limited to, streets, curbs, gutters, sidewalks, storm or sanitary
1122 sewers, utilities, detention or retention ponds, easements, parks,
1133 or reserves shall not be utilized by the county assessor in the
1144 valuation of any real property for assessment purposes.
1155 G. The transfer of real property without a change in its use
1166 classification shall not require a reassessment thereof based
1177 exclusively upon the sale value of the property. However, if the
1188 county assessor determines:
1199 1. That by reason of the transfer of a property there is a
2200 change in the actual use or classification of the property; or
2211 2. That by reason of the amount of the sales consideration it
2222 is obvious that the use classification prior to the transfer of the
2233 property is not commensurate with and would not justify the amount
2244 of the sales consideration of the property;
Req. No. 13367 Page 15
11 then the assessor shall, in either event, reassess the property for
22 the new use classification for which the property is being used, or,
33 the highest and best use classification for which the property may,
44 by reason of the transfer, be classified for use.
55 H. When the term “fair cash value” or the language “fair cash
66 value, estimated at the price it would bring at a fair voluntary
77 sale” is used in the Ad Valorem Tax Code, in connection with and in
88 relation to the assessment of real property, it is defined to mean
99 and shall be given the meaning ascribed and assigned to it in this
1100 section and when the term or language is used in the Code in
1111 connection with the assessment of personal property, it shall be
1122 given its ordinary or literal meaning.
1133 I. Where any real property is zoned for a use by a proper
1144 zoning authority, and the use of the property has not been changed,
1155 the use and not zoning shall determine assessment. Any reassessment
1166 required shall be effective January 1 following the change in use.
1177 Taxable real property need not be listed annually with the county
1188 assessor.
1199 J. If any real property shall become taxable after January 1 of
2200 any year, the county assessor shall assess the same and place it
2211 upon the tax rolls for the next ensuing year. When any building is
2222 constructed upon land after January 1 of any year, the value of the
2233 building shall be added by the county assessor to the assessed
2244 valuation of the land upon which the building is constructed at the
Req. No. 13367 Page 16
11 fair cash value thereof for the next ensuing year. However, after
22 the building has been completed it shall be deemed to have a value
33 for assessment purposes of the fair cash value of the materials used
44 in such building only, until the building and the land on which the
55 building is located shall have been conveyed to a bona fide
66 purchaser or shall have been occupied or used for any purpose other
77 than as a sales office by the owner thereof, or shall have been
88 leased, whichever event shall first occur. The county assessor
99 shall continue to assess the building based upon the fair market
1100 value of the materials used therein until the building and land upon
1111 which the building is located shall have been conveyed to a bona
1122 fide purchaser or is occupied or used for any purpose other than as
1133 a sales office by the owner thereof, or is leased, whichever event
1144 shall first occur. In the event a building or buildings described
1155 by this subsection are intended to serve primarily as residential
1166 rental housing, after the building or buildings have been completed
1177 they shall be deemed to have an initial value for assessment
1188 purposes not to exceed the fair cash value of the land and the
1199 actual documented cost of any improvements made to the building or
2200 buildings. The county assessor shall continue to assess such
2211 building or buildings at a value not to exceed the fair cash value
2222 of the land and actual documented cost of any improvements made
2233 until either one (1) year has passed since the date on which the
2244 building or buildings were first reflected on the tax rolls, or the
Req. No. 13367 Page 17
11 buil ding or buildings and the land on which the building or
22 buildings are located shall have been conveyed to a bona fide
33 purchaser, whichever event shall first occur.
44 K. In the event improvements on land or personal property
55 located therein or thereon are destroyed or partially destroyed, or
66 the land itself is impaired or partially impaired by fire,
77 lightning, storm, winds, floodwaters, overflow of streams, or other
88 cause (all such destruction or impairments being referred to herein
99 as “damage”) during any year, the county assessor shall determine
1100 the amount of damage and shall reassess the property for that year
1111 at the fair cash value of the property, taking into account the
1122 actual loss of functional use of the property occasioned by such
1133 damage. The assessor shall make the appropriate value adjustments
1144 to the property for that tax year up to the time at which the
1155 assessor publishes the “Assessor’s assessor’s Report to the Excise
1166 Board” Board as required by subsection D of Section 2867 of this
1177 title. After such time, adjustments can be made only by the county
1188 board of tax roll corrections and only after the assessor has
1199 certified the tax roll for that year. The board secretary shall
2200 notify property owners in advance of the time and place at which the
2211 value adjustment to their property will be heard by the board. The
2222 board of tax roll corrections is authorized only to approve or
2233 reject the value adjustment submitted by the county assessor.

Req. No. 13367 Page 9

11 Stocks of goods, wares, and merchandise shall be assessed at the
22 value of the average amount on hand during the preceding year, or

1155 1. The highest and best use for which the property was actually

2244
Req. No. 13367 Page 10

11 The Ad Valorem Division of the Oklahoma Tax Commission shall be
22 responsible for the promulgation of rules which shall be followed by
33 each county assessor of the state, for the purposes of providing for
44 the equitable use valuation of locally assessed real property in
55 this state. Agricultural land and nonresidential improvements
66 necessary or convenient for agricultural purposes shall be assessed
77 for ad valorem taxation based upon the highest and best use for
88 which the property was actually used, or was previously classified
99 for use, during the calendar year next preceding January 1 on which
1100 the assessment is made.
1111 C. The use value of agricultural land shall be based on the
1122 income capitalization approach using cash rent. The rental income
1133 shall be calculated using the direct capitalization method based
1144 upon factors including, but not limited to:
1155 1. Soil types, as depicted on soil maps published by the
1166 Natural Resources Conservation Service of the United States
1177 Department of Agriculture;
1188 2. Soil productivity indices approved by the Ad Valorem
1199 Division of the Tax Commission;
2200 3. The specific agricultural purpose of the soil based on use
2211 categories approved by the Ad Valorem Division of the Tax
2222 Commission; and
2233 4. A capitalization rate to be determined annually by the Ad
2244 Valorem Division of the Tax Commission based on the sum of the
Req. No. 13367 Page 11

11 aver age first mortgage interest rate charged by the Federal Land
22 Bank for the immediately preceding five (5) years, weighted with the
33 prevailing rate or rates for additional loans or equity, and the
44 effective tax rate.
55 The final use value will be calculated using the soil
66 productivity indices and the agricultural use classification as
77 defined by rules promulgated by the State Board of Equalization.
88 This subsection shall not be construed in a manner which is
99 inconsistent with the duties, powers, and authority of the Board as
1100 to valuation of the counties as fixed and defined by Section 21 of
1111 Article X of the Oklahoma Constitution.
1122 However, in calculating the use value of buffer strips as
1133 defined in Section 2817.2 of this title, exclusive consideration
1144 shall be based only on income from production agriculture from such
1155 buffer strips, not including federal or state subsidies, when valued
1166 as required by subsection C of Section 2817.2 of this title.
1177 D. The use value of nonresidential improvements on agricultural
1188 land shall be based on the cost approach to value estimation using
1199 currently updated cost manuals published by the Marshall and Swift
2200 Company or similar cost manuals approved by the Ad Valorem Division
2211 of the Tax Commission. The use value estimates for the
2222 nonresidential improvements shall take obsolescence and depreciation
2233 into consideration in addition to necessary adjustments for local
2244 variations in the cost of labor and materials. This section shall
Req. No. 13367 Page 12

11 not be construed in a manner which is inconsistent with the duties,
22 powers, and authority of the Board as to equalization of valuation
33 of the counties as determined and defined by Section 21 of Article X
44 of the Oklahoma Constitution.
55 The use value of facilities used for poultry production shall be
66 determined according to the following procedures:
77 1. The Ad Valorem Division of the Tax Commission is hereby
88 directed to develop a standard system of valuation of both real and
99 personal property of such facilities, which shall be used by all
1100 county assessors in this state, under which valuation based on the
1111 following shall be presumed to be the fair cash value of the
1122 property:
1133 a. for real property, a ten-year depreciation schedule,
1144 at the end of which the residual value is twenty
1155 percent (20%) of the value of the facility during its
1166 first year of operation, and
1177 b. for personal property, a five-year depreciation
1188 schedule, at the end of which the residual value is
1199 zero;
2200 2. Such facilities shall be valued only in comparison to other
2211 facilities used exclusively for poultry production. Such a facility
2222 which is no longer used for poultry production shall be deemed to
2233 have no productive use;
2244
Req. No. 13367 Page 13

11 3. During the first year such a facility is placed on the tax
22 rolls, its fair cash value shall be presumed to be the lesser of the
33 actual purchase price or the actual documented cost of construction;
44 and
55 4. For the purpose of determining the valuation of
66 nonresidential improvements used for poultry production, the
77 provisions of this subsection shall be applicable and such
88 improvements shall not be considered to be commercial property.
99 E. The value of investment in property used exclusively by an
1100 oil refinery that is used wholly as a facility, device, or method
1111 for the desulphurization of gasoline or diesel fuel as defined in
1122 Section 2817.3 of this title shall not be included in the
1133 capitalization used in the determination of fair market value of
1144 such oil refinery if such property would qualify as exempt property
1155 pursuant to Section 2902 of this title, whether or not an
1166 application for such exemption is made by an otherwise qualifying
1177 manufacturing concern owning the property described by Section
1188 2817.3 of this title.
1199 F. The use value of a lot in any platted addition or a
2200 subdivision in a city, town, or county zoned for residential,
2211 commercial, industrial, or other use shall be deemed to be the fair
2222 cash value of the underlying tract of land platted, divided by the
2233 number of lots contained in the platted addition or subdivision
2244 until the lot shall have been conveyed to a bona fide purchaser or
Req. No. 13367 Page 14

11 the lot with building or buildings located thereon shall have been
22 occupied other than as a sales office by the owner thereof, or shall
33 have been leased, whichever event shall first occur. One who
44 purchases a lot for the purposes of constructing and selling a
55 building on such lot shall not be deemed to be a bona fide purchaser
66 for purposes of this section. However, if the lot is held for a
77 period longer than two (2) years before construction, then the
88 assessor may consider the lot to have been conveyed to a bona fide
99 purchaser. The cost of any land or improvements to any real
1100 property required to be dedicated to public use including, but not
1111 limited to, streets, curbs, gutters, sidewalks, storm or sanitary
1122 sewers, utilities, detention or retention ponds, easements, parks,
1133 or reserves shall not be utilized by the county assessor in the
1144 valuation of any real property for assessment purposes.
1155 G. The transfer of real property without a change in its use
1166 classification shall not require a reassessment thereof based
1177 exclusively upon the sale value of the property. However, if the
1188 county assessor determines:
1199 1. That by reason of the transfer of a property there is a
2200 change in the actual use or classification of the property; or
2211 2. That by reason of the amount of the sales consideration it
2222 is obvious that the use classification prior to the transfer of the
2233 property is not commensurate with and would not justify the amount
2244 of the sales consideration of the property;
Req. No. 13367 Page 15

11 then the assessor shall, in either event, reassess the property for
22 the new use classification for which the property is being used, or,
33 the highest and best use classification for which the property may,
44 by reason of the transfer, be classified for use.
55 H. When the term “fair cash value” or the language “fair cash
66 value, estimated at the price it would bring at a fair voluntary
77 sale” is used in the Ad Valorem Tax Code, in connection with and in
88 relation to the assessment of real property, it is defined to mean
99 and shall be given the meaning ascribed and assigned to it in this
1100 section and when the term or language is used in the Code in
1111 connection with the assessment of personal property, it shall be
1122 given its ordinary or literal meaning.
1133 I. Where any real property is zoned for a use by a proper
1144 zoning authority, and the use of the property has not been changed,
1155 the use and not zoning shall determine assessment. Any reassessment
1166 required shall be effective January 1 following the change in use.
1177 Taxable real property need not be listed annually with the county
1188 assessor.
1199 J. If any real property shall become taxable after January 1 of
2200 any year, the county assessor shall assess the same and place it
2211 upon the tax rolls for the next ensuing year. When any building is
2222 constructed upon land after January 1 of any year, the value of the
2233 building shall be added by the county assessor to the assessed
2244 valuation of the land upon which the building is constructed at the
Req. No. 13367 Page 16

11 fair cash value thereof for the next ensuing year. However, after
22 the building has been completed it shall be deemed to have a value
33 for assessment purposes of the fair cash value of the materials used
44 in such building only, until the building and the land on which the
55 building is located shall have been conveyed to a bona fide
66 purchaser or shall have been occupied or used for any purpose other
77 than as a sales office by the owner thereof, or shall have been
88 leased, whichever event shall first occur. The county assessor
99 shall continue to assess the building based upon the fair market
1100 value of the materials used therein until the building and land upon
1111 which the building is located shall have been conveyed to a bona
1122 fide purchaser or is occupied or used for any purpose other than as
1133 a sales office by the owner thereof, or is leased, whichever event
1144 shall first occur. In the event a building or buildings described
1155 by this subsection are intended to serve primarily as residential
1166 rental housing, after the building or buildings have been completed
1177 they shall be deemed to have an initial value for assessment
1188 purposes not to exceed the fair cash value of the land and the
1199 actual documented cost of any improvements made to the building or
2200 buildings. The county assessor shall continue to assess such
2211 building or buildings at a value not to exceed the fair cash value
2222 of the land and actual documented cost of any improvements made
2233 until either one (1) year has passed since the date on which the
2244 building or buildings were first reflected on the tax rolls, or the
