99 of the same year.
1100 B. All taxable real property shall be assessed annually as of
1111 January 1, at its fair cash value, estimated at the price it would
1122 bring at a fair voluntary sale for:
1133 1. The highest and best use for which the property was actually
1144 used during the preceding calendar year; or
1155 2. The highest and best use for which the property was last
1166 classified for use if not actually used during the preceding
1177 calendar year.
1188 When improvements upon residential real property are divided by
1199 a taxing jurisdiction line, those improvements shall be valued and
2200 assessed in the taxing jurisdiction in which the physical majority
2211 of those improvements are located.
2222 The Ad Valorem Division of the Oklahoma Tax Commission shall be
2233 responsible for the promulgation of rules which shall be followed by
2244 each county assessor of the state, for the purposes of providing for
Req. No. 13166 Page 10

11 the equitable use valuation of locally assessed real property in
22 this state. Agricultural land and nonresidential improvements
33 necessary or convenient for agricultural purposes shall be assessed
44 for ad valorem taxation based upon the highest and best use for

77 the assessment is made.
88 C. The use value of agricultural land shall be based on the
99 income capitalization approach using cash rent. The rental income
1100 shall be calculated using the direct capitalization method based
1111 upon factors including, but not limited to:
1122 1. Soil types, as depicted on soil maps published by the
1133 Natural Resources Conservation Service of the United States
1144 Department of Agriculture;

1188 categories approved by the Ad Valorem Division of the Tax
1199 Commission; and

2222 average first mortgage interest rate charged by the Federal Land
2233 Bank for the immediately preceding five (5) years, weighted with the
2244
Req. No. 13166 Page 11

11 prev ailing rate or rates for additional loans or equity, and the
22 effective tax rate.
33 The final use value will be calculated using the soil
44 productivity indices and the agricultural use classification as
55 defined by rules promulgated by the State Board of Equalization.
66 This subsection shall not be construed in a manner which is
77 inconsistent with the duties, powers, and authority of the Board as
88 to valuation of the counties as fixed and defined by Section 21 of
99 Article X of the Oklahoma Constitution.
1100 However, in calculating the use value of buffer strips as
1111 defined in Section 2817.2 of this title, exclusive consideration

1144 as required by subsection C of Section 2817.2 of this title.
1155 D. The use value of nonresidential improvements on agricultural
1166 land shall be based on the cost approach to value estimation using
1177 currently updated cost manuals published by the Marshall and Swift
1188 Company or similar cost manuals approved by the Ad Valorem Division
1199 of the Tax Commission. The use value estimates for the
2200 nonresidential improvements shall take obsolescence and depreciation
2211 into consideration in addition to necessary adjustments for local
2222 variations in the cost of labor and materials. This section shall
2233 not be construed in a manner which is inconsistent with the duties,
2244 powers, and authority of the Board as to equalization of valuation
Req. No. 13166 Page 12

11 of t he counties as determined and defined by Section 21 of Article X

33 The use value of facilities used for poultry production shall be
44 determined according to the following procedures:
55 1. The Ad Valorem Division of the Tax Commission is hereby
66 directed to develop a standard system of valuation of both real and
77 personal property of such facilities, which shall be used by all
88 county assessors in this state, under which valuation based on the
99 following shall be presumed to be the fair cash value of the
1100 property:
1111 a. for real property, a ten-year depreciation schedule,
1122 at the end of which the residual value is twenty
1133 percent (20%) of the value of the facility during its
1144 first year of operation, and
1155 b. for personal property, a five-year depreciation
1166 schedule, at the end of which the residual value is
1177 zero;
1188 2. Such facilities shall be valued only in comparison to other
1199 facilities used exclusively for poultry production. Such a facility
2200 which is no longer used for poultry production shall be deemed to
2211 have no productive use;
2222 3. During the first year such a facility is placed on the tax
2233 rolls, its fair cash value shall be presumed to be the lesser of the
2244
Req. No. 13166 Page 13

11 actu al purchase price or the actual documented cost of construction;
22 and
33 4. For the purpose of determining the valuation of
44 nonresidential improvements used for poultry production, the
55 provisions of this subsection shall be applicable and such
66 improvements shall not be considered to be commercial property.
77 E. The value of investment in property used exclusively by an
88 oil refinery that is used wholly as a facility, device, or method
99 for the desulphurization of gasoline or diesel fuel as defined in
1100 Section 2817.3 of this title shall not be included in the
1111 capitalization used in the determination of fair market value of
1122 such oil refinery if such property would qualify as exempt property
1133 pursuant to Section 2902 of this title, whether or not an
1144 application for such exemption is made by an otherwise qualifying
1155 manufacturing concern owning the property described by Section
1166 2817.3 of this title.
1177 F. The use value of a lot in any platted addition or a
1188 subdivision in a city, town, or county zoned for residential,
1199 commercial, industrial, or other use shall be deemed to be the fair
2200 cash value of the underlying tract of land platted, divided by the
2211 number of lots contained in the platted addition or subdivision
2222 until the lot shall have been conveyed to a bona fide purchaser or
2233 the lot with building or buildings located thereon shall have been
2244 occupied other than as a sales office by the owner thereof, or shall
Req. No. 13166 Page 14

11 have been leased, whichever event shall first occur. One who
22 purchases a lot for the purposes of constructing and selling a
33 building on such lot shall not be deemed to be a bona fide purchaser
44 for purposes of this section. However, if the lot is held for a
55 period longer than two (2) years before construction, then the
66 assessor may consider the lot to have been conveyed to a bona fide
77 purchaser. The cost of any land or improvements to any real
88 property required to be dedicated to public use including, but not
99 limited to, streets, curbs, gutters, sidewalks, storm or sanitary
1100 sewers, utilities, detention or retention ponds, easements, parks,
1111 or reserves shall not be utilized by the county assessor in the
1122 valuation of any real property for assessment purposes.
1133 G. The transfer of real property without a change in its use
1144 classification shall not require a reassessment thereof based
1155 exclusively upon the sale value of the property. However, if the
1166 county assessor determines:
1177 1. That by reason of the transfer of a property there is a
1188 change in the actual use or classification of the property; or
1199 2. That by reason of the amount of the sales consideration it
2200 is obvious that the use classification prior to the transfer of the
2211 property is not commensurate with and would not justify the amount
2222 of the sales consideration of the property;
2233 then the assessor shall, in either event, reassess the property for
2244 the new use classification for which the property is being used, or,
Req. No. 13166 Page 15

11 the highest and best use classification for which the property may,
22 by reason of the transfer, be classified for use.
33 H. When the term “fair cash value” or the language “fair cash
44 value, estimated at the price it would bring at a fair voluntary
55 sale” is used in the Ad Valorem Tax Code, in connection with and in
66 relation to the assessment of real property, it is defined to mean
77 and shall be given the meaning ascribed and assigned to it in this
88 section and when the term or language is used in the Code in
99 connection with the assessment of personal property, it shall be
1100 given its ordinary or literal meaning.
1111 I. Where any real property is zoned for a use by a proper
1122 zoning authority, and the use of the property has not been changed,
1133 the use and not zoning shall determine assessment. Any reassessment
1144 required shall be effective January 1 following the change in use.
1155 Taxable real property need not be listed annually with the county
1166 assessor.
1177 J. If any real property shall become taxable after January 1 of
1188 any year, the county assessor shall assess the same and place it
1199 upon the tax rolls for the next ensuing year. When any building is
2200 constructed upon land after January 1 of any year, the value of the
2211 building shall be added by the county assessor to the assessed
2222 valuation of the land upon which the building is constructed at the
2233 fair cash value thereof for the next ensuing year. However, after
2244 the building has been completed it shall be deemed to have a value
Req. No. 13166 Page 16

11 for assessment purposes of the fair cash value of the materials used
22 in such building only, until the building and the land on which the
33 building is located shall have been conveyed to a bona fide
44 purchaser or shall have been occupied or used for any purpose other
55 than as a sales office by the owner thereof, or shall have been
66 leased, whichever event shall first occur. The county assessor
77 shall continue to assess the building based upon the fair market
88 value of the materials used therein until the building and land upon
99 which the building is located shall have been conveyed to a bona
1100 fide purchaser or is occupied or used for any purpose other than as
1111 a sales office by the owner thereof, or is leased, whichever event
1122 shall first occur. In the event a building or buildings described
1133 by this subsection are intended to serve primarily as residential
1144 rental housing, after the building or buildings have been completed
1155 they shall be deemed to have an initial value for assessment
1166 purposes not to exceed the fair cash value of the land and the
1177 actual documented cost of any improvements made to the building or
1188 buildings. The county assessor shall continue to assess such
1199 building or buildings at a value not to exceed the fair cash value
2200 of the land and actual documented cost of any improvements made
2211 until either two (2) years have passed since the date on which the
2222 building or buildings were first reflected on the tax rolls, or the
2233 building or buildings and the land on which the building or
2244
Req. No. 13166 Page 17

11 buil dings are located shall have been conveyed to a bona fide
22 purchaser, whichever event shall first occur.
33 K. In the event improvements on land or personal property
44 located therein or thereon are destroyed or partially destroyed, or
55 the land itself is impaired or partially impaired by fire,
66 lightning, storm, winds, floodwaters, overflow of streams, or other
77 cause (all such destruction or impairments being referred to herein
88 as “damage”) during any year, the county assessor shall determine
99 the amount of damage and shall reassess the property for that year
1100 at the fair cash value of the property, taking into account the
1111 actual loss of functional use of the property occasioned by such
1122 damage. The assessor shall make the appropriate value adjustments
1133 to the property for that tax year up to the time at which the
1144 assessor publishes the “Assessor’s assessor’s Report to the Excise
1155 Board” Board as required by subsection D of Section 2867 of this
1166 title. After such time, adjustments can be made only by the county
1177 board of tax roll corrections and only after the assessor has
1188 certified the tax roll for that year. The board secretary shall
1199 notify property owners in advance of the time and place at which the
2200 value adjustment to their property will be heard by the board. The
2211 board of tax roll corrections is authorized only to approve or
2222 reject the value adjustment submitted by the county assessor.
2233 L. All taxable personal property used in the exploration of
2244 oil, natural gas, or other minerals including drilling equipment and
Req. No. 13166 Page 18

11 rigs , shall be assessed annually at the value set forth in the first
22 Hadco International monthly bulletin published for the tax year,

66 commercial disposal systems of waste materials from the production
77 of oil and gas shall not include any contract rights or leases for
