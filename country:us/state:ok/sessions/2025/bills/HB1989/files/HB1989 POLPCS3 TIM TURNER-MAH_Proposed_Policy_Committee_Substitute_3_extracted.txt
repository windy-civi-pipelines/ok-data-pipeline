16 SECTION 1. NEW LAW A new section of law not to be

18 The Legislature finds that construction and operation of wind
19 turbines and construction of the towers used in connection with wind
20 turbines is a matter which is the proper subject of legislation.

22 commercial wind turbines for production of electrical energy by

24 limitations and that there is a need for uniformity in areas of the
Req. No. 12723 Page 1
1 stat e likely to be affected by the construction and operation of
2 towers and wind turbines. The Legislature finds that a combination
3 of both population density and average wind speed are a logical
4 basis in order to enact legislation related to setback requirements
5 for the structures used in the wind energy industry that pose risks
6 related to either persons or property or both in the event of damage
7 to the structures or structural failures.

15 C. On the first day of the month following the expiration of a
16 period of five (5) years after the effective date of this act, the
17 provisions of subsection B of this section shall continue to be
