22
23
D. It is the intent of the Legislature that every provision,
23
24

Section 18:
section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or word in the
24
Req. No. 1324 Page 4
1
definition of unlawful pornography is severable from each other,
1
2
such that if any of the listed items is found by a court to be
2
3
invalid or unconstitutional, the remaining items will be severed and
3
4
may not be affected. All constitutionally valid applications of
4
5
this section shall be severed from any application that a court
5
6
finds to be invalid, leaving the valid applications in force,
6
7
because it is the intent and priority of the Legislature that the
7
8
valid applications be allowed to stand alone. Even if a reviewing
8
9
court finds a provision of this section to be an unconstitutional
9
10
restraint in a large or substantial fraction of relevant cases, the
10
11
applications that do not present an unconstitutional restraint shall
11
12
be severed from the remaining applications and shall remain in
12
13
force, and shall be treated as if the Legislature had enacted a
13
14
statute limited to the person, group of persons, or circumstances
14
15
for which the application of the statute does not present an
15
16
unconstitutional restraint on protected speech. If any court
16
17
declares or finds a provision of this section facially
17
18
unconstitutional, when discrete applications of that provision can
18
19
be enforced against a persons, group of persons, or circumstances
19
20
without violating the United States Constitution and Oklahoma
20
21
Constitution, those applications shall be severed from all remaining
21
22
applications of the provision, and the provision shall be
22
23
interpreted as if the Legislature had enacted a provision limited to
23
24
the person, group of persons, or circumstances for which the
24
Req. No. 1324 Page 5
1
provision’s application will not violate the United States
1
2
Constitution and Oklahoma Constitution.
2
3
E. The Legislature further declares that it would have enacted
3
4
this section, and each provision, subsection, sentence, clause,
4
5
phrase, or word, and all constitutional applications of this
5
6

Section 19:
section, irrespective of the fact that any provision, subsection,
6
7
sentence, clause, phrase, or word, or application of this section,
7
8
were to be declared unconstitutional or to represent an
8
9
unconstitutional restraint. If any provision of this section is
9
10
found by any court to be unconstitutionally vague, then the
10
11
applications of that provision that do not present constitutional
11
12
vagueness problems shall be severed and remain in force. No court
12
13
may decline to enforce the severability requirements of this section
13
14
on the grounds that severance would rewrite the statute or involve
14
15
the court in legislative or lawmaking activity.
15
16
F. Each of the items of unlawful pornography in paragraph 6 of
16
17
subsection C of this section are depictions of sexual conduct which
17
18
are patently offensive under contemporary community standards in
18
19
this state, and have as their dominant theme an appeal to prurient
19
20
interest in sex under contemporary community standards of this
20
21
state, and may not be produced or distributed within the state if
21
22
they lack serious literary, artistic, educational, political, or
22
23
scientific purposes or value.
23
24
24
Req. No. 1324 Page 6

G. Any person, other than an officer or employee of a state or
1
2
local governmental entity in this state, may bring a civil action
2
3
against any person who:
3

10
11

Section 22:
3. Intends to engage in the conduct provided for in paragraphs
11
12
1 and 2 of this subsection.
12
13
H. If a claimant prevails in an action brought under this
13
14

Section 23:
section, the court shall award:
14
15

Section 24:
1. Injunctive relief sufficient to prevent the defendant from
15
16
violating this section or engaging in acts that aid or abet
16
17
violations of this section;
17
18

Section 25:
2. Statutory damages not less than Ten Thousand Dollars
18
19
($10,000.00) for each image or depiction produced or distributed
19
20
within this state; and

Section 26:

22
23
D. It is the intent of the Legislature that every provision,
23
24
section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or word in the
24
Req. No. 1324 Page 4

1
definition of unlawful pornography is severable from each other,
1
2
such that if any of the listed items is found by a court to be
2
3
invalid or unconstitutional, the remaining items will be severed and
3
4
may not be affected. All constitutionally valid applications of
4
5
this section shall be severed from any application that a court
5
6
finds to be invalid, leaving the valid applications in force,
6
7
because it is the intent and priority of the Legislature that the
7
8
valid applications be allowed to stand alone. Even if a reviewing
8
9
court finds a provision of this section to be an unconstitutional
9
10
restraint in a large or substantial fraction of relevant cases, the
10
11
applications that do not present an unconstitutional restraint shall
11
12
be severed from the remaining applications and shall remain in
12
13
force, and shall be treated as if the Legislature had enacted a
13
14
statute limited to the person, group of persons, or circumstances
14
15
for which the application of the statute does not present an
15
16
unconstitutional restraint on protected speech. If any court
16
17
declares or finds a provision of this section facially
17
18
unconstitutional, when discrete applications of that provision can
18
19
be enforced against a persons, group of persons, or circumstances
19
20
without violating the United States Constitution and Oklahoma
20
21
Constitution, those applications shall be severed from all remaining
21
22
applications of the provision, and the provision shall be
22
23
interpreted as if the Legislature had enacted a provision limited to
23
24
the person, group of persons, or circumstances for which the
24
Req. No. 1324 Page 5

1
provision’s application will not violate the United States
1
2
Constitution and Oklahoma Constitution.
2
3
E. The Legislature further declares that it would have enacted
3
4
this section, and each provision, subsection, sentence, clause,
4
5
phrase, or word, and all constitutional applications of this
5
6
section, irrespective of the fact that any provision, subsection,
6
7
sentence, clause, phrase, or word, or application of this section,
7
8
were to be declared unconstitutional or to represent an
8
9
unconstitutional restraint. If any provision of this section is
9
10
found by any court to be unconstitutionally vague, then the
10
11
applications of that provision that do not present constitutional
11
12
vagueness problems shall be severed and remain in force. No court
12
13
may decline to enforce the severability requirements of this section
13
14
on the grounds that severance would rewrite the statute or involve
14
15
the court in legislative or lawmaking activity.
15
16
F. Each of the items of unlawful pornography in paragraph 6 of
16
17
subsection C of this section are depictions of sexual conduct which
17
18
are patently offensive under contemporary community standards in
18
19
this state, and have as their dominant theme an appeal to prurient
19
20
interest in sex under contemporary community standards of this
20
21
state, and may not be produced or distributed within the state if
21
22
they lack serious literary, artistic, educational, political, or
22
23
scientific purposes or value.
23
24
24
Req. No. 1324 Page 6

G. Any person, other than an officer or employee of a state or
1
2
local governmental entity in this state, may bring a civil action
2
3
against any person who:
3
4
1. Produces or distributes unlawful pornography that lacks
4
5
serious literary, artistic, educational, political, or scientific
5

purposes or value;

2. Knowingly engages in conduct that aids or abets the
7

9
10
purposes or value; or
10
11
3. Intends to engage in the conduct provided for in paragraphs
11
12
1 and 2 of this subsection.
12
13
H. If a claimant prevails in an action brought under this
13
14
section, the court shall award:
14
15
1. Injunctive relief sufficient to prevent the defendant from
15
16
violating this section or engaging in acts that aid or abet
16
17
violations of this section;
17
18
2. Statutory damages not less than Ten Thousand Dollars
18
19
($10,000.00) for each image or depiction produced or distributed
19
20
within this state; and
20
21
3. Court costs and attorney fees.
21
22
I. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a court may not
22
23
award court costs or attorney fees to a defendant in an action
23
24
brought under this section.
