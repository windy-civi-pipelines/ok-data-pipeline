shall by its own terms describe the property by its specific legal
4

description, and provide such information as is necessary for
5
6
indexing as required in Sections 287 and 291 of this title, and on
6
7
each such instrument shall be listed the mailing address of the
7
8
grantee, mortgagee, assignee, or other designated party to which the
8

10
offered to a county clerk for recording contains more than twenty-
10
11
five legal descriptions requiring separate entries in the indexes
11
12
required by Sections 287 and 291 of this title, the descriptions
12
13
shall be sorted by addition, block, and lot if platted property, or

14
15
description. Any instrument offered to a county clerk for recording
15
16
containing more than twenty-five legal descriptions per page,
16
17
counted as each description which could require a separate line
17
18
entry in the numerical index, shall be accompanied by an additional
18
19
filing fee of One Dollar ($1.00) per legal description in excess of
19
20
twenty-five legal descriptions per page to be paid to the county
20
21
clerk. Unless the person offering a nonconforming instrument for
21
22
filing is willing to reform the instrument to conform to statutory
22
23
requirements, for which purpose it may be withdrawn and refiled

24
during the same business day, the county clerk may refuse to record

19

19
20
part of a signature or any stray markings within the margin shall
20

not void the requirements for accepting and filing any document by
21
22
any county within the state, provided there remains sufficient space
22
23
for the affixation of stamps and recording information without

12
13
completion of the filing and submit a formal and immediate inquiry
13
14
to the local district attorney to investigate and make a
14
15
determination as to whether the awaiting filing of a deed is
15
16
fraudulent or is a legitimate deed conveyance. The district
16
17
attorney shall verify with the original deed holder if they want to
17
18
allow the new deed to be filed or if they want to halt the filing.
18
19
If the deed holder does not respond within five (5) business days
19
20
and every reasonable attempt has been made to contact such deed
20
21
holder, then the county clerk shall complete the proposed filing.
21
