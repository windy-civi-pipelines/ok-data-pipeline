SUBJECT: Counties and county officers
BE IT ENACTED BY THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF OKLAHOMA:
SECTION 1. AMENDATORY 19 O.S. 2021, Section 1505, as
amended by Section 3, Chapter 94, O.S.L. 2022 (19 O.S. Supp. 2024,
Section 1505), is amended to read as follows:
Section 1505. The following procedures shall be used by
counties for the requisition, purchase, lease-purchase, rental, and
receipt of supplies, materials, road and bridge construction
services, equipment and information technology and telecommunication
goods and services for the maintenance, operation, and capital
expenditures of county government unless otherwise provided for by
law.
A. The procedure for requisitioning items for county offices
shall be as follows:
1. The requesting department shall prepare a requisition form
in triplicate. The requisition shall contain any specifications for

an item as deemed necessary by the requesting department. The form
shall be prescribed by the State Auditor and Inspector;
2. The requesting department shall retain a copy of the
requisition and forward the original requisition and a copy to the
county purchasing agent; and
3. Upon receipt of the requisition, the county purchasing
agent, within two (2) working days, shall begin the bidding and
purchasing process as provided for in this section. Nothing in this
section shall prohibit the transfer of supplies, materials, or
equipment between county departments upon a written agreement
between county officers.
B. The bid procedure for selecting a vendor for the purchase,
lease-purchase, or rental of supplies, materials, equipment and
information technology and telecommunication goods and services used
by a county shall be as follows:
1. The county purchasing agent shall request written
recommendations from all county officers pertaining to needed or
commonly used supplies, materials, road and bridge construction
services, equipment and information technology and telecommunication
goods and services. From such recommendations and available
requisition, purchase, or inventory records, the county purchasing
agent shall prepare a list of items needed or commonly used by
county officers. The county purchasing agent shall request from the
Purchasing Division or from the Information Services Division in the
case of information technology and telecommunication goods and
services of the Office of Management and Enterprise Services all
contracts quoting the price the state is paying for the items. The
county purchasing agent shall either request the Purchasing Division
or the Information Services Division of the Office of Management and
Enterprise Services, as applicable, to make the purchase for the
county or the county purchasing agent shall solicit bids for unit
prices on the items for periods of not to exceed twelve (12) months
in the manner described in paragraph 2 of this subsection. If the
county purchasing agent receives a requisition for an item for which
the county purchasing agent does not have a current bid, the county
purchasing agent shall request from the Purchasing Division or the
Information Services Division of the Office of Management and
Enterprise Services, as applicable, all contracts quoting the price
the state is paying for the item. The county purchasing agent shall
either request the Purchasing Division or the Information Services
Division of the Office of Management and Enterprise Services, as
ENR. H. B. NO. 2165 Page 2

applicable, to make the purchase for the county or the county
purchasing agent shall solicit bids in the manner described in
paragraph 2 of this subsection. Nothing in this paragraph shall
prohibit bids from being taken on an item currently on a twelve-
month bid list, at any time deemed necessary by the county
purchasing agent. Whenever the county purchasing agent deems it
necessary to take a bid on an item currently on a twelve-month bid
list, the reason for the bid shall be entered into the minutes of
the board of county commissioners;
2. Bids shall be solicited by mailing or emailing a notice to
all persons or firms who have made a written request of the county
purchasing agent that they be notified of such bid solicitation and
to all other persons or firms who might reasonably be expected to
submit bids. Notice of solicitation of bids shall also be published
one time in a newspaper of general circulation in the county.
Notices shall be mailed and published at least ten (10) days prior
to the date on which the bids are opened. Proof of the mailing or
emailing shall be made by the affidavit of the person mailing or
emailing the request for bids and shall be made a part of the
official records of the county purchasing agent. The notice shall
specify whether the county will consider written bids, electronic
bids, or both; the decision to exclusively consider either written
bids or electronic bids shall be determined pursuant to an
affirmative vote of the board of county commissioners. Whenever any
prospective supplier or vendor dealing in or listing for sale any
particular item or article required to be purchased or acquired by
sealed bids fails to enter or offer a sealed bid for three
successive bid solicitations, the name of the supplier or vendor may
be dropped from the mailing lists of the board of county
commissioners;
3. The sealed bids received from vendors and the state contract
price received from the applicable Division of the Office of
Management and Enterprise Services shall be given to the county
clerk by the county purchasing agent. The county clerk shall
forward the sealed bids and state contract price, if any, to the
board of county commissioners;
4. The board of county commissioners, in an open meeting, shall
open the sealed bids and compare them to the state contract price.
The board of county commissioners shall select the lowest and best
bid based upon, if applicable, the availability of material and
transportation cost to the job site within thirty (30) days of the
meeting. For any special item not included on the list of needed or
ENR. H. B. NO. 2165 Page 3

commonly used items, the requisitioning official shall review the
bids and submit a written recommendation to the board before final
approval. The board of county commissioners shall keep a written
record of the meeting as required by law, and any time the lowest
bid was not considered to be the lowest and best bid, the reason for
such conclusion shall be recorded. Whenever the board of county
commissioners rejects the written recommendation of the
requisitioning official pertaining to a special item, the reasons
for the rejection shall be entered in their minutes and stated in a
letter to the requisitioning official and county purchasing agent;
5. The county purchasing agent shall notify the successful
bidders and shall maintain a copy of the notification. The county
purchasing agent shall prepare and maintain a vendors list
specifying the successful bidders and shall notify each county
officer of the list. The county purchasing agent may remove any
vendor from such list who refuses to provide goods or services as
provided by contract if the removal is authorized by the board of
county commissioners. The county purchasing agent may make
purchases from the successful bidders for a price at or below the
bid price. If a vendor who is the low bidder cannot or will not
sell goods or services as required by a county bid contract, the
county purchasing agent may make a one-time purchase from the next
lowest or best quote or take quotations as provided in paragraph 6
of this subsection; provided, however, such purchase does not exceed
Twenty-five Thousand Dollars ($25,000.00) as the amount specified in
subparagraph a of paragraph 3 of subsection A of Section 1501 of
this title; and
6. When bids have been solicited as provided for by law and no
bids have been received, the procedure shall be as follows:
a. the county purchasing agent shall determine if
potential vendors are willing to commit to a firm
price for a reduced period of time, and, if such is
the case, the bid procedure described in this
subsection shall be followed,
b. if vendors are not willing to commit to a firm price
for a reduced period, the purchasing agent shall
solicit and record at least three (3) quotes of
current prices available to the county and authorize
the purchase of goods or services based on the lowest
and best quote as it becomes necessary to acquire such
goods or services. The quotes shall be recorded on a
ENR. H. B. NO. 2165 Page 4

form prescribed by the State Auditor and Inspector and
shall be attached to the purchase order and filed with
the county clerk's copy of the purchase order. Any
time the lowest quote was not considered to be the
lowest and best quote, the reason for this conclusion
shall be recorded by the county purchasing agent and
transmitted to the county clerk, or
c. if three quotes are not available, a memorandum to the
county clerk from the county purchasing agent shall
describe the basis upon which a purchase is
authorized. The memorandum shall state the reasons
why the price for such a purchase is the lowest and
best under the circumstances. The county clerk shall
then attach the memorandum to the county clerk's copy
of the purchase order and file both in the office of
the county clerk.
C. After selection of a vendor, the procedure for the purchase,
lease-purchase, or rental of supplies, materials, road and bridge
construction services, equipment and information technology and
telecommunication goods and services used by a county shall be as
follows:
1. The county purchasing agent shall prepare a purchase order
in quadruplicate and submit it with a copy of the requisition to the
county clerk;
2. The county clerk shall then encumber the amount stated on
the purchase order and assign a sequential number to the purchase
order;
3. If there is an unencumbered balance in the appropriation
made for that purpose by the county excise board, the county clerk
shall so certify in the following form:
"I hereby certify that the amount of this encumbrance has been
entered against the designated appropriation accounts and that this
encumbrance is within the authorized available balance of the
appropriation.
Dated this ________ day of ________, 20__.

In instances where it is impossible to ascertain the exact amount of
the indebtedness sought to be incurred at the time of recording the
encumbrance, an estimated amount may be used. No purchase order
shall be valid unless signed by the county purchasing agent and
certified by the county clerk; and
4. The county clerk shall file the original purchase order and
return three (3) copies to the county purchasing agent who shall
file a copy, retain a copy for the county road and bridge inventory
officer if the purchase order is for the purchase of equipment,
supplies, or materials for the construction or maintenance of roads
and bridges, and submit the other copy to the receiving officer of
the requesting department.
D. 1. The procedure for the purchase of supplies, materials,
equipment and information technology and telecommunication goods and
services at public auction or by sealed bid to be used by a county
shall be as follows:
a. the county purchasing agent shall prepare a purchase
order in quadruplicate and submit it with a copy of
the requisition to the county clerk,
b. the county clerk shall then encumber the amount stated
on the purchase order and assign a sequential number
to the purchase order,

disallowing same at any future meeting of the board held within
seventy-five (75) days from the date of filing of the purchase

Office to the board of county commissioners. The approval of the
