Req. No. 11043 Page 2

1 requ isition, purchase, or inventory records, the county purchasing
2 agent shall prepare a list of items needed or commonly used by
3 county officers. The county purchasing agent shall request from the
4 Purchasing Division or from the Information Services Division in the
5 case of information technology and telecommunication goods and
6 services of the Office of Management and Enterprise Services all
7 contracts quoting the price the state is paying for the items. The
8 county purchasing agent shall either request the Purchasing Division
9 or the Information Services Division of the Office of Management and
10 Enterprise Services, as applicable, to make the purchase for the
11 county or the county purchasing agent shall solicit bids for unit
12 prices on the items for periods of not to exceed twelve (12) months
13 in the manner described in paragraph 2 of this subsection. If the
14 county purchasing agent receives a requisition for an item for which

Req. No. 11043 Page 3

1 proh ibit bids from being taken on an item currently on a twelve-
2 month bid list, at any time deemed necessary by the county
3 purchasing agent. Whenever the county purchasing agent deems it
4 necessary to take a bid on an item currently on a twelve-month bid
5 list, the reason for the bid shall be entered into the minutes of
6 the board of county commissioners;
7 2. Bids shall be solicited by mailing or emailing a notice to
8 all persons or firms who have made a written request of the county
9 purchasing agent that they be notified of such bid solicitation and
10 to all other persons or firms who might reasonably be expected to
11 submit bids. Notice of solicitation of bids shall also be published
12 one time in a newspaper of general circulation in the county.
13 Notices shall be mailed and published at least ten (10) days prior
14 to the date on which the bids are opened. Proof of the mailing or
15 emailing shall be made by the affidavit of the person mailing or
16 emailing the request for bids and shall be made a part of the
17 official records of the county purchasing agent. The notice shall
18 specify whether the county will consider written bids, electronic
19 bids, or both; the decision to exclusively consider either written
20 bids or electronic bids shall be determined pursuant to an
21 affirmative vote of the board of county commissioners. Whenever any
22 prospective supplier or vendor dealing in or listing for sale any
23 particular item or article required to be purchased or acquired by
24 sealed bids fails to enter or offer a sealed bid for three
Req. No. 11043 Page 4

1 succ essive bid solicitations, the name of the supplier or vendor may
2 be dropped from the mailing lists of the board of county
3 commissioners;
4 3. The sealed bids received from vendors and the state contract
5 price received from the applicable Division of the Office of
6 Management and Enterprise Services shall be given to the county
7 clerk by the county purchasing agent. The county clerk shall
8 forward the sealed bids and state contract price, if any, to the
9 board of county commissioners;
10 4. The board of county commissioners, in an open meeting, shall
11 open the sealed bids and compare them to the state contract price.
12 The board of county commissioners shall select the lowest and best
13 bid based upon, if applicable, the availability of material and
14 transportation cost to the job site within thirty (30) days of the
15 meeting. For any special item not included on the list of needed or
16 commonly used items, the requisitioning official shall review the
17 bids and submit a written recommendation to the board before final
18 approval. The board of county commissioners shall keep a written
19 record of the meeting as required by law, and any time the lowest
20 bid was not considered to be the lowest and best bid, the reason for
21 such conclusion shall be recorded. Whenever the board of county
22 commissioners rejects the written recommendation of the
23 requisitioning official pertaining to a special item, the reasons
24
Req. No. 11043 Page 5

1 for the rejection shall be entered in their minutes and stated in a
2 letter to the requisitioning official and county purchasing agent;
3 5. The county purchasing agent shall notify the successful
4 bidders and shall maintain a copy of the notification. The county
5 purchasing agent shall prepare and maintain a vendors list
6 specifying the successful bidders and shall notify each county
7 officer of the list. The county purchasing agent may remove any
8 vendor from such list who refuses to provide goods or services as
9 provided by contract if the removal is authorized by the board of
10 county commissioners. The county purchasing agent may make
11 purchases from the successful bidders for a price at or below the
12 bid price. If a vendor who is the low bidder cannot or will not
13 sell goods or services as required by a county bid contract, the
14 county purchasing agent may make a one-time purchase from the next
15 lowest or best quote or take quotations as provided in paragraph 6
16 of this subsection; provided, however, such purchase does not exceed
17 Twenty-five Thousand Dollars ($25,000.00) as the amount specified in
18 subparagraph a of paragraph 3 of subsection A of Section 1501 of
19 this title; and
20 6. When bids have been solicited as provided for by law and no
21 bids have been received, the procedure shall be as follows:
22 a. the county purchasing agent shall determine if
23 potential vendors are willing to commit to a firm
24 price for a reduced period of time, and, if such is
Req. No. 11043 Page 6

1 the case, the bid procedure described in this
2 subsection shall be followed,
3 b. if vendors are not willing to commit to a firm price
4 for a reduced period, the purchasing agent shall
5 solicit and record at least three (3) quotes of
6 current prices available to the county and authorize
7 the purchase of goods or services based on the lowest
8 and best quote as it becomes necessary to acquire such
9 goods or services. The quotes shall be recorded on a
10 form prescribed by the State Auditor and Inspector and
11 shall be attached to the purchase order and filed with
12 the county clerk's copy of the purchase order. Any
13 time the lowest quote was not considered to be the
14 lowest and best quote, the reason for this conclusion
15 shall be recorded by the county purchasing agent and
16 transmitted to the county clerk, or
17 c. if three quotes are not available, a memorandum to the
18 county clerk from the county purchasing agent shall
19 describe the basis upon which a purchase is
20 authorized. The memorandum shall state the reasons
21 why the price for such a purchase is the lowest and
22 best under the circumstances. The county clerk shall
23 then attach the memorandum to the county clerk's copy
