24 is created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:
Req. No. 1830 Page 1

1 A. As used in this section, “public utility” means a
2 municipally owned utility or other publicly owned utility providing
3 sewage services through a sanitary sewer system.
4 B. The governing body of the public utility shall adopt a plan
5 that includes, but is not limited to, the following:

12 property owners who are connected to the sanitary sewer system of

15 applications for funding considers the sustainability efforts of
16 systems that adopted the plans identified in this statute.
17 F. There shall be no right of recovery for personal injury from
18 a sanitary sewer overflow, provided that the utility charged with

20 sanitary sewer system in accordance with the guidance and criteria
21 promulgated by the governing body pursuant to subsection B of this
