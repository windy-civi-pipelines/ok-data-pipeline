21
22
year to the General Revenue Fund and to each Special Revenue Fund
22
23
revenue fund appropriated directly by the Legislature, and shall
23
24

2
hereinafter provided, an estimate of the revenues to be received by
2
3
the state under the laws in effect at the time such determination is
3
4
made, for the next ensuing fiscal year, showing separately the
4

revenues to accrue to the credit of each such fund of the state
5
6
appropriated directly by the Legislature. The State Board of
6
7
Equalization shall also certify annually a tax expenditure
7
8
limitation equal to a percentage which is the sum of the rate of
8
9
inflation and the percent increase in population growth for the
9
10
state for the previous calendar year; provided, no tax expenditure
10
11
limitation shall be certified during any year in which the certified
11
12
estimate of the General Revenue Fund and each revenue fund
12
13
appropriated directly by the Legislature for the next fiscal year is
13
14
less than the amount certified as accruing to such funds for the
14
15
previous fiscal year.
15
16
Amounts certified as available for appropriation from estimated

17
to accrue to each fund, as hereinbefore provided, shall be subject
17
18
to a spending limit. Such spending limit shall be determined as

a. if the amount of the certified estimate available for
20
21
appropriation for the next fiscal year for the General
21
22
Revenue Fund and all revenue funds appropriated
22
23
directly by the Legislature, as compared to the amount
23
24
finally certified as accruing to the state in such
24
Req. No. 1073 Page 3
1
funds for the preceding fiscal year, has decreased or
1
2
has increased over revenue finally certified as
2
3
accruing to the state in such funds for the preceding
3
4
fiscal year by a percentage less than the tax
4
5
expenditure limitation, ninety-five percent (95%) of
5
6
an itemized estimate of revenues to be received by the
6
7
state for the next fiscal year made by the State Board
7
8
of Equalization, which shall be the spending limit, or
8
9
b. if the amount of the certified estimate for the next
9
10
fiscal year for the General Revenue Fund and all
10
11
revenue funds appropriated directly by the Legislature
11
12
has increased over revenue finally certified as
12
13
accruing to such funds for the preceding fiscal year
13
14
by a percentage more than the tax expenditure
14
15
limitation, the spending limit shall be equal to the
15
16
highest spending limit certified for any preceding
16
17
year plus a percentage equal to the tax expenditure
17
18
limitation not to exceed ninety-five percent (95%) of
18
19
the estimate of revenues to be received by the state
19
20
in such fund for the next fiscal year. The estimate
20
21
made by the State Board of Equalization of revenues to
21
22
accrue to the state shall include all sources of
22
23
revenue to each fund for the next ensuing fiscal year;
23
24
provided, however, appropriated federal funds shall be
24
Req. No. 1073 Page 4
1
certified for the full amount of the estimate. Said
1
2
estimate shall consider any increase or decline in
2
3
revenues that would result from predictable changes in
3
4
the economy.
4
5
Legislative appropriations for any fiscal year, except for
5
6
special appropriations provided for in paragraph 6, 7 or 8 shall be
6
7
limited to a sum not to exceed the total amount appropriated from
7
8
all funds in the preceding fiscal year, plus twelve percent (12%),
8
9
adjusted for inflation for the previous calendar year. Said limit
9
10
shall be adjusted for funds not previously appropriated. The

15
16
not pass or enact any bill, act or measure making an appropriation
16
17

are made and filed, unless the State Board of Equalization has
18
19
failed to file said certification certifications at the time of
19
20
convening of said Legislature. In such event, it shall be the duty
20
21
of the Legislature to make such certification certifications
21
22
pursuant to the provisions of this section. All appropriations made
22
23
in excess of such certification the spending limit established
23
24
pursuant to this section shall be null and void; provided, however,
24
Req. No. 1073 Page 5
1
that the Legislature may at any regular session or special session,
1
2
called for that purpose, enact laws to provide for additional

revenues pursuant to Section 33 of Article V of the Constitution of
3
4
the State of Oklahoma or a reduction in revenues, other than ad
4
5
valorem taxes, or transferring the existing revenues or
5
6
unappropriated cash on hand from one fund to another, or making
6
7
provisions for appropriating funds not previously appropriated
7
8
directly by the Legislature. Whereupon, it shall be the duty of the
8
9
State Board of Equalization to make a determination of the revenues
9
10
that will accrue under such laws and ninety-five percent (95%) of
10
11
the amount of any increase or decrease resulting, for any reason,
11
12
from such changes in laws shall be added to or deducted from the
12
13
amount previously certified available for appropriation from as
13

estimated to be received by the state in each respective fund, as
14
15
the case may be. The State Board of Equalization shall file the
15

amount of such adjusted certification, or additional certification
16
17
for funds not previously appropriated directly by the Legislature,
17
18
with the Governor, with the President and President Pro Tempore of
18
19
the Senate, and the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and

appropriated for all purposes from any such fund for the fiscal year
21
22
being certified.

23
24
days after the monthly apportionment in February of each year, and
24
Req. No. 1073 Page 6

current information available, and determine the amount of funds
2

the Legislature for the preceding fiscal year. Any interest income
18
19
earned on the balance of the Constitutional Emergency Fund shall
19
20
accrue to the fund and shall be included in the fund total.

the people; provided, emergency shall not include a revenue or
5
6
budget shortfall.

7
8
beginning of the current fiscal year in the
8
9
Constitutional Reserve Fund may be appropriated for
9
10
the forthcoming fiscal year, when the certification by
10
11
the State Board of Equalization for said forthcoming
11
12
fiscal year General Revenue Fund is less than that of
12
13
the current fiscal year certification. In no event
13
14
shall the amount of monies appropriated from the
14
15
Constitutional Reserve Fund be in excess of the
15
16
difference between the two said certifications.
16
17
b. (1) In years when the provisions of subparagraph a of
17
18
this paragraph are not applicable and the balance
18
19
at the beginning of the current fiscal year in
19
20
the Constitutional Reserve Fund is equal to or
20
21
greater than Eighty Million Dollars
21
22
($80,000,000.00), up to Ten Million Dollars
22
23
($10,000,000.00) may be expended for the purpose
23
24
of providing incentives to support retention of
24
Req. No. 1073 Page 8
1
at-risk manufacturing establishments in this
1
2
state in order to retain employment for residents
2
3
of this state. Such incentives shall be paid by
3
4
the Oklahoma Tax Commission upon a unanimous
4
5
finding by the Governor, the Speaker of the House
5
6
of Representatives and the President Pro Tempore
6
7
of the Senate that:
7
8
(a) such incentives have been recommended by an
8
9
independent committee created by the
9
10
Legislature for such purposes as provided
10
11
herein pursuant to criteria set out by law,
11
12
(b) the incentive will result in a substantial
12
13
benefit to this state, and
13
14
(c) payment of the incentive would be in
14
15
accordance with the provisions of this
15
16
subparagraph and laws enacted to implement
16
17
provisions of this subparagraph.
17
18
(2) The independent committee will be composed of not
18
19
less than seven (7) people appointed or otherwise
19
20
determined pursuant to laws enacted by the
20
21
Legislature providing for membership on the
21
22
committee. The committee shall make
22
23
recommendations to the Governor, the Speaker of
23
24
the House of Representatives and the President
24
Req. No. 1073 Page 9
1
Pro Tempore of the Senate for the awarding of
1
2
incentives. Such recommendations shall give
2
3
priority to establishments which:
3
4
(a) are at greater risk of losing jobs because
4
5
the plant is no longer competitive or
5
6
leaving the state and thereby causing the
6
7
loss of more employment in this state than
7
8
other eligible recipients, and
8
9
(b) provide the largest economic impact to the
9
10
state.
10
11
(3) For any fiscal year, the incentives shall not
11
12
exceed ten percent (10%) of the amount invested
12
13
by an establishment in capital assets to be
13
14
utilized in this state. Incentives may only be
14
15
paid pursuant to an investment contract between
15
16
the establishment and a state agency designated
16
17
by law, which provides for a specified amount of
17
18
investment in a capital asset to be made by the
18
19
establishment over a period of not to exceed five
19
20
(5) years. No incentive payment shall be made
20
21
prior to the actual investment by the
21
22
establishment. The contract shall make payment
22
23
of any incentives in any fiscal year contingent
23
24
on the balance at the beginning of such fiscal
24
Req. No. 1073 Page 10
1
year in the Constitutional Reserve Fund being
1
2
equal to or greater than Eighty Million Dollars
2
3
($80,000,000.00) and on the certification by the
3
4
State Board of Equalization for such fiscal year
4
5
of the amount available for appropriation from
5
6
the General Revenue Fund being greater than the
6
7
amount certified for the preceding fiscal year.
7
8
Investment contracts authorized by this
8
9
subparagraph shall provide that if any incentive
9
10
payment is payable during a fiscal year in which
10
11
either the balance at the beginning of the fiscal
11
12
year in the Constitutional Reserve Fund is not
12
13
equal to or greater than Eighty Million Dollars
13
14
($80,000,000.00) or when the certification by the
14
15
State Board of Equalization for such fiscal year
15
16
General Revenue Fund is less than that of the
16
17
immediately prior fiscal year certification, then
17
18
any incentive payments which would have been
18
19
payable during such fiscal year shall be payable
19
20
in the first fiscal year when funds are available
20
21
pursuant to the provisions of division (1) of
21
22
this subparagraph. In the event that the amount
22
23
of incentives payable under investment contracts
23
24
authorized by this subparagraph is greater than
24
Req. No. 1073 Page 11
1
the amounts available for payment under this
1
2
subparagraph in a fiscal year, then no new
2
3
contracts may be authorized during such year and
3
4
incentive payments which are made shall be
4
5
reduced pro rata as necessary to apply all
5
6
available funds to incentive payments which are
6
7
payable in such year.

18
of the amount of the projected revenue failure in the General
18
19
Revenue Fund, which total amount shall be computed by the State

20
21
appropriated to any state governmental entity from the

22
23
made in order to ensure that the monies actually received by the

23
24
derived from any law or laws which allocate the revenues thereof to
24
Req. No. 1073 Page 15

such department, institution or agency shall not incur obligations
1
2
in excess of the unencumbered balance of cash on hand. Nothing in

this section shall prevent, under such conditions and limitations as
3
4
shall be prescribed by law, the governing board of an institution of

5
higher education within The Oklahoma State System of Higher

6
Education from contracting with a president of such institution of

Section 17:
10. 9. The Legislature shall provide a method whereby
10
11
appropriations shall be divided and set up on a monthly, quarterly
11
12
or semiannual basis within each fiscal year to prevent obligations
12
13
being incurred in excess of the revenue to be collected, and
13
14
notwithstanding other provisions of this Constitution, the
14
15
Legislature shall provide that all appropriations shall be reduced
15
16
to bring them within revenues actually collected, but all such
16
17
reductions shall apply to each department, institution, board,
17
18
commission or special appropriation made by the State Legislature in
18
19
the ratio that its total appropriation for that fiscal year bears to
19
20
the total of all appropriations from that fund for that fiscal year;
20
21
provided, however, that the Governor shall have discretion to issue
21
22
deficiency certificates to the State Treasurer for the benefit of
22
23
any department, institution or agency of the state, if the amount of
23
24
such deficiency certificates be within the limit of the current
24
Req. No. 1073 Page 16
1
appropriation for that department, institution or agency, whereupon
1
2
the State Treasurer shall issue warrants to the extent of such
2
3
certificates for the payment of such claims as may be authorized by
3
4
the Governor, and such warrants shall become a part of the public
4
5
debt and shall be paid out of any money appropriated by the
5
6
Legislature and made lawfully available therefor; provided further,
6
7
that in no event shall said deficiency certificates exceed in the
7
8
aggregate the sum of Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000.00) in
8
9
any fiscal year.

15
THE GIST OF THE PROPOSITION IS AS FOLLOWS:
15
16
This measure amends Section 23 of Article 10 of the Oklahoma
16
17
Constitution. It sets limits on growth in state revenue and
17
18
spending. It changes the way the State Board of Equalization
18
19
figures how much can be spent. The Board would set a tax
19
20
expenditure limit. The limit would set how much state spending
20
21
could go up from year to year. Revenue above a certain amount
21
22
would become surplus. A certain amount of surplus funds would
22
23
go into a Constitutional Emergency Fund. Money from that fund
23
24
could only be spent under certain conditions. Revenue in the
24
Req. No. 1073 Page 17
1
Constitutional Emergency Fund above a certain amount would be
1
2
deposited into a Budget Stabilization Fund. A part of that fund
2
3
could be spent only if a revenue failure exists. Once the
3
4
Budget Stabilization Fund has reached a certain level, some
4
5
revenue would be refunded to taxpayers. The Board could not
5
6
spend over the tax expenditure limitation without voter
6
7
approval.

10
against the state, or any department, institution or agency thereof,
10

12
paid, except as may be provided in this section and in Sections 24
12
13
and 25 of Article X of the Constitution of the State of Oklahoma
13
14
this article.
14
15
To ensure a balanced annual budget and to limit the growth of
15
16
revenue and expenditures, pursuant to the limitations contained in

17
the foregoing, procedures are herewith established as follows:

(35) days prior to the convening of each regular session of the
19
20
Legislature, the State Board of Equalization shall certify the total
20

amount of revenue which accrued during the last preceding fiscal
21
22
year to the General Revenue Fund and to each Special Revenue Fund

23
revenue fund appropriated directly by the Legislature, and shall
23
24
further certify amounts available for appropriation which shall be
24
Req. No. 1073 Page 2

1
based on a determination, in accordance with the procedure
1
2
hereinafter provided, an estimate of the revenues to be received by
2
3
the state under the laws in effect at the time such determination is
3
4
made, for the next ensuing fiscal year, showing separately the
4
5
revenues to accrue to the credit of each such fund of the state
5
6
appropriated directly by the Legislature. The State Board of
6
7
Equalization shall also certify annually a tax expenditure
7
8
limitation equal to a percentage which is the sum of the rate of
8
9
inflation and the percent increase in population growth for the
9
10
state for the previous calendar year; provided, no tax expenditure
10
11
limitation shall be certified during any year in which the certified
11
12
estimate of the General Revenue Fund and each revenue fund
12
13
appropriated directly by the Legislature for the next fiscal year is
13
14
less than the amount certified as accruing to such funds for the
14
15
previous fiscal year.
15
16
Amounts certified as available for appropriation from estimated
16
17
to accrue to each fund, as hereinbefore provided, shall be subject
17
18
to a spending limit. Such spending limit shall be determined as

19
follows:
19
20
a. if the amount of the certified estimate available for
20
21
appropriation for the next fiscal year for the General
21
22
Revenue Fund and all revenue funds appropriated
22
23
directly by the Legislature, as compared to the amount
23
24
finally certified as accruing to the state in such
24
Req. No. 1073 Page 3

1
funds for the preceding fiscal year, has decreased or
1
2
has increased over revenue finally certified as
2
3
accruing to the state in such funds for the preceding
3
4
fiscal year by a percentage less than the tax
4
5
expenditure limitation, ninety-five percent (95%) of
5
6
an itemized estimate of revenues to be received by the
6
7
state for the next fiscal year made by the State Board
7
8
of Equalization, which shall be the spending limit, or
8
9
b. if the amount of the certified estimate for the next

10
fiscal year for the General Revenue Fund and all
10
11
revenue funds appropriated directly by the Legislature
11
12
has increased over revenue finally certified as
12
13
accruing to such funds for the preceding fiscal year
13
14
by a percentage more than the tax expenditure
14
15
limitation, the spending limit shall be equal to the
15
16
highest spending limit certified for any preceding
16
17
year plus a percentage equal to the tax expenditure
17
18
limitation not to exceed ninety-five percent (95%) of
18
19
the estimate of revenues to be received by the state
19
20
in such fund for the next fiscal year. The estimate
20
21
made by the State Board of Equalization of revenues to
21
22
accrue to the state shall include all sources of
22
23
revenue to each fund for the next ensuing fiscal year;
23
24
provided, however, appropriated federal funds shall be
24
Req. No. 1073 Page 4

1
certified for the full amount of the estimate. Said
1
2
estimate shall consider any increase or decline in
2
3
revenues that would result from predictable changes in
3
4
the economy.
4
5
Legislative appropriations for any fiscal year, except for
5
6
special appropriations provided for in paragraph 6, 7 or 8 shall be
6
7
limited to a sum not to exceed the total amount appropriated from
7
8
all funds in the preceding fiscal year, plus twelve percent (12%),
8
9
adjusted for inflation for the previous calendar year. Said limit
9
10
shall be adjusted for funds not previously appropriated. The
10
11
spending limit on the growth of appropriations shall be certified to
11
12
by the State Board of Equalization.
12
13
2. Such certification certifications shall be filed with the
13
14
Governor, the President and President Pro Tempore of the Senate, and
14
15
the Speaker of the House of Representatives. The Legislature shall
15
16
not pass or enact any bill, act or measure making an appropriation
16
17

are made and filed, unless the State Board of Equalization has
18
19
failed to file said certification certifications at the time of
19
20
convening of said Legislature. In such event, it shall be the duty
20
21
of the Legislature to make such certification certifications
21
22
pursuant to the provisions of this section. All appropriations made
22
23
in excess of such certification the spending limit established
23
24
pursuant to this section shall be null and void; provided, however,
24
Req. No. 1073 Page 5

1
that the Legislature may at any regular session or special session,
1
2
called for that purpose, enact laws to provide for additional
2

revenues pursuant to Section 33 of Article V of the Constitution of
3
4
the State of Oklahoma or a reduction in revenues, other than ad
4
5
valorem taxes, or transferring the existing revenues or
5
6
unappropriated cash on hand from one fund to another, or making
6
7
provisions for appropriating funds not previously appropriated
7
8
directly by the Legislature. Whereupon, it shall be the duty of the
8
9
State Board of Equalization to make a determination of the revenues
9
10
that will accrue under such laws and ninety-five percent (95%) of
10
11
the amount of any increase or decrease resulting, for any reason,
11
12
from such changes in laws shall be added to or deducted from the
12
13
amount previously certified available for appropriation from as
13
14
estimated to be received by the state in each respective fund, as
14
15
the case may be. The State Board of Equalization shall file the
15
16
amount of such adjusted certification, or additional certification
16
17
for funds not previously appropriated directly by the Legislature,
17
18
with the Governor, with the President and President Pro Tempore of
18
19
the Senate, and the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and
19
20
such adjusted amount shall be the maximum amount which can be
20
21
appropriated for all purposes from any such fund for the fiscal year
21
22
being certified.
22
23
3. The State Board of Equalization shall meet within five (5)
23
24
days after the monthly apportionment in February of each year, and
24
Req. No. 1073 Page 6

1
at that time may adjust the certification, based upon the most
1
2
current information available, and determine the amount of funds
2
3
available for appropriation for that legislative session. At said
3
4
meeting the Board shall determine the limit on the growth of
4
5
appropriations as provided for in this section.
5
6
4. Surplus funds or monies shall be any amount accruing to the
6
7
General Revenue Fund of the State of Oklahoma and all other revenue
7
8
funds appropriated directly by the Legislature over and above the
8
9
itemized estimate of the revenues to be received by this state made
9
10
by the State Board of Equalization or if a tax expenditure
10
11
limitation has been applied pursuant to paragraph 1 of this section,
11
12
any amount above the spending limit.
12
13
5. All such surplus funds or monies shall be placed in a
13
14
Constitutional Reserve Emergency Fund by the State Treasurer until
14
15
such time that the amount of said Fund equals fifteen percent (15%)
15
16
five percent (5%) of the General Revenue Fund certification for the
16
17
General Revenue Fund and all revenue funds appropriated directly by
17
18
the Legislature for the preceding fiscal year. Any interest income
18
19
earned on the balance of the Constitutional Emergency Fund shall
19
20
accrue to the fund and shall be included in the fund total.
20
21
Appropriations made from said Fund shall be considered special
21
22
appropriations made only upon declaration by the Governor that
22
23
emergency conditions exist, with concurrence of the Legislature by a
23
24
two-thirds (2/3) vote of the Senate and the House of Representatives
24
Req. No. 1073 Page 7

1
for appropriation. For purposes of this paragraph, “emergency” is
1
2
defined as an extraordinary event or occurrence that could not have
2
3
been reasonably foreseen or prevented and that requires immediate
3
4
expenditures to preserve the health, safety, and general welfare of
4
5
the people; provided, emergency shall not include a revenue or
5
6
budget shortfall.
6
7
6. a. Up to three-eighths (3/8) of the balance at the
7
8
beginning of the current fiscal year in the
8
9
Constitutional Reserve Fund may be appropriated for
9
10
the forthcoming fiscal year, when the certification by
10
11
the State Board of Equalization for said forthcoming
11
12
fiscal year General Revenue Fund is less than that of
12
13
the current fiscal year certification. In no event
13
14
shall the amount of monies appropriated from the
14
15
Constitutional Reserve Fund be in excess of the
15
16
difference between the two said certifications.
16
17
b. (1) In years when the provisions of subparagraph a of
17
18
this paragraph are not applicable and the balance
18
19
at the beginning of the current fiscal year in
19
20
the Constitutional Reserve Fund is equal to or
20
21
greater than Eighty Million Dollars
21
22
($80,000,000.00), up to Ten Million Dollars
22
23
($10,000,000.00) may be expended for the purpose
23
24
of providing incentives to support retention of
24
Req. No. 1073 Page 8

1
at-risk manufacturing establishments in this
1
2
state in order to retain employment for residents
2
3
of this state. Such incentives shall be paid by
3
4
the Oklahoma Tax Commission upon a unanimous
4
5
finding by the Governor, the Speaker of the House
5
6
of Representatives and the President Pro Tempore
6
7
of the Senate that:
7
8
(a) such incentives have been recommended by an
8
9
independent committee created by the
9
10
Legislature for such purposes as provided
10
11
herein pursuant to criteria set out by law,
11
12
(b) the incentive will result in a substantial
12
13
benefit to this state, and
13
14
(c) payment of the incentive would be in
14
15
accordance with the provisions of this
15
16
subparagraph and laws enacted to implement
16
17
provisions of this subparagraph.
17
18
(2) The independent committee will be composed of not
18
19
less than seven (7) people appointed or otherwise
19
20
determined pursuant to laws enacted by the
20
21
Legislature providing for membership on the
21
22
committee. The committee shall make
22
23
recommendations to the Governor, the Speaker of
23
24
the House of Representatives and the President
24
Req. No. 1073 Page 9

1
Pro Tempore of the Senate for the awarding of
1
2
incentives. Such recommendations shall give
2
3
priority to establishments which:
3
4
(a) are at greater risk of losing jobs because
4
5
the plant is no longer competitive or
5
6
leaving the state and thereby causing the
6
7
loss of more employment in this state than
7
8
other eligible recipients, and
8
9
(b) provide the largest economic impact to the
9
10
state.
10
11
(3) For any fiscal year, the incentives shall not
11
12
exceed ten percent (10%) of the amount invested
12
13
by an establishment in capital assets to be
13
14
utilized in this state. Incentives may only be
14
15
paid pursuant to an investment contract between
15
16
the establishment and a state agency designated
16
17
by law, which provides for a specified amount of
17
18
investment in a capital asset to be made by the
18
19
establishment over a period of not to exceed five
19
20
(5) years. No incentive payment shall be made
20
21
prior to the actual investment by the
21
22
establishment. The contract shall make payment
22
23
of any incentives in any fiscal year contingent
23
24
on the balance at the beginning of such fiscal
24
Req. No. 1073 Page 10

1
year in the Constitutional Reserve Fund being
1
2
equal to or greater than Eighty Million Dollars
2
3
($80,000,000.00) and on the certification by the
3
4
State Board of Equalization for such fiscal year
4
5
of the amount available for appropriation from
5
6
the General Revenue Fund being greater than the
6
7
amount certified for the preceding fiscal year.
7
8
Investment contracts authorized by this
8
9
subparagraph shall provide that if any incentive
9
10
payment is payable during a fiscal year in which
10
11
either the balance at the beginning of the fiscal
11
12
year in the Constitutional Reserve Fund is not
12
13
equal to or greater than Eighty Million Dollars
13
14
($80,000,000.00) or when the certification by the
14
15
State Board of Equalization for such fiscal year
15
16
General Revenue Fund is less than that of the
16
17
immediately prior fiscal year certification, then
17
18
any incentive payments which would have been
18
19
payable during such fiscal year shall be payable
19
20
in the first fiscal year when funds are available
20
21
pursuant to the provisions of division (1) of
21
22
this subparagraph. In the event that the amount
22
23
of incentives payable under investment contracts
23
24
authorized by this subparagraph is greater than
24
Req. No. 1073 Page 11

1
the amounts available for payment under this
1
2
subparagraph in a fiscal year, then no new
2
3
contracts may be authorized during such year and
3
4
incentive payments which are made shall be
4
5
reduced pro rata as necessary to apply all
5
6
available funds to incentive payments which are
6
7
payable in such year.
7
8
(4) The Legislature is authorized to enact laws
8
9
necessary to implement the provisions of this
9
10
section.
10
11
7. Up to three-eighths (3/8) of the balance at the beginning of
11
12
the current fiscal year in the Constitutional Reserve Fund may be
12
13
appropriated for the current fiscal year if the State Board of
13
14
Equalization determines that a revenue failure has occurred with
14
15
respect to the General Revenue Fund of the State Treasury. In no
15
16
event shall the amount of monies appropriated from the
16
17
Constitutional Reserve Fund pursuant to this paragraph be in excess
17
18
of the amount of the projected revenue failure in the General
18
19
Revenue Fund, which total amount shall be computed by the State
19
20
Board of Equalization, for the entire fiscal year. Monies
20
21
appropriated to any state governmental entity from the
21
22
Constitutional Reserve Fund pursuant to this paragraph may only be
22
23
made in order to ensure that the monies actually received by the

15
16
interest on the public debt, be allocated monthly to each
16
17
department, institution, board, commission or special appropriation

on a percentage basis, in that ratio that the total appropriation

19
for such department, institution, board, commission or special
19
20
appropriation from each fund for that fiscal year bears to the total
20
21
of all appropriations from each fund for that fiscal year, and no

10. 9. The Legislature shall provide a method whereby
10
11
appropriations shall be divided and set up on a monthly, quarterly
11
12
or semiannual basis within each fiscal year to prevent obligations
12
13
being incurred in excess of the revenue to be collected, and
13
14
notwithstanding other provisions of this Constitution, the
14
15
Legislature shall provide that all appropriations shall be reduced
15
16
to bring them within revenues actually collected, but all such
16
17
reductions shall apply to each department, institution, board,
17
18
commission or special appropriation made by the State Legislature in
18
19
the ratio that its total appropriation for that fiscal year bears to
19
20
the total of all appropriations from that fund for that fiscal year;
20
21
provided, however, that the Governor shall have discretion to issue
21
22
deficiency certificates to the State Treasurer for the benefit of
22
23
any department, institution or agency of the state, if the amount of
23
24
such deficiency certificates be within the limit of the current
24
Req. No. 1073 Page 16

1
appropriation for that department, institution or agency, whereupon
1
2
the State Treasurer shall issue warrants to the extent of such
2
3
certificates for the payment of such claims as may be authorized by
3
4
the Governor, and such warrants shall become a part of the public
4
5
debt and shall be paid out of any money appropriated by the
5
6
Legislature and made lawfully available therefor; provided further,
6
7
that in no event shall said deficiency certificates exceed in the
7
8
aggregate the sum of Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000.00) in
8
9
any fiscal year.

15
THE GIST OF THE PROPOSITION IS AS FOLLOWS:
15
16
This measure amends Section 23 of Article 10 of the Oklahoma
16
17
Constitution. It sets limits on growth in state revenue and
17
18
spending. It changes the way the State Board of Equalization
18
19
figures how much can be spent. The Board would set a tax
19
20
expenditure limit. The limit would set how much state spending
20
21
could go up from year to year. Revenue above a certain amount
21
22
would become surplus. A certain amount of surplus funds would
22
23
go into a Constitutional Emergency Fund. Money from that fund
23
24
could only be spent under certain conditions. Revenue in the
24
Req. No. 1073 Page 17

1
Constitutional Emergency Fund above a certain amount would be
1
2
deposited into a Budget Stabilization Fund. A part of that fund
2
3
could be spent only if a revenue failure exists. Once the
3
4
Budget Stabilization Fund has reached a certain level, some
4
5
revenue would be refunded to taxpayers. The Board could not
5
6
spend over the tax expenditure limitation without voter
6
7
approval.
