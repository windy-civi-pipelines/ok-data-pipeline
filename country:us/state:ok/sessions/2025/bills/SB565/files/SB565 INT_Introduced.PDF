10
has been previously registered in the debtor’s name and on which all

4
5
place on a vehicle, motor license agents shall be prohibited from
5
6
transferring the certificate of title on that vehicle until the lien
6
7
is satisfied, except when the title is transferred:
7
8
a. to a person whose name is included on the loan for
8
9
which the lien is placed pursuant to an agreement by
9
10
the lender and any party to the title,
10
11
b. to a trust created by a person whose name is included
11
12
on the loan for which the lien is placed, or
12
13
c. from a person who has died, upon the submission of a

15
16
ownership, to a business entity from a person who owns
16
17
at least fifty percent (50%) of the business entity
17
18

18
19
business entity receiving title and at the discretion
19
20
of the financial institution holding the lien, the
20
21
individual transferring title and the receiving
21
22
business entity may be added as an obligor to the
22
23
original note secured by the collateral to which the
23
24
transferring individual is a borrower. This shall not
24
Req. No. 1187 Page 6

1
be construed to require refinancing of the original
1
2
note. Service Oklahoma shall provide notification of
2
3
the transaction to the lienholder, ninety (90) days
3
4
prior to effectuating the title transfer and shall
4
5
develop an appropriate affidavit and notice necessary
5
6
to effectuate a transfer of title. A title transfer
6
7
initiated pursuant to this subparagraph shall not
7
8
preclude the lienholder from exercising all remedies
8
9
available to it in accordance with an agreement
9
10
between the lienholder and the individual transferring
10
11
title, up to and including repossession of the vehicle
11
12
and civil action against the individual transferring
12
13
title and receiving business entity. Further, until
13
14
the original lien is satisfied, the receiving business
14
15
entity shall be prohibited from transferring title to
15
16
another entity or person. Types of business entities
16
17
that may receive a transfer of title pursuant to this
17
18
subparagraph shall be limited to:
18
19
(1) sole proprietorships,
19
20
(2) general partnerships,
20
21
(3) limited partnerships,
21

No individual may perform a transfer, pursuant to this
1
2
subparagraph, to any business entity that is currently
2
3
engaging in any activity which is prohibited by federal or
3
4
state law.
4
5
The provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to release
5
6
any lien or debt based solely upon a transfer of certificate of
6
7
title.

B. 1. A secured party shall, within seven (7) business days
8
9
after the satisfaction of the security interest, furnish directly or
9
10
by mail a release of a security interest to the Tax Commission and
10
11
mail a copy thereof to the last-known address of the debtor. If the
11
12
security interest has been satisfied by payment from a licensed used
12
13
motor vehicle dealer to whom the motor vehicle has been transferred,
13
14
the secured party shall also, within seven (7) business days after
14
15
such satisfaction receipt of a written request from such licensed
15
16
used motor vehicle dealer, mail an additional copy of the release to
16
17
the dealer. If the secured party fails to furnish the release as
17
18
required, the secured party shall be liable to the debtor for a
18
19
penalty of One Hundred Dollars ($100.00). Following the seven (7)
19
20
business days after satisfaction of the lien and upon receipt by the
20
21
lienholder of written communication demanding the release of the
21
22
lien, thereafter the penalty shall increase to One Hundred Dollars
22
23
($100.00) per day for each additional day beyond seven (7) business
23
24
days until accumulating to One Thousand Five Hundred Dollars
24
Req. No. 1187 Page 8

1
($1,500.00) or the value of the vehicle, whichever is less, and, in
1
2
addition, any loss caused to the debtor by such failure.
2
3
2. Upon release of a security interest the owner may obtain a
3
4
new certificate of title omitting reference to the security
4
5
interest, by submitting to the Tax Commission or to a motor license
5
6
agent:
6
7
a. a release signed by the secured party, an application
7
8
for new certificate of title and the proper fees, or
8
9
b. by submitting to the Tax Commission or the motor
9
10
license agent an affidavit, supported by such
10
11
documentation as the Tax Commission may require, by
11
12
the owner on a form prescribed by the Tax Commission
12
13
stating that the security interest has been satisfied
13
14
and stating the reasons why a release cannot be
14
15
obtained, an application for a new certificate of
15
16
title and the proper fees.
16
17
Upon receiving such affidavit that the security interest has been
17
18
satisfied, the Tax Commission shall issue a new certificate of title
18
19
eliminating the satisfied security interest and the name and address
19
20
of the secured parties who have been paid and satisfied. The Tax
20
21
Commission shall accept a release of a security interest in any form
21
22
that identifies the debtor, the secured party, and the vehicle, and
22
23
contains the signature of the secured party. The Tax Commission
23
24
24
Req. No. 1187 Page 9

1
shall not require any particular form for the release of a security
1
2
interest.
2
3
The words “security interest” when used in the Oklahoma Vehicle
3
4
License and Registration Act do not include liens dependent upon
4
5
possession.
5
6
C. The Tax Commission shall file and index certificates of
6
7
title so that at all times it will be possible to trace a
7
8
certificate of title to the vehicle designated therein, identify the
8
9
lien entry form, and the names and addresses of secured parties, or
9
10
their assignees, so that all or any part of such information may be
10
11
made readily available to those who make legitimate inquiry of the
11
12
Tax Commission as to the existence or nonexistence of security
12
13
interest in the vehicle.
13
14
D. 1. Any security interest in a vehicle properly perfected
14
15
prior to July 1, 1979, may be continued as to its effectiveness or
15
16
duration as provided by Sections 1-9-510 and 1-9-515 of Title 12A of
16
17
the Oklahoma Statutes, or may be terminated, assigned or released as
17
18
provided by Sections 1-9-512, 1-9-513 and 1-9-514 of Title 12A of
18
19
the Oklahoma Statutes, as fully as if this section had not been
19
20
enacted, or, at the option of the secured party, may also be
20
21
perfected under this section, and, if so perfected, the time of
21
22
perfection under this section shall be the date the security
22
23
interest was originally perfected under the prior law.
23
24
24
Req. No. 1187 Page 10

1
2. Upon request of the secured party, the debtor, or any other
1
2
holder of the certificate of title shall surrender the certificate
2
3
of title to the secured party and shall do such other acts as may be
3
4
required to perfect the security interest under this section.
4
5
E. If a manufactured home is permanently affixed to real
5
6
estate, an Oklahoma certificate of title may be surrendered to the
6
7
Tax Commission or a motor license agent for cancellation. When the
7
8
document of title is surrendered, the owner shall provide the legal
8
9
description or the appropriate tract or parcel number of the real
9
10
estate and other information as may be required on a form provided
10
11
by the Tax Commission. The Tax Commission may not cancel a document
11
12
of title if a lien has been registered or recorded. The Tax
12
13
Commission or motor license agent shall notify the owner and any
13
14
lienholder that the title has been surrendered to the Tax Commission
14
15
and that the Tax Commission may not cancel the title until the lien
15
16
is released. Such notification shall include a description of the
16
17
lien and such notification to the owner shall be accompanied by the
17
18
return of title surrendered. Permanent attachment to real estate
18
19
does not affect the validity of a lien recorded or registered with
19
20
the Tax Commission before the document of title is canceled pursuant
20
21
to this section. The rights of a prior lienholder pursuant to a
21
22
security agreement or the provisions of a credit transaction and the
22
23
rights of the state pursuant to a tax lien are preserved. The Tax
23
24
Commission or motor license agent shall forward the information to
24
Req. No. 1187 Page 11

1
the county assessor of the county where the real estate is located
1
2
and indicate whether the original document of title has been
2
3
canceled. A fee of Five Dollars ($5.00) shall accompany the
3
4
application for cancellation of title. When the fee is paid by a
4
5
person making an application directly with the Tax Commission, the
5
6
fee shall be deposited in the Oklahoma Tax Commission Revolving
6
7
Fund. A fee paid to a motor license agent shall be retained by the
7
8
agent. The owner of a manufactured home upon which the document of
8
9
title has been properly surrendered, may apply to the Tax Commission
9
10
for issuance of a new original certificate of title upon submission
10
11
of:
11
12
1. An attestation from the homeowner indicating ownership of
12
13
the manufactured home and the nonexistence of any security interest
13
14
or lien of record in the manufactured home; and
14
15
2. A title opinion by a licensed attorney, determining that the
15
16
owner of the manufactured home has marketable title to the real
16
17
property upon which the manufactured home is located and that no
17
18
documents filed of record in the county clerk’s office concerning
18
19
the real property contain a mortgage, recorded financial statement,
19
20
judgment, or lien of record. Persons or entities to whom the title
20
21
opinion is addressed may rely on the title opinion. A security
21
22
interest in a manufactured home perfected pursuant to this section
22
23
shall have priority over a conflicting interest of a mortgagee or
23
24
other lien encumbrancer, or the owner of the real property upon
24
Req. No. 1187 Page 12

1
which the manufactured home became affixed or otherwise permanently
1
2
attached. The holder of the security interest in the manufactured
2
3
home, upon default, may remove the manufactured home from such real
3
4
property. The holder of the security interest in the manufactured
4
5
home shall reimburse the owner of the real property who is not the
5
6
debtor and who has not otherwise agreed to access the real property
6
7
for the cost of repair of any physical injury to the real property,
7
8
but shall not be liable for any diminution in value to the real
8
9
property caused by the removal of the manufactured home, trespass,
9
10
or any other damages caused by the removal. The debtor shall notify
10
11
the holder of the security interest in the manufactured home of the
11
12
street address, if any, and the legal description of the real
12
13
property upon which the manufactured home is affixed or otherwise
13
14
permanently attached and shall sign such other documents, including
14
15
any appropriate mortgage, as may reasonably be requested by the
15
16
holder of such security interest.
16
17
F. In the case of motor vehicles or trailers, notwithstanding
17
18
any other provision of law, a transaction does not create a sale or
18
19
security interest merely because it provides that the rental price
19
20
is permitted or required to be adjusted under the agreement either
20
21
upward or downward by reference to the amount realized upon sale or
21
22
other disposition of the motor vehicle or trailer.
22
23
G. A security interest in vehicles registered by a federally
23
24
recognized Indian tribe shall be deemed valid under Oklahoma law if
24
Req. No. 1187 Page 13

1
validly perfected under the applicable tribal law and the lien is
1
2
noted on the face of the tribal certificate of title.

SECTION 2. This act shall become effective November 1, 2025.
