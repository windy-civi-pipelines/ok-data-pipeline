6 remaining without benefit of any additional credits. No owner of a

15 grounds therefor. However, the Tax Commission Service Oklahoma or

6 application, when a licensed truck-tractor has been destroyed by
7 fire or accident, shall credit the unused portion of the annual
8 license fee of the vehicle toward the license fee of a replacement
9 vehicle of equal registered weight. The amount of credit shall not
10 exceed the license fee due on the replacement vehicle. The Tax
11 Commission Service Oklahoma or the Corporation Commission shall not
12 be required to make a refund. If the replacement vehicle is to be
13 registered at a greater weight, the applicant shall pay an
14 additional sum equivalent to the difference between the unused
15 portion of the annual license fee for the original motor vehicle and
16 the license fee due for the replacement motor vehicle.
17 G. The license fees provided for in this section shall be paid
18 each year whether or not the vehicle is operated on the public

9 vehicle of equal registered weight. The amount of credit shall not
10 exceed the license fee due on the replacement vehicle. The Tax
11 Commission Service Oklahoma or the Corporation Commission shall not
12 be required to make a refund. If the replacement vehicle is to be
13 registered at a greater weight, the applicant shall pay an

19 vehicle involved shall be considered as improperly licensed and as
20 not currently registered, and all of the provisions of the Oklahoma
