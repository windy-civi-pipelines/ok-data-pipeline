commercial trailer, or semitrailer. The fee of Four Dollars ($4.00)
shall be due and payable on January 1 of each year on any frac tank,
construction machinery, rental trailer, commercial trailer, or
semitrailer registered under this section.
Upon the payment of the registration fee of Forty Dollars
($40.00), a nonexpiring registration certificate and identification
plate shall be issued for each frac tank, construction machinery,
rental trailer, commercial trailer, or semitrailer. The nonexpiring
identification plate shall remain displayed on the frac tank,
construction machinery, rental trailer, commercial trailer, or
semitrailer for which the identification plate is issued until such
frac tank, construction machinery, trailer, or semitrailer is sold
or removed from service.
A receipt shall be issued upon the payment of the annual fee.
The receipt shall show the total fee paid for one or more frac

and shall be subject to audit by the Tax Commission Service Oklahoma

Any frac tank, construction machinery, commercial trailer, or
semitrailer licensed pursuant to this section shall not be permitted
to be operated on the highways of this state when such frac tank,
construction machinery, commercial trailer, or semitrailer is being
operated by a resident of this state, or is being operated by a
person operating a vehicle or vehicles domiciled in this state and
required by law to be licensed in Oklahoma, unless the pulling truck
or truck-tractor has been licensed pursuant to this section or is
twenty-four thousand (24,000) pounds or less and operating under a
valid temporary license plate provided by Section 1137.1 or 1137.3
of this title. In no event shall any truck, truck-tractor, frac
tank, construction machinery, trailer, or semitrailer used in the
furtherance of any commercial enterprise be permitted to operate on
the highways of this state or register at a smaller license fee than
that prescribed in this section except as provided in this section.
D. For each fiscal year, notwithstanding the provisions of

Section 322:
Section 1104 of this title, the first Four Hundred Thousand Dollars
ENR. S. B. NO. 1108 Page 87
($400,000.00) of all monies collected pursuant to subsections A, B,
and C of this section shall be paid by the Tax Commission Service
Oklahoma to the State Treasurer of the State of Oklahoma who shall
deposit same each fiscal year, or such lesser amount as may accrue
each fiscal year, under the provisions of this section to the credit
of the General Revenue Fund of the State Treasury. All monies
collected in excess of Four Hundred Thousand Dollars ($400,000.00)
each fiscal year shall be apportioned as provided in Section 1104 of
this title.
E. If any vehicle is used for a purpose other than that for
which it has been registered, the owner of the vehicle shall be
required to immediately reregister the vehicle at the appropriate
rate. If any vehicle is placed or operated upon any street, road,
or highway of this state with a laden weight in excess of that for
which it is licensed, the license fee for such increased laden
weight shall become due, and the owner of the vehicle shall be
required to immediately reregister the vehicle at the increased
rate. Provided, that in either event there shall be credited upon
the increased license fee for such reregistration for any portion of
the year or period remaining after the change in use or increase in
laden weight shall have occurred a proportionate part of the license
fees previously paid. If this reregistration is made voluntarily by
the owner, the ratable proportion of the credit allowed shall be
determined as of the date the reregistration is voluntarily made.
If the reregistration is not voluntarily made but occurs as a result
of the discovery by any enforcement officer of an improper operation
of the vehicle, that shall be considered prima facie evidence that
it has been improperly registered for the entire portion of the year
covered by the improper registration. Provided further, that the
ratable credit shall be allowed only on the first reregistration of
any vehicle during any calendar year. If, during the calendar year,
subsequent changes of license plate are desired, the ratable credit
shall not be allowed but the owner of the vehicle shall be required
to pay the license fee due for that portion of the calendar year
remaining without benefit of any additional credits. No owner of a
motor vehicle shall possess at any time more than one license plate
for any vehicle owned by such person. No reregistration shall be
made until the current license plate previously issued has been
surrendered.
ENR. S. B. NO. 1108 Page 88
Any person who has paid a fee under the terms and provisions of
this subsection may at any time within one (1) year after the
payment of such fee file with the Tax Commission Service Oklahoma or
the Corporation Commission a claim under oath for refund stating the
grounds therefor. However, the Tax Commission Service Oklahoma or
the Corporation Commission shall allow refunds only where the amount
of tax paid has been erroneously computed or determined through
clerical errors or miscalculations. No refund shall be allowed by
the Tax Commission Service Oklahoma or the Corporation Commission of
a tax paid by the person where such payment is made through a
mistake as to the legal misinterpretation or construction of the
provisions of this section. Any refunds made by the Tax Commission
Service Oklahoma or the Corporation Commission pursuant to this
subsection shall be made out of any monies collected pursuant to
this subsection and which have not been apportioned.
F. The annual license fee required by this section is intended
to cover only the motor vehicle for which it is issued. The Tax
Commission Service Oklahoma or the Corporation Commission upon
application, when a licensed truck-tractor has been destroyed by
fire or accident, shall credit the unused portion of the annual
license fee of the vehicle toward the license fee of a replacement
vehicle of equal registered weight. The amount of credit shall not
exceed the license fee due on the replacement vehicle. The Tax
Commission Service Oklahoma or the Corporation Commission shall not
be required to make a refund. If the replacement vehicle is to be
registered at a greater weight, the applicant shall pay an
additional sum equivalent to the difference between the unused
portion of the annual license fee for the original motor vehicle and
the license fee due for the replacement motor vehicle.
G. The license fees provided for in this section shall be paid
each year whether or not the vehicle is operated on the public
highway.
H. Notwithstanding the provision of any other statute in
respect to the time for payment of license fees on motor vehicles,
if the total amount of the annual license fees due from any resident
owner, either individual, partnership, or Oklahoma corporation, upon
the registration, on or before January 15 of any year, of commercial
trucks, truck-tractors, frac tanks, construction machinery, trailers
or semitrailers exceeds the sum of One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00),
ENR. S. B. NO. 1108 Page 89
the license fees may be paid in equal semiannual installments. The
first installment shall be paid at the time of the application for
registration of the vehicles and not later than January 15 of each
year, and the second installment shall be paid on or before the
first day of July of such year.
This subsection shall not operate to reduce the amount of the
license fees due. If any installment is not paid on or before the
date due, all unpaid installments of license fees for such year on
each vehicle shall be deemed delinquent and immediately due and
payable, and there shall be added a penalty of twenty-five cents
($0.25) per day to the balance of the license fee due on each
vehicle for each day the balance remains unpaid up to thirty (30)
days, after which the penalty due on each vehicle shall be Twenty-
five Dollars ($25.00). The penalty for vehicles registered by
weight in excess of eight thousand (8,000) pounds shall be an amount
equal to the license fee. On and after the thirtieth day each such
vehicle involved shall be considered as improperly licensed and as
not currently registered, and all of the provisions of the Oklahoma
Vehicle License and Registration Act relating to enforcement,
including the provisions for the seizure and sale of vehicles not
registered and not displaying current license plates, shall apply to
the vehicles.
All fees and taxes levied by the Oklahoma Vehicle License and
Registration Act shall become and remain a first lien upon the
vehicle upon which the fees or taxes are due until paid. The lien
shall have priority to all other liens. No title to any vehicle may
be transferred until the unpaid balance on the vehicle has been paid
in full. Provided, that any unpaid balance of the license fees
shall remain and become a lien against any and all property of the
owner, both real and personal, for so long as any license tag fee
balance shall remain unpaid. Any unpaid balance under these
provisions shall be immediately due and payable by the owner if any
vehicle is sold, wrecked, or otherwise retired from service.
Any person electing to pay license fees on a semiannual
installment basis, as herein authorized, shall be required to
purchase a new license tag for the last half and shall pay the sum
of Four Dollars ($4.00) for each tag to cover the costs of the
license tags. The license tags for each half shall be plainly
marked in designating the half for which they were issued. A
ENR. S. B. NO. 1108 Page 90
validation sticker may be used in lieu of a metal tag where
appropriate. Such license tag fee shall be, in addition to the
license fees or any other fees, collected on each application as
provided by statute and shall be apportioned according to the
provisions of Section 1104 of this title.
I. Any person pulling or towing any vehicle intended to be
resold, into or through this state, shall pay a fee of Three Dollars
($3.00) for the vehicle towing and Three Dollars ($3.00) for the one
being towed. It shall be unlawful to operate any series of such
units on the public highways of this state at a distance closer than
five hundred (500) feet from each other. All fees and taxes levied
by the terms and provisions of this section shall become and remain
a first lien upon the vehicle upon which the fees or taxes are due
until paid. The lien shall be prior, superior, and paramount to all
other liens of whatsoever kind or character.
J. In addition to any other penalties prescribed by law, the
following penalty shall be imposed by enforcement officers upon any
owner or operator of a commercial vehicle registered under the
provisions of this section when the laden weight or combined laden
weight of such vehicle is found to be in excess of that for which
registered. The penalty shall be imposed each and every time a
vehicle is found to be in violation of the registered laden weight
or combined laden weight.
The penalty shall be not less than Twenty Dollars ($20.00) when
such vehicle exceeds the laden weight or combined laden weight by
two thousand one (2,001) pounds; thereafter, an additional penalty
of not less than Twenty Dollars ($20.00) shall be imposed for each
additional one thousand (1,000) pounds or fraction thereof of weight
in excess of the registered laden weight or combined laden weight.
Such penalty shall not exceed the amount established by the
Corporation Commission pursuant to the provisions of subsection A of

Section 323:
Section 1167 of this title. Revenue from such penalties shall be
apportioned as provided in Section 1167 of this title.
K. Service Oklahoma shall promulgate rules for the mass renewal
of commercial vehicle registration for businesses that possess at
least ten vehicles registered as commercial vehicles under the
provisions of this section, provided that such mass renewal shall
not be mandatory for such businesses. For such mass renewal, the
ENR. S. B. NO. 1108 Page 91
annual license fees described in subsections A and B of this section
shall be due and payable on January 1 of each year on such
commercial vehicles.

on or under the licensed operator’s bond made to Service Oklahoma.
Unless provided otherwise, any licensed operator who fails to
comply with any provision of this section shall pay a penalty to be
imposed by Service Oklahoma. Monies collected for payment of the
penalty shall be deposited to the credit of the General Revenue Fund

pursuant to this section shall not allocate his or her payment
thereof as a part of his or her operating expenses, but shall use

receipts received by the licensed operator for that particular day
that the licensed operator fails to deposit all such funds required
by this section or one percent (1%) of the gross amount of the
receipts received by the licensed operator for the report period

Q. A seized vessel or motor or vessel or motor part that is
neither forfeited nor unidentifiable shall be held subject to the
order of the court in which the criminal action is pending or, if a
request for its release from such custody is made, until the
district attorney has notified the defendant or the defendant’s
attorney of such request and both the prosecution and defense have
been afforded a reasonable opportunity for an examination of the
property to determine its true value and to produce or reproduce, by
photographs or other identifying techniques, legally sufficient
evidence for introduction at trial or other criminal proceedings.

return of property as provided herein, the property shall be
released to the person making such request after satisfactory proof
of such person’s entitlement to the possession thereof.

justice.

operator issues the rebuilt title. A visual inspection shall also

of the inspection. The licensed operator may be held liable for any
damages to the vehicle caused by the negligent acts or omissions in
the performance of the inspection. Any person may be liable for any
damages to a vehicle caused by the intentional acts or omissions in
the performance of the inspection.

documented cost of repairing the vehicle for safe operation on the
highway does not exceed sixty percent (60%) of the fair market value
of the vehicle as provided by this section.
K. When the insurance company pays a loss on a vehicle which is
registered at the time of mishap, accident, burning, or flooding,
ENR. S. B. NO. 1108 Page 75

the appropriate certificate of title shall be issued without the
payment of additional registration fees or excise taxes, upon the

dealer. If the owner of the vehicle or other insured retains
ownership of the damaged vehicle, Service Oklahoma shall notify the
owner or insured of the requirements of this section.

ENR. S. B. NO. 1108 Page 86

commercial trailer, or semitrailer. The fee of Four Dollars ($4.00)
shall be due and payable on January 1 of each year on any frac tank,
construction machinery, rental trailer, commercial trailer, or
semitrailer registered under this section.
Upon the payment of the registration fee of Forty Dollars
($40.00), a nonexpiring registration certificate and identification
plate shall be issued for each frac tank, construction machinery,
rental trailer, commercial trailer, or semitrailer. The nonexpiring
identification plate shall remain displayed on the frac tank,
construction machinery, rental trailer, commercial trailer, or
semitrailer for which the identification plate is issued until such
frac tank, construction machinery, trailer, or semitrailer is sold

and shall be subject to audit by the Tax Commission Service Oklahoma

operated by a resident of this state, or is being operated by a
person operating a vehicle or vehicles domiciled in this state and
required by law to be licensed in Oklahoma, unless the pulling truck
or truck-tractor has been licensed pursuant to this section or is
twenty-four thousand (24,000) pounds or less and operating under a
valid temporary license plate provided by Section 1137.1 or 1137.3
of this title. In no event shall any truck, truck-tractor, frac

furtherance of any commercial enterprise be permitted to operate on
the highways of this state or register at a smaller license fee than
that prescribed in this section except as provided in this section.
D. For each fiscal year, notwithstanding the provisions of
Section 1104 of this title, the first Four Hundred Thousand Dollars
ENR. S. B. NO. 1108 Page 87

($400,000.00) of all monies collected pursuant to subsections A, B,
and C of this section shall be paid by the Tax Commission Service
Oklahoma to the State Treasurer of the State of Oklahoma who shall
deposit same each fiscal year, or such lesser amount as may accrue
each fiscal year, under the provisions of this section to the credit
of the General Revenue Fund of the State Treasury. All monies
collected in excess of Four Hundred Thousand Dollars ($400,000.00)
each fiscal year shall be apportioned as provided in Section 1104 of
this title.
E. If any vehicle is used for a purpose other than that for
which it has been registered, the owner of the vehicle shall be
required to immediately reregister the vehicle at the appropriate
rate. If any vehicle is placed or operated upon any street, road,
or highway of this state with a laden weight in excess of that for
which it is licensed, the license fee for such increased laden
weight shall become due, and the owner of the vehicle shall be
required to immediately reregister the vehicle at the increased
rate. Provided, that in either event there shall be credited upon
the increased license fee for such reregistration for any portion of
the year or period remaining after the change in use or increase in
laden weight shall have occurred a proportionate part of the license
fees previously paid. If this reregistration is made voluntarily by
the owner, the ratable proportion of the credit allowed shall be
determined as of the date the reregistration is voluntarily made.
If the reregistration is not voluntarily made but occurs as a result
of the discovery by any enforcement officer of an improper operation
of the vehicle, that shall be considered prima facie evidence that
it has been improperly registered for the entire portion of the year
covered by the improper registration. Provided further, that the
ratable credit shall be allowed only on the first reregistration of
any vehicle during any calendar year. If, during the calendar year,
subsequent changes of license plate are desired, the ratable credit
shall not be allowed but the owner of the vehicle shall be required
to pay the license fee due for that portion of the calendar year
remaining without benefit of any additional credits. No owner of a
motor vehicle shall possess at any time more than one license plate
for any vehicle owned by such person. No reregistration shall be
made until the current license plate previously issued has been
surrendered.
ENR. S. B. NO. 1108 Page 88

Any person who has paid a fee under the terms and provisions of
this subsection may at any time within one (1) year after the
payment of such fee file with the Tax Commission Service Oklahoma or
the Corporation Commission a claim under oath for refund stating the
grounds therefor. However, the Tax Commission Service Oklahoma or
the Corporation Commission shall allow refunds only where the amount
of tax paid has been erroneously computed or determined through
clerical errors or miscalculations. No refund shall be allowed by
the Tax Commission Service Oklahoma or the Corporation Commission of
a tax paid by the person where such payment is made through a
mistake as to the legal misinterpretation or construction of the
provisions of this section. Any refunds made by the Tax Commission
Service Oklahoma or the Corporation Commission pursuant to this
subsection shall be made out of any monies collected pursuant to
this subsection and which have not been apportioned.
F. The annual license fee required by this section is intended
to cover only the motor vehicle for which it is issued. The Tax
Commission Service Oklahoma or the Corporation Commission upon
application, when a licensed truck-tractor has been destroyed by
fire or accident, shall credit the unused portion of the annual
license fee of the vehicle toward the license fee of a replacement
vehicle of equal registered weight. The amount of credit shall not
exceed the license fee due on the replacement vehicle. The Tax
Commission Service Oklahoma or the Corporation Commission shall not
be required to make a refund. If the replacement vehicle is to be
registered at a greater weight, the applicant shall pay an
additional sum equivalent to the difference between the unused
portion of the annual license fee for the original motor vehicle and
the license fee due for the replacement motor vehicle.
G. The license fees provided for in this section shall be paid
each year whether or not the vehicle is operated on the public
highway.
H. Notwithstanding the provision of any other statute in
respect to the time for payment of license fees on motor vehicles,
if the total amount of the annual license fees due from any resident
owner, either individual, partnership, or Oklahoma corporation, upon
the registration, on or before January 15 of any year, of commercial
trucks, truck-tractors, frac tanks, construction machinery, trailers
or semitrailers exceeds the sum of One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00),
ENR. S. B. NO. 1108 Page 89

the license fees may be paid in equal semiannual installments. The
first installment shall be paid at the time of the application for
registration of the vehicles and not later than January 15 of each
year, and the second installment shall be paid on or before the
first day of July of such year.
This subsection shall not operate to reduce the amount of the
license fees due. If any installment is not paid on or before the
date due, all unpaid installments of license fees for such year on
each vehicle shall be deemed delinquent and immediately due and
payable, and there shall be added a penalty of twenty-five cents
($0.25) per day to the balance of the license fee due on each
vehicle for each day the balance remains unpaid up to thirty (30)
days, after which the penalty due on each vehicle shall be Twenty-
five Dollars ($25.00). The penalty for vehicles registered by
weight in excess of eight thousand (8,000) pounds shall be an amount
equal to the license fee. On and after the thirtieth day each such
vehicle involved shall be considered as improperly licensed and as
not currently registered, and all of the provisions of the Oklahoma
Vehicle License and Registration Act relating to enforcement,
including the provisions for the seizure and sale of vehicles not
registered and not displaying current license plates, shall apply to
the vehicles.
All fees and taxes levied by the Oklahoma Vehicle License and
Registration Act shall become and remain a first lien upon the
vehicle upon which the fees or taxes are due until paid. The lien
shall have priority to all other liens. No title to any vehicle may
be transferred until the unpaid balance on the vehicle has been paid
in full. Provided, that any unpaid balance of the license fees
shall remain and become a lien against any and all property of the
owner, both real and personal, for so long as any license tag fee
balance shall remain unpaid. Any unpaid balance under these
provisions shall be immediately due and payable by the owner if any
vehicle is sold, wrecked, or otherwise retired from service.
Any person electing to pay license fees on a semiannual
installment basis, as herein authorized, shall be required to
purchase a new license tag for the last half and shall pay the sum
of Four Dollars ($4.00) for each tag to cover the costs of the
license tags. The license tags for each half shall be plainly
marked in designating the half for which they were issued. A
ENR. S. B. NO. 1108 Page 90

validation sticker may be used in lieu of a metal tag where
appropriate. Such license tag fee shall be, in addition to the
license fees or any other fees, collected on each application as
provided by statute and shall be apportioned according to the
provisions of Section 1104 of this title.
I. Any person pulling or towing any vehicle intended to be
resold, into or through this state, shall pay a fee of Three Dollars
($3.00) for the vehicle towing and Three Dollars ($3.00) for the one
being towed. It shall be unlawful to operate any series of such
units on the public highways of this state at a distance closer than
five hundred (500) feet from each other. All fees and taxes levied
by the terms and provisions of this section shall become and remain
a first lien upon the vehicle upon which the fees or taxes are due
until paid. The lien shall be prior, superior, and paramount to all
other liens of whatsoever kind or character.
J. In addition to any other penalties prescribed by law, the
following penalty shall be imposed by enforcement officers upon any
owner or operator of a commercial vehicle registered under the
provisions of this section when the laden weight or combined laden
weight of such vehicle is found to be in excess of that for which
registered. The penalty shall be imposed each and every time a
vehicle is found to be in violation of the registered laden weight
or combined laden weight.
The penalty shall be not less than Twenty Dollars ($20.00) when
such vehicle exceeds the laden weight or combined laden weight by
two thousand one (2,001) pounds; thereafter, an additional penalty
of not less than Twenty Dollars ($20.00) shall be imposed for each
additional one thousand (1,000) pounds or fraction thereof of weight
in excess of the registered laden weight or combined laden weight.
Such penalty shall not exceed the amount established by the
Corporation Commission pursuant to the provisions of subsection A of
Section 1167 of this title. Revenue from such penalties shall be
apportioned as provided in Section 1167 of this title.
K. Service Oklahoma shall promulgate rules for the mass renewal
of commercial vehicle registration for businesses that possess at
least ten vehicles registered as commercial vehicles under the
provisions of this section, provided that such mass renewal shall
not be mandatory for such businesses. For such mass renewal, the
ENR. S. B. NO. 1108 Page 91

annual license fees described in subsections A and B of this section
shall be due and payable on January 1 of each year on such
commercial vehicles.
SECTION 47. AMENDATORY 47 O.S. 2021, Section 1134.4, as
amended by Section 159, Chapter 282, O.S.L. 2022 (47 O.S. Supp.

agency which seized it or some other agency designated
by the court, or

employing the seizing agency after deduction of any reasonable and
necessary towing and storage charges.
P. Seizing agencies shall utilize their best efforts to arrange
for the towing and storing of vessels or motors and vessel or motor
parts in the most economical manner possible. In no event shall the
owner of a vessel or motor or a vessel or motor part be required to
pay more than the minimum reasonable costs of towing and storage.
Q. A seized vessel or motor or vessel or motor part that is
neither forfeited nor unidentifiable shall be held subject to the
order of the court in which the criminal action is pending or, if a
request for its release from such custody is made, until the
district attorney has notified the defendant or the defendant’s
attorney of such request and both the prosecution and defense have
been afforded a reasonable opportunity for an examination of the
property to determine its true value and to produce or reproduce, by
photographs or other identifying techniques, legally sufficient
evidence for introduction at trial or other criminal proceedings.
Upon expiration of a reasonable time for the completion of the
examination, which in no event shall exceed fourteen (14) days from
the date of service upon the defense of the notice of request for
return of property as provided herein, the property shall be
released to the person making such request after satisfactory proof
of such person’s entitlement to the possession thereof.

justice.

Service Oklahoma shall issue a certificate of title, salvage
certificate for the vessel or motor upon receipt of the statutory
ENR. S. B. NO. 1108 Page 195

fee, properly executed application for a certificate of title, or
