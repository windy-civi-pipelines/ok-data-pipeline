SENATE FLOOR VERSION - SB1098 SFLR Page 11
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)

1 prev ailing rate or rates for additional loans or equity, and the

7 inconsistent with the duties, powers, and authority of the Board as
8 to valuation of the counties as fixed and defined by Section 21 of
9 Article X of the Oklahoma Constitution.

19 of the Tax Commission. The use value estimates for the
20 nonresidential improvements shall take obsolescence and depreciation
21 into consideration in addition to necessary adjustments for local
22 variations in the cost of labor and materials. This section shall

1 of t he counties as determined and defined by Section 21 of Article X
2 of the Oklahoma Constitution.
3 The use value of facilities used for poultry production shall be
4 determined according to the following procedures:
5 1. The Ad Valorem Division of the Tax Commission is hereby
6 directed to develop a standard system of valuation of both real and
7 personal property of such facilities, which shall be used by all
8 county assessors in this state, under which valuation based on the
9 following shall be presumed to be the fair cash value of the
10 property:
11 a. for real property, a ten-year depreciation schedule,
12 at the end of which the residual value is twenty
13 percent (20%) of the value of the facility during its
14 first year of operation, and
15 b. for personal property, a five-year depreciation
16 schedule, at the end of which the residual value is
17 zero;
18 2. Such facilities shall be valued only in comparison to other
19 facilities used exclusively for poultry production. Such a facility
20 which is no longer used for poultry production shall be deemed to
21 have no productive use;
22 3. During the first year such a facility is placed on the tax
23 rolls, its fair cash value shall be presumed to be the lesser of the
24
SENATE FLOOR VERSION - SB1098 SFLR Page 13
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)

1 actu al purchase price or the actual documented cost of construction;
2 and
3 4. For the purpose of determining the valuation of
4 nonresidential improvements used for poultry production, the
5 provisions of this subsection shall be applicable and such
6 improvements shall not be considered to be commercial property.
7 E. The value of investment in property used exclusively by an
8 oil refinery that is used wholly as a facility, device, or method
9 for the desulphurization of gasoline or diesel fuel as defined in
10 Section 2817.3 of this title shall not be included in the
11 capitalization used in the determination of fair market value of
12 such oil refinery if such property would qualify as exempt property
13 pursuant to Section 2902 of this title, whether or not an
14 application for such exemption is made by an otherwise qualifying
15 manufacturing concern owning the property described by Section
16 2817.3 of this title.
17 F. The use value of a lot in any platted addition or a
18 subdivision in a city, town, or county zoned for residential,
19 commercial, industrial, or other use shall be deemed to be the fair
20 cash value of the underlying tract of land platted, divided by the
21 number of lots contained in the platted addition or subdivision
22 until the lot shall have been conveyed to a bona fide purchaser or
23 the lot with building or buildings located thereon shall have been
24 occupied other than as a sales office by the owner thereof, or shall
SENATE FLOOR VERSION - SB1098 SFLR Page 14
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)

1 have been leased, whichever event shall first occur. One who
2 purchases a lot for the purposes of constructing and selling a
3 building on such lot shall not be deemed to be a bona fide purchaser
4 for purposes of this section. However, if the lot is held for a
5 period longer than two (2) years before construction, then the
6 assessor may consider the lot to have been conveyed to a bona fide
7 purchaser. The cost of any land or improvements to any real
8 property required to be dedicated to public use including, but not
9 limited to, streets, curbs, gutters, sidewalks, storm or sanitary
10 sewers, utilities, detention or retention ponds, easements, parks,
11 or reserves shall not be utilized by the county assessor in the
12 valuation of any real property for assessment purposes.
13 G. The transfer of real property without a change in its use
14 classification shall not require a reassessment thereof based
15 exclusively upon the sale value of the property. However, if the
16 county assessor determines:
17 1. That by reason of the transfer of a property there is a
18 change in the actual use or classification of the property; or
19 2. That by reason of the amount of the sales consideration it
20 is obvious that the use classification prior to the transfer of the
21 property is not commensurate with and would not justify the amount
22 of the sales consideration of the property;
23 then the assessor shall, in either event, reassess the property for
24 the new use classification for which the property is being used, or,
SENATE FLOOR VERSION - SB1098 SFLR Page 15
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)

1 the highest and best use classification for which the property may,
2 by reason of the transfer, be classified for use.
3 H. When the term “fair cash value” or the language “fair cash
4 value, estimated at the price it would bring at a fair voluntary
5 sale” is used in the Ad Valorem Tax Code, in connection with and in
6 relation to the assessment of real property, it is defined to mean
7 and shall be given the meaning ascribed and assigned to it in this
8 section and when the term or language is used in the Code in
9 connection with the assessment of personal property, it shall be
10 given its ordinary or literal meaning.
11 I. Where any real property is zoned for a use by a proper
12 zoning authority, and the use of the property has not been changed,
13 the use and not zoning shall determine assessment. Any reassessment
14 required shall be effective January 1 following the change in use.
15 Taxable real property need not be listed annually with the county
16 assessor.
17 J. If any real property shall become taxable after January 1 of
18 any year, the county assessor shall assess the same and place it
19 upon the tax rolls for the next ensuing year. When any building is
20 constructed upon land after January 1 of any year, the value of the
21 building shall be added by the county assessor to the assessed
22 valuation of the land upon which the building is constructed at the
23 fair cash value thereof for the next ensuing year. However, after
24 the building has been completed it shall be deemed to have a value
SENATE FLOOR VERSION - SB1098 SFLR Page 16
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)

1 for assessment purposes of the fair cash value of the materials used
2 in such building only, until the building and the land on which the
3 building is located shall have been conveyed to a bona fide
4 purchaser or shall have been occupied or used for any purpose other
5 than as a sales office by the owner thereof, or shall have been
6 leased, whichever event shall first occur. The county assessor
7 shall continue to assess the building based upon the fair market
8 value of the materials used therein until the building and land upon
9 which the building is located shall have been conveyed to a bona
10 fide purchaser or is occupied or used for any purpose other than as
11 a sales office by the owner thereof, or is leased, whichever event
12 shall first occur. In the event a building or buildings described
13 by this subsection are intended to serve primarily as residential
14 rental housing, after the building or buildings have been completed
15 they shall be deemed to have an initial value for assessment
16 purposes not to exceed the fair cash value of the land and the
17 actual documented cost of any improvements made to the building or
18 buildings. The county assessor shall continue to assess such
19 building or buildings at a value not to exceed the fair cash value
20 of the land and actual documented cost of any improvements made
21 until either one (1) year has passed since the date on which the
22 building or buildings were first reflected on the tax rolls, or the
23 building or buildings and the land on which the building or
24

2 purchaser, whichever event shall first occur.
3 K. In the event improvements on land or personal property
4 located therein or thereon are destroyed or partially destroyed, or
5 the land itself is impaired or partially impaired by fire,
6 lightning, storm, winds, floodwaters, overflow of streams, or other
7 cause (all such destruction or impairments being referred to herein
8 as “damage”) during any year, the county assessor shall determine
9 the amount of damage and shall reassess the property for that year
10 at the fair cash value of the property, taking into account the
11 actual loss of functional use of the property occasioned by such
12 damage. The assessor shall make the appropriate value adjustments
13 to the property for that tax year up to the time at which the
14 assessor publishes the “Assessor’s assessor’s Report to the Excise
15 Board” Board as required by subsection D of Section 2867 of this
16 title. After such time, adjustments can be made only by the county
17 board of tax roll corrections and only after the assessor has
18 certified the tax roll for that year. The board secretary shall
19 notify property owners in advance of the time and place at which the
20 value adjustment to their property will be heard by the board. The
21 board of tax roll corrections is authorized only to approve or
22 reject the value adjustment submitted by the county assessor.
