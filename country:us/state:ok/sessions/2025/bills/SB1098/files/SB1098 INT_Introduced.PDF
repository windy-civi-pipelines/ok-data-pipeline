1. That by reason of the transfer of a property there is a
17
18
change in the actual use or classification of the property; or
18
19

Section 64:
2. That by reason of the amount of the sales consideration it
19
20
is obvious that the use classification prior to the transfer of the
20
21
property is not commensurate with and would not justify the amount
21
22
of the sales consideration of the property;
22
23
then the assessor shall, in either event, reassess the property for
23
24
the new use classification for which the property is being used, or,
24
Req. No. 387 Page 15

11
I. Where any real property is zoned for a use by a proper

14
required shall be effective January 1 following the change in use.
14
15
Taxable real property need not be listed annually with the county
15
16
assessor.
16
17
J. If any real property shall become taxable after January 1 of
17
18
any year, the county assessor shall assess the same and place it
18
19
upon the tax rolls for the next ensuing year. When any building is
19
20
constructed upon land after January 1 of any year, the value of the
20
21
building shall be added by the county assessor to the assessed
21
22
valuation of the land upon which the building is constructed at the
22
23
fair cash value thereof for the next ensuing year. However, after

3
4
purchaser or shall have been occupied or used for any purpose other

shall first occur. In the event a building or buildings described
12
13
by this subsection are intended to serve primarily as residential
13
14
rental housing, after the building or buildings have been completed
14
15
they shall be deemed to have an initial value for assessment
15
16
purposes not to exceed the fair cash value of the land and the
16
17
actual documented cost of any improvements made to the building or
17
18
buildings. The county assessor shall continue to assess such
18
19
building or buildings at a value not to exceed the fair cash value

the land itself is impaired or partially impaired by fire,
5
6
lightning, storm, winds, floodwaters, overflow of streams, or other

7
cause (all such destruction or impairments being referred to herein
7
8
as “damage”) during any year, the county assessor shall determine
8
9
the amount of damage and shall reassess the property for that year
9
10
at the fair cash value of the property, taking into account the
10
11
actual loss of functional use of the property occasioned by such
11
12
damage. The assessor shall make the appropriate value adjustments
12

11
12
bring at a fair voluntary sale for:
12
13
1. The highest and best use for which the property was actually
13
14
used during the preceding calendar year; or
14
15
2. The highest and best use for which the property was last
15
16
classified for use if not actually used during the preceding
16
17
calendar year.
17
18
When improvements upon residential real property are divided by
18
19
a taxing jurisdiction line, those improvements shall be valued and
19
20
assessed in the taxing jurisdiction in which the physical majority
20
21
of those improvements are located.
21
22
The Ad Valorem Division of the Oklahoma Tax Commission shall be
22
23
responsible for the promulgation of rules which shall be followed by
23
24
each county assessor of the state, for the purposes of providing for
24
Req. No. 387 Page 10

1
the equitable use valuation of locally assessed real property in
1
2
this state. Agricultural land and nonresidential improvements
2
3
necessary or convenient for agricultural purposes shall be assessed
3
4
for ad valorem taxation based upon the highest and best use for
4
5
which the property was actually used, or was previously classified
5
6
for use, during the calendar year next preceding January 1 on which
6
7
the assessment is made.
7
8
C. The use value of agricultural land shall be based on the
8
9
income capitalization approach using cash rent. The rental income
9
10
shall be calculated using the direct capitalization method based
10
11
upon factors including, but not limited to:
11
12
1. Soil types, as depicted on soil maps published by the
12
13
Natural Resources Conservation Service of the United States
13
14
Department of Agriculture;
14
15
2. Soil productivity indices approved by the Ad Valorem
15
16
Division of the Tax Commission;
16
17
3. The specific agricultural purpose of the soil based on use
17
18
categories approved by the Ad Valorem Division of the Tax
18
19
Commission; and
19
20
4. A capitalization rate to be determined annually by the Ad
20
21
Valorem Division of the Tax Commission based on the sum of the
21
22
average first mortgage interest rate charged by the Federal Land
22
23
Bank for the immediately preceding five (5) years, weighted with the
23
24
24
Req. No. 387 Page 11

1
prevailing rate or rates for additional loans or equity, and the
1
2
effective tax rate.
2
3
The final use value will be calculated using the soil
3
4
productivity indices and the agricultural use classification as
4
5
defined by rules promulgated by the State Board of Equalization.
5
6
This subsection shall not be construed in a manner which is
6
7
inconsistent with the duties, powers, and authority of the Board as
7
8
to valuation of the counties as fixed and defined by Section 21 of
8
9
Article X of the Oklahoma Constitution.
9
10
However, in calculating the use value of buffer strips as
10
11
defined in Section 2817.2 of this title, exclusive consideration
11
12
shall be based only on income from production agriculture from such
12
13
buffer strips, not including federal or state subsidies, when valued
13
14
as required by subsection C of Section 2817.2 of this title.
14
15
D. The use value of nonresidential improvements on agricultural
15
16
land shall be based on the cost approach to value estimation using
16
17
currently updated cost manuals published by the Marshall and Swift
17
18
Company or similar cost manuals approved by the Ad Valorem Division
18
19
of the Tax Commission. The use value estimates for the
19
20
nonresidential improvements shall take obsolescence and depreciation
20
21
into consideration in addition to necessary adjustments for local
21
22
variations in the cost of labor and materials. This section shall
22
23
not be construed in a manner which is inconsistent with the duties,
23
24
powers, and authority of the Board as to equalization of valuation
24
Req. No. 387 Page 12

1
of the counties as determined and defined by Section 21 of Article X
1
2
of the Oklahoma Constitution.
2
3
The use value of facilities used for poultry production shall be
3
4
determined according to the following procedures:
4
5
1. The Ad Valorem Division of the Tax Commission is hereby
5
6
directed to develop a standard system of valuation of both real and
6
7
personal property of such facilities, which shall be used by all
7
8
county assessors in this state, under which valuation based on the
8
9
following shall be presumed to be the fair cash value of the
9
10
property:
10
11
a. for real property, a ten-year depreciation schedule,
11
12
at the end of which the residual value is twenty
12
13
percent (20%) of the value of the facility during its
13
14
first year of operation, and
14
15
b. for personal property, a five-year depreciation
15
16
schedule, at the end of which the residual value is
16
17
zero;
17
18
2. Such facilities shall be valued only in comparison to other
18
19
facilities used exclusively for poultry production. Such a facility
19
20
which is no longer used for poultry production shall be deemed to
20
21
have no productive use;
21
22
3. During the first year such a facility is placed on the tax
22
23
rolls, its fair cash value shall be presumed to be the lesser of the
23
24
24
Req. No. 387 Page 13

1
actual purchase price or the actual documented cost of construction;
1
2
and
2
3
4. For the purpose of determining the valuation of
3
4
nonresidential improvements used for poultry production, the
4
5
provisions of this subsection shall be applicable and such
5
6
improvements shall not be considered to be commercial property.
6
7
E. The value of investment in property used exclusively by an
7
8
oil refinery that is used wholly as a facility, device, or method
8
9
for the desulphurization of gasoline or diesel fuel as defined in
9
10
Section 2817.3 of this title shall not be included in the
10
11
capitalization used in the determination of fair market value of
11
12
such oil refinery if such property would qualify as exempt property
12
13
pursuant to Section 2902 of this title, whether or not an
13
14
application for such exemption is made by an otherwise qualifying
14
15
manufacturing concern owning the property described by Section
15
16
2817.3 of this title.
16
17
F. The use value of a lot in any platted addition or a
17
18
subdivision in a city, town, or county zoned for residential,
18
19
commercial, industrial, or other use shall be deemed to be the fair
19
20
cash value of the underlying tract of land platted, divided by the
20
21
number of lots contained in the platted addition or subdivision
21
22
until the lot shall have been conveyed to a bona fide purchaser or
22
23
the lot with building or buildings located thereon shall have been
23
24
occupied other than as a sales office by the owner thereof, or shall
24
Req. No. 387 Page 14

1
have been leased, whichever event shall first occur. One who
1
2
purchases a lot for the purposes of constructing and selling a
2
3
building on such lot shall not be deemed to be a bona fide purchaser
3
4
for purposes of this section. However, if the lot is held for a
4
5
period longer than two (2) years before construction, then the
5
6
assessor may consider the lot to have been conveyed to a bona fide
6
7
purchaser. The cost of any land or improvements to any real
7
8
property required to be dedicated to public use including, but not
8
9
limited to, streets, curbs, gutters, sidewalks, storm or sanitary
9
10
sewers, utilities, detention or retention ponds, easements, parks,
10
11
or reserves shall not be utilized by the county assessor in the
11
12
valuation of any real property for assessment purposes.
12
13
G. The transfer of real property without a change in its use
13
14
classification shall not require a reassessment thereof based
14
15
exclusively upon the sale value of the property. However, if the
15
16
county assessor determines:
16
17
1. That by reason of the transfer of a property there is a
17
18
change in the actual use or classification of the property; or
18
19
2. That by reason of the amount of the sales consideration it
19
20
is obvious that the use classification prior to the transfer of the
20
21
property is not commensurate with and would not justify the amount
21
22
of the sales consideration of the property;
22
23
then the assessor shall, in either event, reassess the property for
23
24
the new use classification for which the property is being used, or,
24
Req. No. 387 Page 15

1
the highest and best use classification for which the property may,
1
2
by reason of the transfer, be classified for use.
2
3
H. When the term “fair cash value” or the language “fair cash
3
4
value, estimated at the price it would bring at a fair voluntary
4
5
sale” is used in the Ad Valorem Tax Code, in connection with and in
5
6
relation to the assessment of real property, it is defined to mean
6
7
and shall be given the meaning ascribed and assigned to it in this
7
8
section and when the term or language is used in the Code in
8
9
connection with the assessment of personal property, it shall be
9
10
given its ordinary or literal meaning.
10
11
I. Where any real property is zoned for a use by a proper
11
12
zoning authority, and the use of the property has not been changed,
12
13
the use and not zoning shall determine assessment. Any reassessment
13
14
required shall be effective January 1 following the change in use.
14
15
Taxable real property need not be listed annually with the county
15
16
assessor.
16
17
J. If any real property shall become taxable after January 1 of
17
18
any year, the county assessor shall assess the same and place it
18
19
upon the tax rolls for the next ensuing year. When any building is
19
20
constructed upon land after January 1 of any year, the value of the
20
21
building shall be added by the county assessor to the assessed
21
22
valuation of the land upon which the building is constructed at the
22
23
fair cash value thereof for the next ensuing year. However, after
23
24
the building has been completed it shall be deemed to have a value
24
Req. No. 387 Page 16

1
for assessment purposes of the fair cash value of the materials used
1
2
in such building only, until the building and the land on which the
2
3
building is located shall have been conveyed to a bona fide
3
4
purchaser or shall have been occupied or used for any purpose other
4
5
than as a sales office by the owner thereof, or shall have been
5
6
leased, whichever event shall first occur. The county assessor
6
7
shall continue to assess the building based upon the fair market
7
8
value of the materials used therein until the building and land upon
8
9
which the building is located shall have been conveyed to a bona
9
10
fide purchaser or is occupied or used for any purpose other than as
10
11
a sales office by the owner thereof, or is leased, whichever event
11
12
shall first occur. In the event a building or buildings described
12
13
by this subsection are intended to serve primarily as residential
13
14
rental housing, after the building or buildings have been completed
14
15
they shall be deemed to have an initial value for assessment
15
16
purposes not to exceed the fair cash value of the land and the
16
17
actual documented cost of any improvements made to the building or
17
18
buildings. The county assessor shall continue to assess such
18
19
building or buildings at a value not to exceed the fair cash value
19
20
of the land and actual documented cost of any improvements made
20
21
until either two (2) years have passed since the date on which the
21
22
building or buildings were first reflected on the tax rolls, or the
22
23
building or buildings and the land on which the building or
23
24
24
Req. No. 387 Page 17

1
buildings are located shall have been conveyed to a bona fide
1
2
purchaser, whichever event shall first occur.
2
3
K. In the event improvements on land or personal property
3
4
located therein or thereon are destroyed or partially destroyed, or
4
5
the land itself is impaired or partially impaired by fire,
5
6
lightning, storm, winds, floodwaters, overflow of streams, or other
6
7
cause (all such destruction or impairments being referred to herein
7
8
as “damage”) during any year, the county assessor shall determine
8
9
the amount of damage and shall reassess the property for that year
9
10
at the fair cash value of the property, taking into account the
10
11
actual loss of functional use of the property occasioned by such
11
12
damage. The assessor shall make the appropriate value adjustments
12
13
to the property for that tax year up to the time at which the
13
14
assessor publishes the “Assessor’s assessor’s Report to the Excise
14
15
Board” Board as required by subsection D of Section 2867 of this
15
16
title. After such time, adjustments can be made only by the county
16
17
board of tax roll corrections and only after the assessor has
17
18
certified the tax roll for that year. The board secretary shall
18
19
notify property owners in advance of the time and place at which the
19
20
value adjustment to their property will be heard by the board. The
20
21
board of tax roll corrections is authorized only to approve or
21
22
reject the value adjustment submitted by the county assessor.
22
23
L. All taxable personal property used in the exploration of
23
24
oil, natural gas, or other minerals including drilling equipment and
24
Req. No. 387 Page 18

1
rigs, shall be assessed annually at the value set forth in the first
1
2
Hadco International monthly bulletin published for the tax year,
2
3
using the appropriate depth rating assigned to the drawworks by its
3
4
manufacturer and the actual condition of the rig.
4
5
M. The value of taxable tangible personal property used in
5
6
commercial disposal systems of waste materials from the production
6
7
of oil and gas shall not include any contract rights or leases for
7
8
the use of such systems nor any value associated with the wellbore
8
9
or non-recoverable down-hole material including casing.
