20
verification of the validity and timeliness of the tax credit
20
21
claimed upon a tax return pursuant to this subsection but shall not
21

E. Any nontaxable entities, including agencies of the State of
11
12
Oklahoma or political subdivisions thereof, shall be eligible to
12
13
establish a transferable tax credit in the amount provided in

14
subsection B of this section. Such tax credit shall be a property
14
15
right available to a state agency or political subdivision of this
15
16
state to transfer or sell to a taxable entity, whether individual or
16
17
corporate, who shall have an actual or anticipated income tax
17
18
liability under Section 2355 of this title. These tax credit
18
19
provisions are authorized as an incentive to the State of Oklahoma,
19
20
its agencies and political subdivisions to encourage the expenditure

1
2
of the credit allowed, but not used, shall be freely transferable at
2
3
any time during the ten (10) years following the year of
3
4
qualification. Any person to whom or to which a tax credit is
4
5
transferred shall have only such rights to claim and use the credit
5
6
under the terms that would have applied to the entity by whom or by
6
7
which the tax credit was transferred. The provisions of this
7
8
subsection shall not limit the ability of a tax credit transferee to
8
9
reduce the tax liability of the transferee, regardless of the actual
9
10
tax liability of the tax credit transferor, for the relevant taxable
10
11
period. The transferor initially allowed the credit and any
11
12
subsequent transferees shall jointly file a copy of any written
12
13
transfer agreement with the Oklahoma Tax Commission within thirty
13
14

14
15
name, address and taxpayer identification number or Social Security
15
16
number of the parties to the transfer, the amount of the credit
16
17
being transferred, the year the credit was originally allowed to the
17
18
transferor, and the tax year or years for which the credit may be
18
19
claimed. The Tax Commission may promulgate rules to permit
19
20
verification of the validity and timeliness of the tax credit
20
21
claimed upon a tax return pursuant to this subsection but shall not
21
22
promulgate any rules that unduly restrict or hinder the transfers of
22
23
such tax credit. The tax credit allowed by this section, upon the
23
24
election of the taxpayer, may be claimed as a payment of tax, a
24

9
10
section may be claimed for any event, transaction, investment,
10
11
expenditure or other act occurring on or after July 1, 2010, for
11
12

18
July 1, 2010, through June 30, 2011, may not be claimed for any
18
19
period prior to the taxable year beginning January 1, 2012. No
19
20
credits which accrue during the period of July 1, 2010, through June
20
21
30, 2011, may be used to file an amended tax return for any taxable

5
The Tax Commission shall annually calculate and publish a percentage
5
6
by which the credits authorized by subparagraphs b, c and d of

7
8
total amount of credits used to offset tax or paid as a refund does
8
9
not exceed Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000.00) per year.
9
10
The formula to be used for the percentage adjustment shall be Five
10
11
Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000.00) divided by the credits
11
12
claimed in the second preceding year.
12
13
J. Pursuant to subsection I of this section, in the event the

15
16
of paragraph 2 of subsection A of this section exceed Five Hundred
16
17
Thousand Dollars ($500,000.00) in any calendar year, the Tax
17
18
Commission shall permit any excess over Five Hundred Thousand
18
19
