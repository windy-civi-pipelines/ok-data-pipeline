17 SECTION 1. NEW LAW A new section of law to be codified
18 in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 307.2 of Title 25, unless there
19 is created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:
20 A. A member of a public body may participate in a public
21 meeting via videoconference or teleconference from the private
22 residence of the member, and shall not be required to disclose the
23 address of the private residence on the meeting notice or agenda,
24 provided the following conditions are met:
Req. No. 12573 Page 1

1 1. The member identifies the location as the "private
2 residence" on the meeting notice and agenda, without further detail;
3 2. The videoconference or teleconference technology used allows
4 the public to see and hear the member during the meeting; and
5 3. The member's participation from his or her private residence
6 does not restrict or limit public access to the meeting or the
7 member's contributions to the meeting.
8 B. This section does not apply when a public body holds a
9 meeting entirely or primarily at a member's private residence, or
10 when two or more members are present at a member's private
11 residence. In such cases, full disclosure of the meeting location
12 is required under the existing provisions of the Oklahoma Open
13 Meeting Act.
14 C. For purposes of this section, "private residence" means any
15 home, apartment, or other personal living space that is not used as
16 a public or commercial meeting site.
17 D. Public bodies shall ensure compliance with all other
18 provisions of the Oklahoma Open Meeting Act, including transparency,
19 accessibility, and notice requirements, when implementing this
20 section.
21 E. It is the Legislature's intent to balance the principles of
22 open governance with the privacy and security of individuals
23 participating in public meetings from private residences. This
24
Req. No. 12573 Page 2
