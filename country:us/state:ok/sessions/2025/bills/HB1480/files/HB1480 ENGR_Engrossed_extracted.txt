21 debt by the court through a hardship waiver of the court financial

1 cons equences of failing to pay the court financial obligations, and
2 that the child, the parents, guardian, custodian, or responsible
3 relative may request a cost hearing if at any time he or she is
4 unable to pay the court financial obligations, at which point the
5 court may waive all or part of the debt owed. If the total amount
6 of court financial obligations owed is not available at the time of

17 Section 567 of Title 21 of the Oklahoma Statutes, against the child,
18 the parents, guardian, custodian, or responsible relative based on

20 contemnor shall appear at the initial appearance or arraignment.

2 admitted at trial.
3 SECTION 2. AMENDATORY 10A O.S. 2021, Section 2-3-101, is
4 amended to read as follows:
5 Section 2-3-101. A. When a child is taken into custody
6 pursuant to the provisions of the Oklahoma Juvenile Code, the child
7 shall be detained only if it is necessary to assure the appearance
8 of the child in court or for the protection of the child or the
9 public.
10 1. a. No child twelve (12) years of age or younger shall be
11 placed in a juvenile detention facility unless all
12 alternatives have been exhausted and the child is
13 currently charged with a criminal offense that would
14 constitute a felony if committed by an adult and it
15 has been indicated by a risk-assessment screening that
16 the child requires detention. The detention of any
17 child twelve (12) years of age or younger shall be
18 judicially reviewed pursuant to subparagraph c of this
19 paragraph.
20 b. Any child who is thirteen (13) or fourteen (14) years
21 of age may be admitted to a juvenile detention
22 facility only after all alternatives have been

24 criminal offense that would constitute a felony if
ENGR. H. B. NO. 1480 Page 8
1 committed by an adult and it has been indicated by a
2 risk-assessment screening that the child requires
3 detention.
4 c. No preadjudicatory or predisposition detention or
5 custody order shall remain in force and effect for
6 more than thirty (30) days. The court, for good and

9 to exceed sixty (60) days. If the child is being
10 detained for the commission of a murder, the court
11 may, if it is in the best interests of justice, extend
12 the effective period of such an order an additional
13 sixty (60) days.
14 d. Whenever the court orders a child to be held in a
15 juvenile detention facility, an order for secure
16 detention shall remain in force and effect for not
17 more than fifteen (15) days after such order. Upon an
18 application of the district attorney and after a
19 hearing on such application, the court, for good and
20 sufficient cause shown, may extend the effective
21 period of such an order for an additional period not
22 to exceed fifteen (15) days after such hearing. The
23 total period of preadjudicatory or predisposition
24 shall not exceed the ninety-day limitation as
ENGR. H. B. NO. 1480 Page 9
1 specified in subparagraph a of this paragraph. The
2 child shall be present at the hearing on the
3 application for extension unless, as authorized and
4 approved by the court, the attorney for the child is
5 present at the hearing and the child is available to
6 participate in the hearing via telephone conference

10 the child, to hear and be heard by the other parties
11 at the hearing. After the hearing, the court may

21 debt by the court through a hardship waiver of the court financial

ENGR. H. B. NO. 1480 Page 4

1 cons equences of failing to pay the court financial obligations, and
2 that the child, the parents, guardian, custodian, or responsible
3 relative may request a cost hearing if at any time he or she is
4 unable to pay the court financial obligations, at which point the
5 court may waive all or part of the debt owed. If the total amount
6 of court financial obligations owed is not available at the time of
7 the plea or disposition, the court shall inform the child, the

13 responsible relative fails to appear at the scheduled cost hearing,
14 no warrant shall be issued based upon the nonappearance. However,
15 the court may notify the district attorney of the nonappearance and
16 the district attorney may pursue indirect contempt, pursuant to
17 Section 567 of Title 21 of the Oklahoma Statutes, against the child,
18 the parents, guardian, custodian, or responsible relative based on
19 the nonpayment of the court financial obligations. The alleged
20 contemnor shall appear at the initial appearance or arraignment.
21 Provided, however, that the contemnor shall be released on his or
22 her own recognizance and no cash bond shall be required. During the
23 trial on the contempt, prior determinations regarding the alleged
24 contemnor's ability to pay the court financial obligations shall be
ENGR. H. B. NO. 1480 Page 7

1 reco nsidered based on evidence of the contemnor's ability to pay
2 admitted at trial.
3 SECTION 2. AMENDATORY 10A O.S. 2021, Section 2-3-101, is
4 amended to read as follows:
5 Section 2-3-101. A. When a child is taken into custody
6 pursuant to the provisions of the Oklahoma Juvenile Code, the child
7 shall be detained only if it is necessary to assure the appearance
8 of the child in court or for the protection of the child or the
9 public.
10 1. a. No child twelve (12) years of age or younger shall be
11 placed in a juvenile detention facility unless all
12 alternatives have been exhausted and the child is
13 currently charged with a criminal offense that would
14 constitute a felony if committed by an adult and it
15 has been indicated by a risk-assessment screening that
16 the child requires detention. The detention of any
17 child twelve (12) years of age or younger shall be
18 judicially reviewed pursuant to subparagraph c of this
19 paragraph.
20 b. Any child who is thirteen (13) or fourteen (14) years
21 of age may be admitted to a juvenile detention
22 facility only after all alternatives have been

3 detention.
4 c. No preadjudicatory or predisposition detention or

14 d. Whenever the court orders a child to be held in a
15 juvenile detention facility, an order for secure
16 detention shall remain in force and effect for not
17 more than fifteen (15) days after such order. Upon an
18 application of the district attorney and after a
19 hearing on such application, the court, for good and
20 sufficient cause shown, may extend the effective
21 period of such an order for an additional period not
22 to exceed fifteen (15) days after such hearing. The
23 total period of preadjudicatory or predisposition
24 shall not exceed the ninety-day limitation as
ENGR. H. B. NO. 1480 Page 9

2 child shall be present at the hearing on the
3 application for extension unless, as authorized and
4 approved by the court, the attorney for the child is
5 present at the hearing and the child is available to
6 participate in the hearing via telephone conference
7 communication. For the purpose of this paragraph,
8 "telephone conference communication" means use of a

10 the child, to hear and be heard by the other parties
11 at the hearing. After the hearing, the court may

9 health treatment facility in accordance with the provisions of the
10 Inpatient Mental Health and Substance Abuse Treatment of Minors Act,
