FLOOR AMENDMENT No. ________
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT
(Date)
I move to amend Engrossed House Bill No. 1850 on Page 54, Line 15 ½, by inserting a new
subsection E to read as follows:
“E. If a distribution to a beneficiary is subject to the exercise of the trustee’s discretion, whether
or not the terms of a trust include a standard to guide the trustee in making distributions, then the
interest is neither a property interest nor an enforceable right, but a mere expectancy.”
