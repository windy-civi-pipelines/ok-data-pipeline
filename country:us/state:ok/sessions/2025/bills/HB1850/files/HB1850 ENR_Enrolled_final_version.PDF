A. If, upon petition, the court finds that the settlor and all
beneficiaries consent to the modification or termination of a
noncharitable irrevocable trust, the court shall approve the
modification or termination even if the modification or termination
is inconsistent with a material purpose of the trust. A settlor's
power to consent to a trust's modification or termination may be

result in distribution of the trust property to a noncharitable
beneficiary prevails over the power of the court under subsection A
of this section to apply cy pres to modify or terminate the trust
only if, when the provision takes effect, the trust property is to
revert to the settlor and the settlor is still living.

affected by the transaction unless:

amended.
E. If a distribution to a beneficiary is subject to the
exercise of the trustee’s discretion, whether or not the terms of a
trust include a standard to guide the trustee in making

ENR. H. B. NO. 1850 Page 46

or more of the trustee's descendants, siblings, or parents, or the

under this section without knowledge that the representations
contained therein are incorrect is not liable to any person for so
acting and may assume without inquiry the existence of the facts
