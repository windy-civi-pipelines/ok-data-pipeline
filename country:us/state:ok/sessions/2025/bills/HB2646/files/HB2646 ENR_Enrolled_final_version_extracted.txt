Section 4:
Section 2358v3. For all tax years beginning after December 31,
1981, taxable income and adjusted gross income shall be adjusted to
arrive at Oklahoma taxable income and Oklahoma adjusted gross income
as required by this section.
A. The taxable income of any taxpayer shall be adjusted to
arrive at Oklahoma taxable income for corporations and Oklahoma
adjusted gross income for individuals, as follows:

Section 5:
1. There shall be added interest income on obligations of any
state or political subdivision thereto which is not otherwise
exempted pursuant to other laws of this state, to the extent that
such interest is not included in taxable income and adjusted gross
income.

Section 6:
2. There shall be deducted amounts included in such income that
the state is prohibited from taxing because of the provisions of the
Federal United States Constitution, the State Oklahoma Constitution,
federal laws or laws of Oklahoma.

Section 7:
3. The amount of any federal net operating loss deduction shall
be adjusted as follows:
a. For carryovers and carrybacks to taxable years
beginning before January 1, 1981, the amount of any
net operating loss deduction allowed to a taxpayer for
federal income tax purposes shall be reduced to an
amount which is the same portion thereof as the loss
from sources within this state, as determined pursuant
to this section and Section 2362 of this title, for
the taxable year in which such loss is sustained is of
the total loss for such year;
b. For carryovers and carrybacks to taxable years
beginning after December 31, 1980, the amount of any
net operating loss deduction allowed for the taxable
year shall be an amount equal to the aggregate of the
Oklahoma net operating loss carryovers and carrybacks
to such year. Oklahoma net operating losses shall be
separately determined by reference to Section 172 of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, 26
U.S.C., Section 172, as modified by the Oklahoma
Income Tax Act, Section 2351 et seq. of this title,
and shall be allowed without regard to the existence
of a federal net operating loss. For tax years
beginning after December 31, 2000, and ending before
January 1, 2008, the years to which such losses may be
carried shall be determined solely by reference to

Section 8:
Section 172 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended, 26 U.S.C., Section 172, with the exception
that the terms "net operating loss" and "taxable
income" shall be replaced with "Oklahoma net operating
loss" and "Oklahoma taxable income". For tax years
beginning after December 31, 2007, and ending before
January 1, 2009, years to which such losses may be
carried back shall be limited to two (2) years. For
tax years beginning after December 31, 2008, the years
ENR. H. B. NO. 2646 Page 2
to which such losses may be carried back shall be
determined solely by reference to Section 172 of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, 26 U.S.C.,

Section 9:
Section 172, with the exception that the terms "net
operating loss" and "taxable income" shall be replaced
with "Oklahoma net operating loss" and "Oklahoma
taxable income".

Section 10:
4. Items of the following nature shall be allocated as
indicated. Allowable deductions attributable to items separately
allocable in subparagraphs a, b and c of this paragraph, whether or
not such items of income were actually received, shall be allocated
on the same basis as those items:
a. Income from real and tangible personal property, such
as rents, oil and mining production or royalties, and
gains or losses from sales of such property, shall be
allocated in accordance with the situs of such
property;
b. Income from intangible personal property, such as
interest, dividends, patent or copyright royalties,
and gains or losses from sales of such property, shall
be allocated in accordance with the domiciliary situs
of the taxpayer, except that:
(1) where such property has acquired a nonunitary
business or commercial situs apart from the
domicile of the taxpayer such income shall be
allocated in accordance with such business or
commercial situs; interest income from
investments held to generate working capital for
a unitary business enterprise shall be included
in apportionable income; a resident trust or
resident estate shall be treated as having a
separate commercial or business situs insofar as
undistributed income is concerned, but shall not
be treated as having a separate commercial or
business situs insofar as distributed income is
concerned,
(2) for taxable years beginning after December 31,
2003, capital or ordinary gains or losses from
the sale of an ownership interest in a publicly
traded partnership, as defined by Section 7704(b)
ENR. H. B. NO. 2646 Page 3
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,
shall be allocated to this state in the ratio of
the original cost of such partnership's tangible
property in this state to the original cost of
such partnership's tangible property everywhere,
as determined at the time of the sale; if more
than fifty percent (50%) of the value of the
partnership's assets consists of intangible
assets, capital or ordinary gains or losses from
the sale of an ownership interest in the
partnership shall be allocated to this state in
accordance with the sales factor of the
partnership for its first full tax period
immediately preceding its tax period during which
the ownership interest in the partnership was
sold; the provisions of this division shall only
apply if the capital or ordinary gains or losses
from the sale of an ownership interest in a
partnership do not constitute qualifying gain
receiving capital treatment as defined in
subparagraph a of paragraph 2 of subsection F of
this section,
(3) income from such property which is required to be
allocated pursuant to the provisions of paragraph
5 of this subsection shall be allocated as herein
provided;
c. Net income or loss from a business activity which is
not a part of business carried on within or without
the state of a unitary character shall be separately
allocated to the state in which such activity is
conducted;
d. In the case of a manufacturing or processing
enterprise the business of which in Oklahoma this
state consists solely of marketing its products by:
(1) sales having a situs without this state, shipped
directly to a point from without the state to a
purchaser within the state, commonly known as
interstate sales,
(2) sales of the product stored in public warehouses
within the state pursuant to "in transit"
ENR. H. B. NO. 2646 Page 4
tariffs, as prescribed and allowed by the
Interstate Commerce Commission, to a purchaser
within the state,
(3) sales of the product stored in public warehouses
within the state where the shipment to such
warehouses is not covered by "in transit"
tariffs, as prescribed and allowed by the
Interstate Commerce Commission, to a purchaser
within or without the state,
the Oklahoma net income shall, at the option of the
taxpayer, be that portion of the total net income of
the taxpayer for federal income tax purposes derived
from the manufacture and/or processing and sales
everywhere as determined by the ratio of the sales
defined in this section made to the purchaser within
the state to the total sales everywhere. The term
"public warehouse" as used in this subparagraph means
a licensed public warehouse, the principal business of
which is warehousing merchandise for the public;
e. In the case of insurance companies, Oklahoma taxable
income shall be taxable income of the taxpayer for
federal tax purposes, as adjusted for the adjustments
provided pursuant to the provisions of paragraphs 1
and 2 of this subsection, apportioned as follows:
(1) except as otherwise provided by division (2) of
this subparagraph, taxable income of an insurance
company for a taxable year shall be apportioned
to this state by multiplying such income by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the direct
premiums written for insurance on property or
risks in this state, and the denominator of which
is the direct premiums written for insurance on
property or risks everywhere. For purposes of
this subsection, the term "direct premiums
written" means the total amount of direct
premiums written, assessments and annuity
considerations as reported for the taxable year
on the annual statement filed by the company with
the Insurance Commissioner in the form approved
by the National Association of Insurance
ENR. H. B. NO. 2646 Page 5
Commissioners, or such other form as may be
prescribed in lieu thereof,
(2) if the principal source of premiums written by an
insurance company consists of premiums for
reinsurance accepted by it, the taxable income of
such company shall be apportioned to this state
by multiplying such income by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the sum of (a) direct
premiums written for insurance on property or
risks in this state, plus (b) premiums written
for reinsurance accepted in respect of property
or risks in this state, and the denominator of
which is the sum of (c) direct premiums written
for insurance on property or risks everywhere,
plus (d) premiums written for reinsurance
accepted in respect of property or risks
everywhere. For purposes of this paragraph,
premiums written for reinsurance accepted in
respect of property or risks in this state,
whether or not otherwise determinable, may at the
election of the company be determined on the
basis of the proportion which premiums written
for insurance accepted from companies
commercially domiciled in Oklahoma this state
bears to premiums written for reinsurance
accepted from all sources, or alternatively in
the proportion which the sum of the direct
premiums written for insurance on property or
risks in this state by each ceding company from
which reinsurance is accepted bears to the sum of
the total direct premiums written by each such
ceding company for the taxable year.

Section 11:
5. The net income or loss remaining after the separate
allocation in paragraph 4 of this subsection, being that which is
derived from a unitary business enterprise, shall be apportioned to
this state on the basis of the arithmetical average of three factors
consisting of property, payroll and sales or gross revenue
enumerated as subparagraphs a, b and c of this paragraph. Net
income or loss as used in this paragraph includes that derived from
patent or copyright royalties, purchase discounts, and interest on
accounts receivable relating to or arising from a business activity,
the income from which is apportioned pursuant to this subsection,
including the sale or other disposition of such property and any
ENR. H. B. NO. 2646 Page 6
other property used in the unitary enterprise. Deductions used in
computing such net income or loss shall not include taxes based on
or measured by income. Provided, for corporations whose property
for purposes of the tax imposed by Section 2355 of this title has an
initial investment cost equaling or exceeding Two Hundred Million
Dollars ($200,000,000.00) and such investment is made on or after
July 1, 1997, or for corporations which expand their property or
facilities in this state and such expansion has an investment cost
equaling or exceeding Two Hundred Million Dollars ($200,000,000.00)
over a period not to exceed three (3) years, and such expansion is
commenced on or after January 1, 2000, the three factors shall be
apportioned with property and payroll, each comprising twenty-five
percent (25%) of the apportionment factor and sales comprising fifty
percent (50%) of the apportionment factor. The apportionment
factors shall be computed as follows:
a. The property factor is a fraction, the numerator of
which is the average value of the taxpayer's real and
tangible personal property owned or rented and used in
this state during the tax period and the denominator
of which is the average value of all the taxpayer's
real and tangible personal property everywhere owned
or rented and used during the tax period.
(1) Property, the income from which is separately
allocated in paragraph 4 of this subsection,
shall not be included in determining this
fraction. The numerator of the fraction shall
include a portion of the investment in
transportation and other equipment having no
fixed situs, such as rolling stock, buses, trucks
and trailers, including machinery and equipment
carried thereon, airplanes, salespersons'
automobiles and other similar equipment, in the
proportion that miles traveled in Oklahoma this
state by such equipment bears to total miles
traveled,
(2) Property owned by the taxpayer is valued at its
original cost. Property rented by the taxpayer
is valued at eight times the net annual rental
rate. Net annual rental rate is the annual
rental rate paid by the taxpayer, less any annual
rental rate received by the taxpayer from
subrentals,
ENR. H. B. NO. 2646 Page 7
(3) The average value of property shall be determined
by averaging the values at the beginning and
ending of the tax period but the Oklahoma Tax
Commission may require the averaging of monthly
values during the tax period if reasonably
required to reflect properly the average value of
the taxpayer's property;
b. The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of
which is the total compensation for services rendered
in the state during the tax period, and the
denominator of which is the total compensation for
services rendered everywhere during the tax period.
"Compensation", as used in this subsection, means
those paid-for services to the extent related to the
unitary business but does not include officers'
salaries, wages and other compensation.
(1) In the case of a transportation enterprise, the
numerator of the fraction shall include a portion
of such expenditure in connection with employees
operating equipment over a fixed route, such as
railroad employees, airline pilots, or bus
drivers, in this state only a part of the time,
in the proportion that mileage traveled in
Oklahoma this state bears to total mileage
traveled by such employees,
(2) In any case the numerator of the fraction shall
include a portion of such expenditures in
connection with itinerant employees, such as
traveling salespersons, in this state only a part
of the time, in the proportion that time spent in
Oklahoma this state bears to total time spent in
furtherance of the enterprise by such employees;
c. The sales factor is a fraction, the numerator of which
is the total sales or gross revenue of the taxpayer in
this state during the tax period, and the denominator
of which is the total sales or gross revenue of the
taxpayer everywhere during the tax period. "Sales",
as used in this subsection, does not include sales or
gross revenue which are separately allocated in
paragraph 4 of this subsection.
ENR. H. B. NO. 2646 Page 8
(1) Sales of tangible personal property have a situs
in this state if the property is delivered or
shipped to a purchaser other than the United
States government, within this state regardless
of the FOB Freight on Board (FOB) point or other
conditions of the sale; or the property is
shipped from an office, store, warehouse, factory
or other place of storage in this state and (a)
the purchaser is the United States government or
(b) the taxpayer is not doing business in the
state of the destination of the shipment.
(2) In the case of a railroad or interurban railway
enterprise, the numerator of the fraction shall
not be less than the allocation of revenues to
this state as shown in its annual report to the
Corporation Commission.
(3) In the case of an airline, truck or bus
enterprise or freight car, tank car, refrigerator
car or other railroad equipment enterprise, the
numerator of the fraction shall include a portion
of revenue from interstate transportation in the
proportion that interstate mileage traveled in
Oklahoma this state bears to total interstate
mileage traveled.
(4) In the case of an oil, gasoline or gas pipeline
enterprise, the numerator of the fraction shall
be either the total of traffic units of the
enterprise within Oklahoma this state or the
revenue allocated to Oklahoma this state based
upon miles moved, at the option of the taxpayer,
and the denominator of which shall be the total
of traffic units of the enterprise or the revenue
of the enterprise everywhere as appropriate to
the numerator. A "traffic unit" is hereby
defined as the transportation for a distance of
one (1) mile of one (1) barrel of oil, one (1)
gallon of gasoline or one thousand (1,000) cubic
feet of natural or casinghead gas, as the case
may be.
ENR. H. B. NO. 2646 Page 9
(5) In the case of a telephone or telegraph or other
communication enterprise, the numerator of the
fraction shall include that portion of the
interstate revenue as is allocated pursuant to
the accounting procedures prescribed by the
Federal Communications Commission; provided that
in respect to each corporation or business entity
required by the Federal Communications Commission
to keep its books and records in accordance with
a uniform system of accounts prescribed by such
Commission, the intrastate net income shall be
determined separately in the manner provided by
such uniform system of accounts and only the
interstate income shall be subject to allocation
pursuant to the provisions of this subsection.
Provided further, that the gross revenue factors
shall be those as are determined pursuant to the
accounting procedures prescribed by the Federal
Communications Commission.
In any case where the apportionment of the three factors
prescribed in this paragraph attributes to Oklahoma this state a
portion of net income of the enterprise out of all appropriate
proportion to the property owned and/or business transacted within
this state, because of the fact that one or more of the factors so
prescribed are not employed to any appreciable extent in furtherance
of the enterprise; or because one or more factors not so prescribed
are employed to a considerable extent in furtherance of the
enterprise; or because of other reasons, the Tax Commission is
empowered to permit, after a showing by taxpayer that an excessive
portion of net income has been attributed to Oklahoma this state, or
require, when in its judgment an insufficient portion of net income
has been attributed to Oklahoma this state, the elimination,
substitution, or use of additional factors, or reduction or increase
in the weight of such prescribed factors. Provided, however, that
any such variance from such prescribed factors which has the effect
of increasing the portion of net income attributable to Oklahoma
this state must not be inherently arbitrary, and application of the
recomputed final apportionment to the net income of the enterprise
must attribute to Oklahoma this state only a reasonable portion
thereof.

Section 12:
6. For calendar years 1997 and 1998, the owner of a new or
expanded agricultural commodity processing facility in this state
may exclude from Oklahoma taxable income, or in the case of an
ENR. H. B. NO. 2646 Page 10
individual, the Oklahoma adjusted gross income, fifteen percent
(15%) of the investment by the owner in the new or expanded
agricultural commodity processing facility. For calendar year 1999,
and all subsequent years, the percentage, not to exceed fifteen
percent (15%), available to the owner of a new or expanded
agricultural commodity processing facility in this state claiming
the exemption shall be adjusted annually so that the total estimated
reduction in tax liability does not exceed One Million Dollars
($1,000,000.00) annually. The Tax Commission shall promulgate rules
for determining the percentage of the investment which each eligible
taxpayer may exclude. The exclusion provided by this paragraph
shall be taken in the taxable year when the investment is made. In
the event the total reduction in tax liability authorized by this
paragraph exceeds One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) in any
calendar year, the Tax Commission shall permit any excess over One
Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) and shall factor such excess into
the percentage for subsequent years. Any amount of the exemption
permitted to be excluded pursuant to the provisions of this
paragraph but not used in any year may be carried forward as an
exemption from income pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph
for a period not exceeding six (6) years following the year in which
the investment was originally made.
For purposes of this paragraph:
a. "Agricultural commodity processing facility" means
building buildings, structures, fixtures and
improvements used or operated primarily for the
processing or production of marketable products from
agricultural commodities. The term shall also mean a
dairy operation that requires a depreciable investment
of at least Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars
($250,000.00) and which produces milk from dairy cows.
The term does not include a facility that provides
only, and nothing more than, storage, cleaning, drying
or transportation of agricultural commodities, and
b. "Facility" means each part of the facility which is
used in a process primarily for:
(1) the processing of agricultural commodities,
including receiving or storing agricultural
commodities, or the production of milk at a dairy
operation,
ENR. H. B. NO. 2646 Page 11
(2) transporting the agricultural commodities or
product before, during or after the processing,
or
(3) packaging or otherwise preparing the product for
sale or shipment.

Section 13:
7. Despite any provision to the contrary in paragraph 3 of this
subsection, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1999, in
the case of a taxpayer which has a farming loss, such farming loss
shall be considered a net operating loss carryback in accordance
with and to the extent of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended, 26 U.S.C., Section 172(b)(G) 172(b)(1)(B). However, the
amount of the net operating loss carryback shall not exceed the
lesser of:
a. Sixty Thousand Dollars ($60,000.00), or
b. the loss properly shown on Schedule F of the Internal
Revenue Service Form 1040 reduced by one-half (1/2) of
the income from all other sources other than reflected
on Schedule F.

Section 14:
8. In taxable years beginning after December 31, 1995, all
qualified wages equal to the federal income tax credit set forth in
26 U.S.C.A., Section 45A, shall be deducted from taxable income.
The deduction allowed pursuant to this paragraph shall only be
permitted for the tax years in which the federal tax credit pursuant
to 26 U.S.C.A., Section 45A, is allowed. For purposes of this
paragraph, "qualified wages" means those wages used to calculate the
federal credit pursuant to 26 U.S.C.A., Section 45A.

Section 15:
9. In taxable years beginning after December 31, 2005, an
employer that is eligible for and utilizes the Safety Pays OSHA
Consultation Service provided by the Oklahoma Department of Labor
shall receive an exemption from taxable income in the amount of One
Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00) for the tax year that the service is
utilized.

Section 16:
10. For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2010,
there shall be added to Oklahoma taxable income an amount equal to
the amount of deferred income not included in such taxable income
pursuant to Section 108(i)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986
as amended by Section 1231 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment
Act of 2009 (P.L. No. 111-5). There shall be subtracted from
ENR. H. B. NO. 2646 Page 12
Oklahoma taxable income an amount equal to the amount of deferred
income included in such taxable income pursuant to Section 108(i)(1)
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as amended by Section 1231 of
the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (P.L. No. 111-5).

Section 17:
11. For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2019,
there shall be subtracted from Oklahoma taxable income or adjusted
gross income any item of income or gain, and there shall be added to
Oklahoma taxable income or adjusted gross income any item of loss or
deduction that in the absence of an election pursuant to the
provisions of the Pass-Through Entity Tax Equity Act of 2019 would
be allocated to a member or to an indirect member of an electing
pass-through entity pursuant to Section 2351 et seq. of this title,
if (i) the electing pass-through entity has accounted for such item
in computing its Oklahoma net entity income or loss pursuant to the
provisions of the Pass-Through Entity Tax Equity Act of 2019, and
(ii) the total amount of tax attributable to any resulting Oklahoma
net entity income has been paid. The Oklahoma Tax Commission shall
promulgate rules for the reporting of such exclusion to direct and
indirect members of the electing pass-through entity. As used in
this paragraph, "electing pass-through entity", "indirect member",
and "member" shall be defined in the same manner as prescribed by

Section 18:
Section 2355.1P-2 of this title. Notwithstanding the application of
this paragraph, the adjusted tax basis of any ownership interest in
a pass-through entity for purposes of Section 2351 et seq. of this
title shall be equal to its adjusted tax basis for federal income
tax purposes.
B. 1. The taxable income of any corporation shall be further
adjusted to arrive at Oklahoma taxable income, except those
corporations electing treatment as provided in subchapter S of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, 26 U.S.C., Section 1361
et seq., and Section 2365 of this title, deductions pursuant to the
provisions of the Accelerated Cost Recovery System as defined
provided and allowed in the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981,
Public Law 97-34, 26 U.S.C., Section 168, for depreciation of assets
placed into service after December 31, 1981, shall not be allowed in
calculating Oklahoma taxable income. Such corporations shall be
allowed a deduction for depreciation of assets placed into service
after December 31, 1981, in accordance with provisions of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, 26 U.S.C., Section 1 et
seq., in effect immediately prior to the enactment of the
Accelerated Cost Recovery System. The Oklahoma tax basis for all
such assets placed into service after December 31, 1981, calculated
ENR. H. B. NO. 2646 Page 13
in this section shall be retained and utilized for all Oklahoma
income tax purposes through the final disposition of such assets.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Oklahoma Income Tax
Act, Section 2351 et seq. of this title, or of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended, to the contrary, this subsection shall
control calculation of depreciation of assets placed into service
after December 31, 1981, and before January 1, 1983.
For assets placed in service and held by a corporation in which
accelerated cost recovery system the Accelerated Cost Recovery
System was previously disallowed, an adjustment to taxable income is
required in the first taxable year beginning after December 31,
1982, to reconcile the basis of such assets to the basis allowed in
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The purpose of this
adjustment is to equalize the basis and allowance for depreciation
accounts between that reported to the Internal Revenue Service and
that reported to Oklahoma this state.

Section 19:
2. For tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2009, and
ending on or before December 31, 2009, there shall be added to
Oklahoma taxable income any amount in excess of One Hundred Seventy-

small business expense under Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended, Section 179 as provided in the American Recovery and
Reinvestment Act of 2009.
C. 1. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1987, the
taxable income of any corporation shall be further adjusted to
arrive at Oklahoma taxable income for transfers of technology to
qualified small businesses located in Oklahoma this state. Such
transferor corporation shall be allowed an exemption from taxable
income of an amount equal to the amount of royalty payment received
as a result of such transfer; provided, however, such amount shall
not exceed ten percent (10%) of the amount of gross proceeds
received by such transferor corporation as a result of the
technology transfer. Such exemption shall be allowed for a period
not to exceed ten (10) years from the date of receipt of the first
royalty payment accruing from such transfer. No exemption may be
claimed for transfers of technology to qualified small businesses
made prior to January 1, 1988.

employees and assets located in Oklahoma this
state at the time of the transfer, and
(3) Not a subsidiary or affiliate of the transferor

adjusted for qualifying gains receiving capital treatment. Such
corporations, estates or trusts shall be allowed a deduction from
Oklahoma taxable income for the amount of qualifying gains receiving
capital treatment earned by the corporation, estate or trust during
the taxable year and included in the federal taxable income of such
corporation, estate or trust.

Section 21:
2. As used in this subsection:
a. "qualifying gains receiving capital treatment" means
the amount of net capital gains, as defined in Section

of at least five (5) years prior to the date of
the transaction from which such net capital gains
arise,

An Act relating to revenue and taxation; amending 68
O.S. 2021, Section 2358, as last amended by Section
155, Chapter 452, O.S.L. 2024 (68 O.S. Supp. 2024,
Section 2358), which relates to adjustments;
eliminating limitation on itemization of wagering
losses for certain tax years; updating statutory

providing an effective date.
SUBJECT: Revenue and taxation
BE IT ENACTED BY THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF OKLAHOMA:
SECTION 1. AMENDATORY 68 O.S. 2021, Section 2358v3, as
last amended by Section 155, Chapter 452, O.S.L. 2024 (68 O.S. Supp.
2024, Section 2358v3), is amended to read as follows:
Section 2358v3. For all tax years beginning after December 31,
1981, taxable income and adjusted gross income shall be adjusted to
arrive at Oklahoma taxable income and Oklahoma adjusted gross income
as required by this section.
A. The taxable income of any taxpayer shall be adjusted to
arrive at Oklahoma taxable income for corporations and Oklahoma
adjusted gross income for individuals, as follows:
1. There shall be added interest income on obligations of any
state or political subdivision thereto which is not otherwise
exempted pursuant to other laws of this state, to the extent that

such interest is not included in taxable income and adjusted gross
income.
2. There shall be deducted amounts included in such income that
the state is prohibited from taxing because of the provisions of the
Federal United States Constitution, the State Oklahoma Constitution,
federal laws or laws of Oklahoma.
3. The amount of any federal net operating loss deduction shall
be adjusted as follows:
a. For carryovers and carrybacks to taxable years
beginning before January 1, 1981, the amount of any
net operating loss deduction allowed to a taxpayer for
federal income tax purposes shall be reduced to an
amount which is the same portion thereof as the loss
from sources within this state, as determined pursuant
to this section and Section 2362 of this title, for
the taxable year in which such loss is sustained is of
the total loss for such year;
b. For carryovers and carrybacks to taxable years
beginning after December 31, 1980, the amount of any
net operating loss deduction allowed for the taxable
year shall be an amount equal to the aggregate of the
Oklahoma net operating loss carryovers and carrybacks
to such year. Oklahoma net operating losses shall be
separately determined by reference to Section 172 of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, 26
U.S.C., Section 172, as modified by the Oklahoma
Income Tax Act, Section 2351 et seq. of this title,
and shall be allowed without regard to the existence
of a federal net operating loss. For tax years
beginning after December 31, 2000, and ending before
January 1, 2008, the years to which such losses may be
carried shall be determined solely by reference to
Section 172 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended, 26 U.S.C., Section 172, with the exception
that the terms "net operating loss" and "taxable
income" shall be replaced with "Oklahoma net operating
loss" and "Oklahoma taxable income". For tax years
beginning after December 31, 2007, and ending before
January 1, 2009, years to which such losses may be
carried back shall be limited to two (2) years. For
tax years beginning after December 31, 2008, the years
ENR. H. B. NO. 2646 Page 2

to which such losses may be carried back shall be
determined solely by reference to Section 172 of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, 26 U.S.C.,
Section 172, with the exception that the terms "net
operating loss" and "taxable income" shall be replaced
with "Oklahoma net operating loss" and "Oklahoma
taxable income".
4. Items of the following nature shall be allocated as
indicated. Allowable deductions attributable to items separately
allocable in subparagraphs a, b and c of this paragraph, whether or
not such items of income were actually received, shall be allocated
on the same basis as those items:
a. Income from real and tangible personal property, such
as rents, oil and mining production or royalties, and
gains or losses from sales of such property, shall be
allocated in accordance with the situs of such
property;
b. Income from intangible personal property, such as
interest, dividends, patent or copyright royalties,
and gains or losses from sales of such property, shall
be allocated in accordance with the domiciliary situs
of the taxpayer, except that:
(1) where such property has acquired a nonunitary
business or commercial situs apart from the
domicile of the taxpayer such income shall be
allocated in accordance with such business or
commercial situs; interest income from
investments held to generate working capital for
a unitary business enterprise shall be included
in apportionable income; a resident trust or
resident estate shall be treated as having a
separate commercial or business situs insofar as
undistributed income is concerned, but shall not
be treated as having a separate commercial or
business situs insofar as distributed income is
concerned,
(2) for taxable years beginning after December 31,
2003, capital or ordinary gains or losses from
the sale of an ownership interest in a publicly
traded partnership, as defined by Section 7704(b)
ENR. H. B. NO. 2646 Page 3

of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,
shall be allocated to this state in the ratio of
the original cost of such partnership's tangible
property in this state to the original cost of
such partnership's tangible property everywhere,
as determined at the time of the sale; if more
than fifty percent (50%) of the value of the
partnership's assets consists of intangible
assets, capital or ordinary gains or losses from
the sale of an ownership interest in the
partnership shall be allocated to this state in
accordance with the sales factor of the
partnership for its first full tax period
immediately preceding its tax period during which
the ownership interest in the partnership was
sold; the provisions of this division shall only
apply if the capital or ordinary gains or losses
from the sale of an ownership interest in a
partnership do not constitute qualifying gain
receiving capital treatment as defined in
subparagraph a of paragraph 2 of subsection F of
this section,
(3) income from such property which is required to be
allocated pursuant to the provisions of paragraph
5 of this subsection shall be allocated as herein
provided;
c. Net income or loss from a business activity which is
not a part of business carried on within or without
the state of a unitary character shall be separately
allocated to the state in which such activity is
conducted;
d. In the case of a manufacturing or processing
enterprise the business of which in Oklahoma this
state consists solely of marketing its products by:
(1) sales having a situs without this state, shipped
directly to a point from without the state to a
purchaser within the state, commonly known as
interstate sales,
(2) sales of the product stored in public warehouses
within the state pursuant to "in transit"
ENR. H. B. NO. 2646 Page 4

tariffs, as prescribed and allowed by the
Interstate Commerce Commission, to a purchaser
within the state,
(3) sales of the product stored in public warehouses
within the state where the shipment to such
warehouses is not covered by "in transit"
tariffs, as prescribed and allowed by the
Interstate Commerce Commission, to a purchaser
within or without the state,
the Oklahoma net income shall, at the option of the
taxpayer, be that portion of the total net income of
the taxpayer for federal income tax purposes derived
from the manufacture and/or processing and sales
everywhere as determined by the ratio of the sales
defined in this section made to the purchaser within
the state to the total sales everywhere. The term
"public warehouse" as used in this subparagraph means
a licensed public warehouse, the principal business of
which is warehousing merchandise for the public;
e. In the case of insurance companies, Oklahoma taxable
income shall be taxable income of the taxpayer for
federal tax purposes, as adjusted for the adjustments
provided pursuant to the provisions of paragraphs 1
and 2 of this subsection, apportioned as follows:
(1) except as otherwise provided by division (2) of
this subparagraph, taxable income of an insurance
company for a taxable year shall be apportioned
to this state by multiplying such income by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the direct
premiums written for insurance on property or
risks in this state, and the denominator of which
is the direct premiums written for insurance on
property or risks everywhere. For purposes of
this subsection, the term "direct premiums
written" means the total amount of direct
premiums written, assessments and annuity
considerations as reported for the taxable year
on the annual statement filed by the company with
the Insurance Commissioner in the form approved
by the National Association of Insurance
ENR. H. B. NO. 2646 Page 5

Commissioners, or such other form as may be
prescribed in lieu thereof,
(2) if the principal source of premiums written by an
insurance company consists of premiums for
reinsurance accepted by it, the taxable income of
such company shall be apportioned to this state
by multiplying such income by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the sum of (a) direct
premiums written for insurance on property or
risks in this state, plus (b) premiums written
for reinsurance accepted in respect of property
or risks in this state, and the denominator of
which is the sum of (c) direct premiums written
for insurance on property or risks everywhere,
plus (d) premiums written for reinsurance
accepted in respect of property or risks
everywhere. For purposes of this paragraph,
premiums written for reinsurance accepted in
respect of property or risks in this state,
whether or not otherwise determinable, may at the
election of the company be determined on the
basis of the proportion which premiums written
for insurance accepted from companies
commercially domiciled in Oklahoma this state
bears to premiums written for reinsurance
accepted from all sources, or alternatively in
the proportion which the sum of the direct
premiums written for insurance on property or
risks in this state by each ceding company from
which reinsurance is accepted bears to the sum of
the total direct premiums written by each such
ceding company for the taxable year.
5. The net income or loss remaining after the separate
allocation in paragraph 4 of this subsection, being that which is
derived from a unitary business enterprise, shall be apportioned to
this state on the basis of the arithmetical average of three factors
consisting of property, payroll and sales or gross revenue
enumerated as subparagraphs a, b and c of this paragraph. Net
income or loss as used in this paragraph includes that derived from
patent or copyright royalties, purchase discounts, and interest on
accounts receivable relating to or arising from a business activity,
the income from which is apportioned pursuant to this subsection,
including the sale or other disposition of such property and any
ENR. H. B. NO. 2646 Page 6

other property used in the unitary enterprise. Deductions used in
computing such net income or loss shall not include taxes based on
or measured by income. Provided, for corporations whose property
for purposes of the tax imposed by Section 2355 of this title has an
initial investment cost equaling or exceeding Two Hundred Million
Dollars ($200,000,000.00) and such investment is made on or after
July 1, 1997, or for corporations which expand their property or
facilities in this state and such expansion has an investment cost
equaling or exceeding Two Hundred Million Dollars ($200,000,000.00)
over a period not to exceed three (3) years, and such expansion is
commenced on or after January 1, 2000, the three factors shall be
apportioned with property and payroll, each comprising twenty-five
percent (25%) of the apportionment factor and sales comprising fifty
percent (50%) of the apportionment factor. The apportionment
factors shall be computed as follows:
a. The property factor is a fraction, the numerator of
which is the average value of the taxpayer's real and
tangible personal property owned or rented and used in
this state during the tax period and the denominator
of which is the average value of all the taxpayer's
real and tangible personal property everywhere owned
or rented and used during the tax period.
(1) Property, the income from which is separately
allocated in paragraph 4 of this subsection,
shall not be included in determining this
fraction. The numerator of the fraction shall
include a portion of the investment in
transportation and other equipment having no
fixed situs, such as rolling stock, buses, trucks
and trailers, including machinery and equipment
carried thereon, airplanes, salespersons'
automobiles and other similar equipment, in the
proportion that miles traveled in Oklahoma this
state by such equipment bears to total miles
traveled,
(2) Property owned by the taxpayer is valued at its
original cost. Property rented by the taxpayer
is valued at eight times the net annual rental
rate. Net annual rental rate is the annual
rental rate paid by the taxpayer, less any annual
rental rate received by the taxpayer from
subrentals,
ENR. H. B. NO. 2646 Page 7

(3) The average value of property shall be determined
by averaging the values at the beginning and
ending of the tax period but the Oklahoma Tax
Commission may require the averaging of monthly
values during the tax period if reasonably
required to reflect properly the average value of
the taxpayer's property;
b. The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of
which is the total compensation for services rendered
in the state during the tax period, and the
denominator of which is the total compensation for
services rendered everywhere during the tax period.
"Compensation", as used in this subsection, means
those paid-for services to the extent related to the
unitary business but does not include officers'
salaries, wages and other compensation.
(1) In the case of a transportation enterprise, the
numerator of the fraction shall include a portion
of such expenditure in connection with employees
operating equipment over a fixed route, such as
railroad employees, airline pilots, or bus
drivers, in this state only a part of the time,
in the proportion that mileage traveled in
Oklahoma this state bears to total mileage
traveled by such employees,
(2) In any case the numerator of the fraction shall
include a portion of such expenditures in
connection with itinerant employees, such as
traveling salespersons, in this state only a part
of the time, in the proportion that time spent in
Oklahoma this state bears to total time spent in
furtherance of the enterprise by such employees;
c. The sales factor is a fraction, the numerator of which
is the total sales or gross revenue of the taxpayer in
this state during the tax period, and the denominator
of which is the total sales or gross revenue of the
taxpayer everywhere during the tax period. "Sales",
as used in this subsection, does not include sales or
gross revenue which are separately allocated in
paragraph 4 of this subsection.
ENR. H. B. NO. 2646 Page 8

(1) Sales of tangible personal property have a situs
in this state if the property is delivered or
shipped to a purchaser other than the United
States government, within this state regardless
of the FOB Freight on Board (FOB) point or other
conditions of the sale; or the property is
shipped from an office, store, warehouse, factory
or other place of storage in this state and (a)
the purchaser is the United States government or
(b) the taxpayer is not doing business in the
state of the destination of the shipment.
(2) In the case of a railroad or interurban railway
enterprise, the numerator of the fraction shall
not be less than the allocation of revenues to
this state as shown in its annual report to the
Corporation Commission.
(3) In the case of an airline, truck or bus
enterprise or freight car, tank car, refrigerator
car or other railroad equipment enterprise, the
numerator of the fraction shall include a portion
of revenue from interstate transportation in the
proportion that interstate mileage traveled in
Oklahoma this state bears to total interstate
mileage traveled.
(4) In the case of an oil, gasoline or gas pipeline
enterprise, the numerator of the fraction shall
be either the total of traffic units of the
enterprise within Oklahoma this state or the
revenue allocated to Oklahoma this state based
upon miles moved, at the option of the taxpayer,
and the denominator of which shall be the total
of traffic units of the enterprise or the revenue
of the enterprise everywhere as appropriate to
the numerator. A "traffic unit" is hereby
defined as the transportation for a distance of
one (1) mile of one (1) barrel of oil, one (1)
gallon of gasoline or one thousand (1,000) cubic
feet of natural or casinghead gas, as the case
may be.
ENR. H. B. NO. 2646 Page 9

(5) In the case of a telephone or telegraph or other
communication enterprise, the numerator of the
fraction shall include that portion of the
interstate revenue as is allocated pursuant to
the accounting procedures prescribed by the
Federal Communications Commission; provided that
in respect to each corporation or business entity
required by the Federal Communications Commission
to keep its books and records in accordance with
a uniform system of accounts prescribed by such
Commission, the intrastate net income shall be
determined separately in the manner provided by
such uniform system of accounts and only the
interstate income shall be subject to allocation
pursuant to the provisions of this subsection.
Provided further, that the gross revenue factors
shall be those as are determined pursuant to the
accounting procedures prescribed by the Federal
Communications Commission.
In any case where the apportionment of the three factors
prescribed in this paragraph attributes to Oklahoma this state a
portion of net income of the enterprise out of all appropriate
proportion to the property owned and/or business transacted within
this state, because of the fact that one or more of the factors so
prescribed are not employed to any appreciable extent in furtherance
of the enterprise; or because one or more factors not so prescribed
are employed to a considerable extent in furtherance of the
enterprise; or because of other reasons, the Tax Commission is
empowered to permit, after a showing by taxpayer that an excessive
portion of net income has been attributed to Oklahoma this state, or
require, when in its judgment an insufficient portion of net income
has been attributed to Oklahoma this state, the elimination,
substitution, or use of additional factors, or reduction or increase
in the weight of such prescribed factors. Provided, however, that
any such variance from such prescribed factors which has the effect
of increasing the portion of net income attributable to Oklahoma
this state must not be inherently arbitrary, and application of the
recomputed final apportionment to the net income of the enterprise
must attribute to Oklahoma this state only a reasonable portion
thereof.
6. For calendar years 1997 and 1998, the owner of a new or
expanded agricultural commodity processing facility in this state
may exclude from Oklahoma taxable income, or in the case of an
ENR. H. B. NO. 2646 Page 10

individual, the Oklahoma adjusted gross income, fifteen percent
(15%) of the investment by the owner in the new or expanded
agricultural commodity processing facility. For calendar year 1999,
and all subsequent years, the percentage, not to exceed fifteen
percent (15%), available to the owner of a new or expanded
agricultural commodity processing facility in this state claiming
the exemption shall be adjusted annually so that the total estimated
reduction in tax liability does not exceed One Million Dollars
($1,000,000.00) annually. The Tax Commission shall promulgate rules
for determining the percentage of the investment which each eligible
taxpayer may exclude. The exclusion provided by this paragraph
shall be taken in the taxable year when the investment is made. In
the event the total reduction in tax liability authorized by this
paragraph exceeds One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) in any
calendar year, the Tax Commission shall permit any excess over One
Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) and shall factor such excess into
the percentage for subsequent years. Any amount of the exemption
permitted to be excluded pursuant to the provisions of this
paragraph but not used in any year may be carried forward as an
exemption from income pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph
for a period not exceeding six (6) years following the year in which
the investment was originally made.
For purposes of this paragraph:
a. "Agricultural commodity processing facility" means
building buildings, structures, fixtures and
improvements used or operated primarily for the
processing or production of marketable products from
agricultural commodities. The term shall also mean a
dairy operation that requires a depreciable investment
of at least Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars
($250,000.00) and which produces milk from dairy cows.
The term does not include a facility that provides
only, and nothing more than, storage, cleaning, drying
or transportation of agricultural commodities, and
b. "Facility" means each part of the facility which is
used in a process primarily for:
(1) the processing of agricultural commodities,
including receiving or storing agricultural
commodities, or the production of milk at a dairy
operation,
ENR. H. B. NO. 2646 Page 11

(2) transporting the agricultural commodities or
product before, during or after the processing,
or
(3) packaging or otherwise preparing the product for
sale or shipment.
7. Despite any provision to the contrary in paragraph 3 of this
subsection, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1999, in

shall be considered a net operating loss carryback in accordance
with and to the extent of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended, 26 U.S.C., Section 172(b)(G) 172(b)(1)(B). However, the
amount of the net operating loss carryback shall not exceed the
lesser of:
a. Sixty Thousand Dollars ($60,000.00), or
b. the loss properly shown on Schedule F of the Internal
Revenue Service Form 1040 reduced by one-half (1/2) of
the income from all other sources other than reflected
on Schedule F.
8. In taxable years beginning after December 31, 1995, all
qualified wages equal to the federal income tax credit set forth in
26 U.S.C.A., Section 45A, shall be deducted from taxable income.
The deduction allowed pursuant to this paragraph shall only be
permitted for the tax years in which the federal tax credit pursuant
to 26 U.S.C.A., Section 45A, is allowed. For purposes of this
paragraph, "qualified wages" means those wages used to calculate the
federal credit pursuant to 26 U.S.C.A., Section 45A.
9. In taxable years beginning after December 31, 2005, an

utilized.
10. For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2010,
there shall be added to Oklahoma taxable income an amount equal to
the amount of deferred income not included in such taxable income
pursuant to Section 108(i)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986
as amended by Section 1231 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment
Act of 2009 (P.L. No. 111-5). There shall be subtracted from
ENR. H. B. NO. 2646 Page 12

Oklahoma taxable income an amount equal to the amount of deferred
income included in such taxable income pursuant to Section 108(i)(1)
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as amended by Section 1231 of
the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (P.L. No. 111-5).
11. For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2019,
there shall be subtracted from Oklahoma taxable income or adjusted
gross income any item of income or gain, and there shall be added to
Oklahoma taxable income or adjusted gross income any item of loss or

be allocated to a member or to an indirect member of an electing
pass-through entity pursuant to Section 2351 et seq. of this title,
if (i) the electing pass-through entity has accounted for such item
in computing its Oklahoma net entity income or loss pursuant to the
provisions of the Pass-Through Entity Tax Equity Act of 2019, and
(ii) the total amount of tax attributable to any resulting Oklahoma
net entity income has been paid. The Oklahoma Tax Commission shall
promulgate rules for the reporting of such exclusion to direct and
indirect members of the electing pass-through entity. As used in
this paragraph, "electing pass-through entity", "indirect member",
and "member" shall be defined in the same manner as prescribed by
Section 2355.1P-2 of this title. Notwithstanding the application of
this paragraph, the adjusted tax basis of any ownership interest in
a pass-through entity for purposes of Section 2351 et seq. of this
title shall be equal to its adjusted tax basis for federal income
tax purposes.
B. 1. The taxable income of any corporation shall be further
adjusted to arrive at Oklahoma taxable income, except those
corporations electing treatment as provided in subchapter S of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, 26 U.S.C., Section 1361
et seq., and Section 2365 of this title, deductions pursuant to the
provisions of the Accelerated Cost Recovery System as defined

Public Law 97-34, 26 U.S.C., Section 168, for depreciation of assets
placed into service after December 31, 1981, shall not be allowed in
calculating Oklahoma taxable income. Such corporations shall be
allowed a deduction for depreciation of assets placed into service

Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, 26 U.S.C., Section 1 et
seq., in effect immediately prior to the enactment of the
Accelerated Cost Recovery System. The Oklahoma tax basis for all
such assets placed into service after December 31, 1981, calculated
ENR. H. B. NO. 2646 Page 13

in this section shall be retained and utilized for all Oklahoma
income tax purposes through the final disposition of such assets.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Oklahoma Income Tax
Act, Section 2351 et seq. of this title, or of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended, to the contrary, this subsection shall
control calculation of depreciation of assets placed into service
after December 31, 1981, and before January 1, 1983.
For assets placed in service and held by a corporation in which
accelerated cost recovery system the Accelerated Cost Recovery
System was previously disallowed, an adjustment to taxable income is
required in the first taxable year beginning after December 31,
1982, to reconcile the basis of such assets to the basis allowed in
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The purpose of this
adjustment is to equalize the basis and allowance for depreciation
accounts between that reported to the Internal Revenue Service and
that reported to Oklahoma this state.
2. For tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2009, and
ending on or before December 31, 2009, there shall be added to
Oklahoma taxable income any amount in excess of One Hundred Seventy-

amended, Section 179 as provided in the American Recovery and

transferor corporation shall be allowed an exemption from taxable
income of an amount equal to the amount of royalty payment received
as a result of such transfer; provided, however, such amount shall
not exceed ten percent (10%) of the amount of gross proceeds
received by such transferor corporation as a result of the
technology transfer. Such exemption shall be allowed for a period
not to exceed ten (10) years from the date of receipt of the first
royalty payment accruing from such transfer. No exemption may be
claimed for transfers of technology to qualified small businesses
made prior to January 1, 1988.

corporations, estates or trusts shall be allowed a deduction from
Oklahoma taxable income for the amount of qualifying gains receiving

the taxable year and included in the federal taxable income of such
corporation, estate or trust.
2. As used in this subsection:
