21 adjusted gross income for individuals, as follows:
22 1. There shall be added interest income on obligations of any
23 state or political subdivision thereto which is not otherwise
24 exempted pursuant to other laws of this state, to the extent that
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2646 Page 1
1 such interest is not included in taxable income and adjusted gross
2 income.
3 2. There shall be deducted amounts included in such income that
4 the state is prohibited from taxing because of the provisions of the
5 Federal United States Constitution, the State Oklahoma Constitution,
6 federal laws or laws of Oklahoma.
7 3. The amount of any federal net operating loss deduction shall
8 be adjusted as follows:
9 a. For carryovers and carrybacks to taxable years
10 beginning before January 1, 1981, the amount of any
11 net operating loss deduction allowed to a taxpayer for
12 federal income tax purposes shall be reduced to an
13 amount which is the same portion thereof as the loss
14 from sources within this state, as determined pursuant
15 to this section and Section 2362 of this title, for
16 the taxable year in which such loss is sustained is of
17 the total loss for such year;
18 b. For carryovers and carrybacks to taxable years
19 beginning after December 31, 1980, the amount of any
20 net operating loss deduction allowed for the taxable
21 year shall be an amount equal to the aggregate of the

17 business or commercial situs apart from the
18 domicile of the taxpayer such income shall be
19 allocated in accordance with such business or
20 commercial situs; interest income from
21 investments held to generate working capital for
22 a unitary business enterprise shall be included
23 in apportionable income; a resident trust or
24 resident estate shall be treated as having a

1 separate commercial or business situs insofar as
2 undistributed income is concerned, but shall not
3 be treated as having a separate commercial or
4 business situs insofar as distributed income is
5 concerned,
6 (2) for taxable years beginning after December 31,
7 2003, capital or ordinary gains or losses from
8 the sale of an ownership interest in a publicly
9 traded partnership, as defined by Section 7704(b)
10 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,
11 shall be allocated to this state in the ratio of
12 the original cost of such partnership's tangible
13 property in this state to the original cost of
14 such partnership's tangible property everywhere,
15 as determined at the time of the sale; if more
16 than fifty percent (50%) of the value of the
17 partnership's assets consists of intangible
18 assets, capital or ordinary gains or losses from

17 d. In the case of a manufacturing or processing
18 enterprise the business of which in Oklahoma this
19 state consists solely of marketing its products by:

7 within the state where the shipment to such
8 warehouses is not covered by "in transit"
9 tariffs, as prescribed and allowed by the
10 Interstate Commerce Commission, to a purchaser
11 within or without the state,
12 the Oklahoma net income shall, at the option of the
13 taxpayer, be that portion of the total net income of
14 the taxpayer for federal income tax purposes derived
15 from the manufacture and/or processing and sales
16 everywhere as determined by the ratio of the sales
17 defined in this section made to the purchaser within
18 the state to the total sales everywhere. The term

1 provided pursuant to the provisions of paragraphs 1
2 and 2 of this subsection, apportioned as follows:
3 (1) except as otherwise provided by division (2) of
4 this subparagraph, taxable income of an insurance
5 company for a taxable year shall be apportioned
6 to this state by multiplying such income by a
7 fraction, the numerator of which is the direct
8 premiums written for insurance on property or
9 risks in this state, and the denominator of which
10 is the direct premiums written for insurance on
11 property or risks everywhere. For purposes of
12 this subsection, the term "direct premiums
13 written" means the total amount of direct
14 premiums written, assessments and annuity
15 considerations as reported for the taxable year
16 on the annual statement filed by the company with
17 the Insurance Commissioner in the form approved
18 by the National Association of Insurance
19 Commissioners, or such other form as may be
20 prescribed in lieu thereof,
21 (2) if the principal source of premiums written by an
22 insurance company consists of premiums for
23 reinsurance accepted by it, the taxable income of
24 such company shall be apportioned to this state
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2646 Page 8
1 by multiplying such income by a fraction, the
2 numerator of which is the sum of (a) direct
3 premiums written for insurance on property or
4 risks in this state, plus (b) premiums written
5 for reinsurance accepted in respect of property
6 or risks in this state, and the denominator of
7 which is the sum of (c) direct premiums written
8 for insurance on property or risks everywhere,
9 plus (d) premiums written for reinsurance
10 accepted in respect of property or risks
11 everywhere. For purposes of this paragraph,
12 premiums written for reinsurance accepted in
13 respect of property or risks in this state,
14 whether or not otherwise determinable, may at the
15 election of the company be determined on the
16 basis of the proportion which premiums written
17 for insurance accepted from companies
18 commercially domiciled in Oklahoma this state
19 bears to premiums written for reinsurance
20 accepted from all sources, or alternatively in
21 the proportion which the sum of the direct
22 premiums written for insurance on property or
23 risks in this state by each ceding company from
24 which reinsurance is accepted bears to the sum of
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2646 Page 9
1 the total direct premiums written by each such
2 ceding company for the taxable year.
3 5. The net income or loss remaining after the separate
4 allocation in paragraph 4 of this subsection, being that which is
5 derived from a unitary business enterprise, shall be apportioned to
6 this state on the basis of the arithmetical average of three factors
7 consisting of property, payroll and sales or gross revenue
8 enumerated as subparagraphs a, b and c of this paragraph. Net
9 income or loss as used in this paragraph includes that derived from
10 patent or copyright royalties, purchase discounts, and interest on
11 accounts receivable relating to or arising from a business activity,
12 the income from which is apportioned pursuant to this subsection,
13 including the sale or other disposition of such property and any
14 other property used in the unitary enterprise. Deductions used in
15 computing such net income or loss shall not include taxes based on
16 or measured by income. Provided, for corporations whose property
17 for purposes of the tax imposed by Section 2355 of this title has an
18 initial investment cost equaling or exceeding Two Hundred Million
19 Dollars ($200,000,000.00) and such investment is made on or after
20 July 1, 1997, or for corporations which expand their property or
21 facilities in this state and such expansion has an investment cost
22 equaling or exceeding Two Hundred Million Dollars ($200,000,000.00)
23 over a period not to exceed three (3) years, and such expansion is
24 commenced on or after January 1, 2000, the three factors shall be
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2646 Page 10
1 appo rtioned with property and payroll, each comprising twenty-five
2 percent (25%) of the apportionment factor and sales comprising fifty
3 percent (50%) of the apportionment factor. The apportionment
4 factors shall be computed as follows:
5 a. The property factor is a fraction, the numerator of
6 which is the average value of the taxpayer's real and
7 tangible personal property owned or rented and used in
8 this state during the tax period and the denominator
9 of which is the average value of all the taxpayer's
10 real and tangible personal property everywhere owned
11 or rented and used during the tax period.
12 (1) Property, the income from which is separately
13 allocated in paragraph 4 of this subsection,
14 shall not be included in determining this
15 fraction. The numerator of the fraction shall
16 include a portion of the investment in
17 transportation and other equipment having no
18 fixed situs, such as rolling stock, buses, trucks
19 and trailers, including machinery and equipment
20 carried thereon, airplanes, salespersons'
21 automobiles and other similar equipment, in the
22 proportion that miles traveled in Oklahoma this
23 state by such equipment bears to total miles
24 traveled,
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2646 Page 11
1 (2) Property owned by the taxpayer is valued at its
2 original cost. Property rented by the taxpayer
3 is valued at eight times the net annual rental
4 rate. Net annual rental rate is the annual
5 rental rate paid by the taxpayer, less any annual
6 rental rate received by the taxpayer from
7 subrentals,
8 (3) The average value of property shall be determined
9 by averaging the values at the beginning and
10 ending of the tax period but the Oklahoma Tax
11 Commission may require the averaging of monthly
12 values during the tax period if reasonably
13 required to reflect properly the average value of
14 the taxpayer's property;
15 b. The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of
16 which is the total compensation for services rendered
17 in the state during the tax period, and the
18 denominator of which is the total compensation for
19 services rendered everywhere during the tax period.
20 "Compensation", as used in this subsection, means
21 those paid-for services to the extent related to the
22 unitary business but does not include officers'
23 salaries, wages and other compensation.
24
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2646 Page 12
1 (1) In the case of a transportation enterprise, the
2 numerator of the fraction shall include a portion
3 of such expenditure in connection with employees
4 operating equipment over a fixed route, such as
5 railroad employees, airline pilots, or bus
6 drivers, in this state only a part of the time,
7 in the proportion that mileage traveled in
8 Oklahoma this state bears to total mileage
9 traveled by such employees,
10 (2) In any case the numerator of the fraction shall
11 include a portion of such expenditures in
12 connection with itinerant employees, such as
13 traveling salespersons, in this state only a part
14 of the time, in the proportion that time spent in
15 Oklahoma this state bears to total time spent in
16 furtherance of the enterprise by such employees;
17 c. The sales factor is a fraction, the numerator of which
18 is the total sales or gross revenue of the taxpayer in
19 this state during the tax period, and the denominator
20 of which is the total sales or gross revenue of the
21 taxpayer everywhere during the tax period. "Sales",
22 as used in this subsection, does not include sales or
23 gross revenue which are separately allocated in
24 paragraph 4 of this subsection.
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2646 Page 13
1 (1) Sales of tangible personal property have a situs
2 in this state if the property is delivered or
3 shipped to a purchaser other than the United
4 States government, within this state regardless
5 of the FOB Freight on Board (FOB) point or other
6 conditions of the sale; or the property is
7 shipped from an office, store, warehouse, factory
8 or other place of storage in this state and (a)
9 the purchaser is the United States government or
10 (b) the taxpayer is not doing business in the
11 state of the destination of the shipment.
12 (2) In the case of a railroad or interurban railway
13 enterprise, the numerator of the fraction shall
14 not be less than the allocation of revenues to
15 this state as shown in its annual report to the
16 Corporation Commission.
17 (3) In the case of an airline, truck or bus
18 enterprise or freight car, tank car, refrigerator
19 car or other railroad equipment enterprise, the
20 numerator of the fraction shall include a portion
21 of revenue from interstate transportation in the
22 proportion that interstate mileage traveled in
23 Oklahoma this state bears to total interstate
24 mileage traveled.
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2646 Page 14
1 (4) In the case of an oil, gasoline or gas pipeline
2 enterprise, the numerator of the fraction shall
3 be either the total of traffic units of the
4 enterprise within Oklahoma this state or the
5 revenue allocated to Oklahoma this state based
6 upon miles moved, at the option of the taxpayer,
7 and the denominator of which shall be the total
8 of traffic units of the enterprise or the revenue
9 of the enterprise everywhere as appropriate to
10 the numerator. A "traffic unit" is hereby
11 defined as the transportation for a distance of
12 one (1) mile of one (1) barrel of oil, one (1)
13 gallon of gasoline or one thousand (1,000) cubic
14 feet of natural or casinghead gas, as the case
15 may be.
16 (5) In the case of a telephone or telegraph or other
17 communication enterprise, the numerator of the
18 fraction shall include that portion of the
19 interstate revenue as is allocated pursuant to
20 the accounting procedures prescribed by the
21 Federal Communications Commission; provided that
22 in respect to each corporation or business entity
23 required by the Federal Communications Commission
24 to keep its books and records in accordance with
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2646 Page 15
1 a uniform system of accounts prescribed by such
2 Commission, the intrastate net income shall be
3 determined separately in the manner provided by
4 such uniform system of accounts and only the
5 interstate income shall be subject to allocation
6 pursuant to the provisions of this subsection.
7 Provided further, that the gross revenue factors
8 shall be those as are determined pursuant to the
9 accounting procedures prescribed by the Federal
10 Communications Commission.
11 In any case where the apportionment of the three factors
12 prescribed in this paragraph attributes to Oklahoma this state a
13 portion of net income of the enterprise out of all appropriate
14 proportion to the property owned and/or business transacted within
15 this state, because of the fact that one or more of the factors so
16 prescribed are not employed to any appreciable extent in furtherance
17 of the enterprise; or because one or more factors not so prescribed
18 are employed to a considerable extent in furtherance of the
19 enterprise; or because of other reasons, the Tax Commission is
20 empowered to permit, after a showing by taxpayer that an excessive
21 portion of net income has been attributed to Oklahoma this state, or
22 require, when in its judgment an insufficient portion of net income
23 has been attributed to Oklahoma this state, the elimination,
24 substitution, or use of additional factors, or reduction or increase
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2646 Page 16
1 in t he weight of such prescribed factors. Provided, however, that
2 any such variance from such prescribed factors which has the effect
3 of increasing the portion of net income attributable to Oklahoma
4 this state must not be inherently arbitrary, and application of the
5 recomputed final apportionment to the net income of the enterprise
6 must attribute to Oklahoma this state only a reasonable portion
7 thereof.
8 6. For calendar years 1997 and 1998, the owner of a new or
9 expanded agricultural commodity processing facility in this state
10 may exclude from Oklahoma taxable income, or in the case of an
11 individual, the Oklahoma adjusted gross income, fifteen percent
12 (15%) of the investment by the owner in the new or expanded
13 agricultural commodity processing facility. For calendar year 1999,
14 and all subsequent years, the percentage, not to exceed fifteen
15 percent (15%), available to the owner of a new or expanded
16 agricultural commodity processing facility in this state claiming
17 the exemption shall be adjusted annually so that the total estimated
18 reduction in tax liability does not exceed One Million Dollars
19 ($1,000,000.00) annually. The Tax Commission shall promulgate rules
20 for determining the percentage of the investment which each eligible
21 taxpayer may exclude. The exclusion provided by this paragraph
22 shall be taken in the taxable year when the investment is made. In
23 the event the total reduction in tax liability authorized by this
24 paragraph exceeds One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) in any
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2646 Page 17
1 cale ndar year, the Tax Commission shall permit any excess over One
2 Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) and shall factor such excess into
3 the percentage for subsequent years. Any amount of the exemption
4 permitted to be excluded pursuant to the provisions of this
5 paragraph but not used in any year may be carried forward as an
6 exemption from income pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph
7 for a period not exceeding six (6) years following the year in which
8 the investment was originally made.
9 For purposes of this paragraph:
10 a. "Agricultural commodity processing facility" means
11 building buildings, structures, fixtures and
12 improvements used or operated primarily for the
13 processing or production of marketable products from
14 agricultural commodities. The term shall also mean a
15 dairy operation that requires a depreciable investment
16 of at least Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars
17 ($250,000.00) and which produces milk from dairy cows.
18 The term does not include a facility that provides
19 only, and nothing more than, storage, cleaning, drying
20 or transportation of agricultural commodities, and
21 b. "Facility" means each part of the facility which is
22 used in a process primarily for:
23 (1) the processing of agricultural commodities,
24 including receiving or storing agricultural
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2646 Page 18
1 commodities, or the production of milk at a dairy
2 operation,
3 (2) transporting the agricultural commodities or
4 product before, during or after the processing,
5 or
6 (3) packaging or otherwise preparing the product for
7 sale or shipment.
8 7. Despite any provision to the contrary in paragraph 3 of this
9 subsection, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1999, in
10 the case of a taxpayer which has a farming loss, such farming loss
11 shall be considered a net operating loss carryback in accordance
12 with and to the extent of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
13 amended, 26 U.S.C., Section 172(b)(G) 172(b)(1)(B). However, the
14 amount of the net operating loss carryback shall not exceed the
15 lesser of:
16 a. Sixty Thousand Dollars ($60,000.00), or
17 b. the loss properly shown on Schedule F of the Internal
18 Revenue Service Form 1040 reduced by one-half (1/2) of
19 the income from all other sources other than reflected

22 qualified wages equal to the federal income tax credit set forth in
23 26 U.S.C.A., Section 45A, shall be deducted from taxable income.

ENGR. H. B. NO. 2646 Page 19
1 perm itted for the tax years in which the federal tax credit pursuant
2 to 26 U.S.C.A., Section 45A, is allowed. For purposes of this
3 paragraph, "qualified wages" means those wages used to calculate the
4 federal credit pursuant to 26 U.S.C.A., Section 45A.
5 9. In taxable years beginning after December 31, 2005, an
6 employer that is eligible for and utilizes the Safety Pays OSHA
7 Consultation Service provided by the Oklahoma Department of Labor
8 shall receive an exemption from taxable income in the amount of One
9 Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00) for the tax year that the service is
10 utilized.

12 there shall be added to Oklahoma taxable income an amount equal to
13 the amount of deferred income not included in such taxable income
14 pursuant to Section 108(i)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986
15 as amended by Section 1231 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment
16 Act of 2009 (P.L. No. 111-5). There shall be subtracted from
17 Oklahoma taxable income an amount equal to the amount of deferred
18 income included in such taxable income pursuant to Section 108(i)(1)
19 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as amended by Section 1231 of

2 provisions of the Pass-Through Entity Tax Equity Act of 2019 would
3 be allocated to a member or to an indirect member of an electing
4 pass-through entity pursuant to Section 2351 et seq. of this title,
5 if (i) the electing pass-through entity has accounted for such item
6 in computing its Oklahoma net entity income or loss pursuant to the
7 provisions of the Pass-Through Entity Tax Equity Act of 2019, and
8 (ii) the total amount of tax attributable to any resulting Oklahoma
9 net entity income has been paid. The Oklahoma Tax Commission shall
10 promulgate rules for the reporting of such exclusion to direct and
11 indirect members of the electing pass-through entity. As used in
12 this paragraph, "electing pass-through entity", "indirect member",
13 and "member" shall be defined in the same manner as prescribed by
14 Section 2355.1P-2 of this title. Notwithstanding the application of

11 regularly traded on an established securities market within one (1)
12 year of the date on which it first becomes a real estate investment
13 trust shall be deemed not to have been regularly traded on an
14 established securities market, retroactive to the date it first
15 became a real estate investment trust, and shall file an amended
16 return reflecting such retroactive designation for any tax year or
17 part year occurring during its initial year of status as a real

21 adjusted gross income for individuals, as follows:
22 1. There shall be added interest income on obligations of any
23 state or political subdivision thereto which is not otherwise
24 exempted pursuant to other laws of this state, to the extent that
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2646 Page 1

1 such interest is not included in taxable income and adjusted gross
2 income.
3 2. There shall be deducted amounts included in such income that
4 the state is prohibited from taxing because of the provisions of the
5 Federal United States Constitution, the State Oklahoma Constitution,
6 federal laws or laws of Oklahoma.
7 3. The amount of any federal net operating loss deduction shall
8 be adjusted as follows:
9 a. For carryovers and carrybacks to taxable years
10 beginning before January 1, 1981, the amount of any
11 net operating loss deduction allowed to a taxpayer for

13 amount which is the same portion thereof as the loss
14 from sources within this state, as determined pursuant
15 to this section and Section 2362 of this title, for
16 the taxable year in which such loss is sustained is of
17 the total loss for such year;
18 b. For carryovers and carrybacks to taxable years
19 beginning after December 31, 1980, the amount of any
20 net operating loss deduction allowed for the taxable

1 4. Items of the following nature shall be allocated as
2 indicated. Allowable deductions attributable to items separately

12 interest, dividends, patent or copyright royalties,
13 and gains or losses from sales of such property, shall

16 (1) where such property has acquired a nonunitary
17 business or commercial situs apart from the
18 domicile of the taxpayer such income shall be
19 allocated in accordance with such business or
20 commercial situs; interest income from
21 investments held to generate working capital for
22 a unitary business enterprise shall be included
23 in apportionable income; a resident trust or
24 resident estate shall be treated as having a
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2646 Page 4

1 separate commercial or business situs insofar as
2 undistributed income is concerned, but shall not
3 be treated as having a separate commercial or
4 business situs insofar as distributed income is
5 concerned,
6 (2) for taxable years beginning after December 31,
7 2003, capital or ordinary gains or losses from
8 the sale of an ownership interest in a publicly
9 traded partnership, as defined by Section 7704(b)
10 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,
11 shall be allocated to this state in the ratio of
12 the original cost of such partnership's tangible
13 property in this state to the original cost of
14 such partnership's tangible property everywhere,
15 as determined at the time of the sale; if more
16 than fifty percent (50%) of the value of the
17 partnership's assets consists of intangible
18 assets, capital or ordinary gains or losses from
19 the sale of an ownership interest in the
20 partnership shall be allocated to this state in
21 accordance with the sales factor of the
22 partnership for its first full tax period
23 immediately preceding its tax period during which
24 the ownership interest in the partnership was
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2646 Page 5

1 sold; the provisions of this division shall only
2 apply if the capital or ordinary gains or losses
3 from the sale of an ownership interest in a
4 partnership do not constitute qualifying gain
5 receiving capital treatment as defined in
6 subparagraph a of paragraph 2 of subsection F of
7 this section,
8 (3) income from such property which is required to be

13 not a part of business carried on within or without
14 the state of a unitary character shall be separately
15 allocated to the state in which such activity is
16 conducted;
17 d. In the case of a manufacturing or processing
18 enterprise the business of which in Oklahoma this
19 state consists solely of marketing its products by:
20 (1) sales having a situs without this state, shipped
21 directly to a point from without the state to a
22 purchaser within the state, commonly known as
23 interstate sales,
24
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2646 Page 6

1 (2) sales of the product stored in public warehouses
2 within the state pursuant to "in transit"
3 tariffs, as prescribed and allowed by the
4 Interstate Commerce Commission, to a purchaser
5 within the state,
6 (3) sales of the product stored in public warehouses
7 within the state where the shipment to such
8 warehouses is not covered by "in transit"
9 tariffs, as prescribed and allowed by the
10 Interstate Commerce Commission, to a purchaser
11 within or without the state,
12 the Oklahoma net income shall, at the option of the
13 taxpayer, be that portion of the total net income of
14 the taxpayer for federal income tax purposes derived
15 from the manufacture and/or processing and sales
16 everywhere as determined by the ratio of the sales
17 defined in this section made to the purchaser within
18 the state to the total sales everywhere. The term
19 "public warehouse" as used in this subparagraph means
20 a licensed public warehouse, the principal business of
21 which is warehousing merchandise for the public;
22 e. In the case of insurance companies, Oklahoma taxable
23 income shall be taxable income of the taxpayer for
24 federal tax purposes, as adjusted for the adjustments
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2646 Page 7

1 provided pursuant to the provisions of paragraphs 1
2 and 2 of this subsection, apportioned as follows:
3 (1) except as otherwise provided by division (2) of
4 this subparagraph, taxable income of an insurance
5 company for a taxable year shall be apportioned
6 to this state by multiplying such income by a
7 fraction, the numerator of which is the direct
8 premiums written for insurance on property or
9 risks in this state, and the denominator of which
10 is the direct premiums written for insurance on
11 property or risks everywhere. For purposes of
12 this subsection, the term "direct premiums
13 written" means the total amount of direct
14 premiums written, assessments and annuity
15 considerations as reported for the taxable year
16 on the annual statement filed by the company with
17 the Insurance Commissioner in the form approved
18 by the National Association of Insurance
19 Commissioners, or such other form as may be
20 prescribed in lieu thereof,
21 (2) if the principal source of premiums written by an
22 insurance company consists of premiums for
23 reinsurance accepted by it, the taxable income of
24 such company shall be apportioned to this state
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2646 Page 8

1 by multiplying such income by a fraction, the
2 numerator of which is the sum of (a) direct
3 premiums written for insurance on property or
4 risks in this state, plus (b) premiums written
5 for reinsurance accepted in respect of property
6 or risks in this state, and the denominator of
7 which is the sum of (c) direct premiums written
8 for insurance on property or risks everywhere,
9 plus (d) premiums written for reinsurance
10 accepted in respect of property or risks
11 everywhere. For purposes of this paragraph,
12 premiums written for reinsurance accepted in
13 respect of property or risks in this state,
14 whether or not otherwise determinable, may at the
15 election of the company be determined on the
16 basis of the proportion which premiums written
17 for insurance accepted from companies
18 commercially domiciled in Oklahoma this state
19 bears to premiums written for reinsurance
20 accepted from all sources, or alternatively in
21 the proportion which the sum of the direct
22 premiums written for insurance on property or
23 risks in this state by each ceding company from
24 which reinsurance is accepted bears to the sum of
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2646 Page 9

1 the total direct premiums written by each such
2 ceding company for the taxable year.
3 5. The net income or loss remaining after the separate
4 allocation in paragraph 4 of this subsection, being that which is
5 derived from a unitary business enterprise, shall be apportioned to
6 this state on the basis of the arithmetical average of three factors
7 consisting of property, payroll and sales or gross revenue
8 enumerated as subparagraphs a, b and c of this paragraph. Net
9 income or loss as used in this paragraph includes that derived from
10 patent or copyright royalties, purchase discounts, and interest on
11 accounts receivable relating to or arising from a business activity,
12 the income from which is apportioned pursuant to this subsection,
13 including the sale or other disposition of such property and any
14 other property used in the unitary enterprise. Deductions used in
15 computing such net income or loss shall not include taxes based on
16 or measured by income. Provided, for corporations whose property
17 for purposes of the tax imposed by Section 2355 of this title has an
18 initial investment cost equaling or exceeding Two Hundred Million
19 Dollars ($200,000,000.00) and such investment is made on or after
20 July 1, 1997, or for corporations which expand their property or
21 facilities in this state and such expansion has an investment cost
22 equaling or exceeding Two Hundred Million Dollars ($200,000,000.00)
23 over a period not to exceed three (3) years, and such expansion is
24 commenced on or after January 1, 2000, the three factors shall be
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2646 Page 10

1 appo rtioned with property and payroll, each comprising twenty-five
2 percent (25%) of the apportionment factor and sales comprising fifty
3 percent (50%) of the apportionment factor. The apportionment
4 factors shall be computed as follows:
5 a. The property factor is a fraction, the numerator of
6 which is the average value of the taxpayer's real and
7 tangible personal property owned or rented and used in
8 this state during the tax period and the denominator
9 of which is the average value of all the taxpayer's
10 real and tangible personal property everywhere owned
11 or rented and used during the tax period.
12 (1) Property, the income from which is separately
13 allocated in paragraph 4 of this subsection,
14 shall not be included in determining this
15 fraction. The numerator of the fraction shall
16 include a portion of the investment in
17 transportation and other equipment having no
18 fixed situs, such as rolling stock, buses, trucks
19 and trailers, including machinery and equipment
20 carried thereon, airplanes, salespersons'
21 automobiles and other similar equipment, in the
22 proportion that miles traveled in Oklahoma this
23 state by such equipment bears to total miles
24 traveled,
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2646 Page 11

1 (2) Property owned by the taxpayer is valued at its
2 original cost. Property rented by the taxpayer
3 is valued at eight times the net annual rental
4 rate. Net annual rental rate is the annual
5 rental rate paid by the taxpayer, less any annual
6 rental rate received by the taxpayer from
7 subrentals,
8 (3) The average value of property shall be determined
9 by averaging the values at the beginning and
10 ending of the tax period but the Oklahoma Tax
11 Commission may require the averaging of monthly
12 values during the tax period if reasonably
13 required to reflect properly the average value of
14 the taxpayer's property;
15 b. The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of
16 which is the total compensation for services rendered
17 in the state during the tax period, and the
18 denominator of which is the total compensation for
19 services rendered everywhere during the tax period.
20 "Compensation", as used in this subsection, means
21 those paid-for services to the extent related to the
22 unitary business but does not include officers'
23 salaries, wages and other compensation.
24
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2646 Page 12

1 (1) In the case of a transportation enterprise, the
2 numerator of the fraction shall include a portion
3 of such expenditure in connection with employees
4 operating equipment over a fixed route, such as
5 railroad employees, airline pilots, or bus
6 drivers, in this state only a part of the time,
7 in the proportion that mileage traveled in
8 Oklahoma this state bears to total mileage
9 traveled by such employees,
10 (2) In any case the numerator of the fraction shall
11 include a portion of such expenditures in
12 connection with itinerant employees, such as
13 traveling salespersons, in this state only a part
14 of the time, in the proportion that time spent in
15 Oklahoma this state bears to total time spent in
16 furtherance of the enterprise by such employees;
17 c. The sales factor is a fraction, the numerator of which
18 is the total sales or gross revenue of the taxpayer in
19 this state during the tax period, and the denominator
20 of which is the total sales or gross revenue of the
21 taxpayer everywhere during the tax period. "Sales",
22 as used in this subsection, does not include sales or
23 gross revenue which are separately allocated in
24 paragraph 4 of this subsection.
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2646 Page 13

1 (1) Sales of tangible personal property have a situs
2 in this state if the property is delivered or
3 shipped to a purchaser other than the United
4 States government, within this state regardless
5 of the FOB Freight on Board (FOB) point or other
6 conditions of the sale; or the property is
7 shipped from an office, store, warehouse, factory
8 or other place of storage in this state and (a)
9 the purchaser is the United States government or
10 (b) the taxpayer is not doing business in the
11 state of the destination of the shipment.
12 (2) In the case of a railroad or interurban railway
13 enterprise, the numerator of the fraction shall
14 not be less than the allocation of revenues to
15 this state as shown in its annual report to the
16 Corporation Commission.
17 (3) In the case of an airline, truck or bus
18 enterprise or freight car, tank car, refrigerator
19 car or other railroad equipment enterprise, the
20 numerator of the fraction shall include a portion
21 of revenue from interstate transportation in the
22 proportion that interstate mileage traveled in
23 Oklahoma this state bears to total interstate
24 mileage traveled.
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2646 Page 14

1 (4) In the case of an oil, gasoline or gas pipeline
2 enterprise, the numerator of the fraction shall
3 be either the total of traffic units of the
4 enterprise within Oklahoma this state or the
5 revenue allocated to Oklahoma this state based
6 upon miles moved, at the option of the taxpayer,
7 and the denominator of which shall be the total
8 of traffic units of the enterprise or the revenue
9 of the enterprise everywhere as appropriate to
10 the numerator. A "traffic unit" is hereby
11 defined as the transportation for a distance of
12 one (1) mile of one (1) barrel of oil, one (1)
13 gallon of gasoline or one thousand (1,000) cubic
14 feet of natural or casinghead gas, as the case
15 may be.
16 (5) In the case of a telephone or telegraph or other
17 communication enterprise, the numerator of the
18 fraction shall include that portion of the
19 interstate revenue as is allocated pursuant to
20 the accounting procedures prescribed by the
21 Federal Communications Commission; provided that
22 in respect to each corporation or business entity
23 required by the Federal Communications Commission
24 to keep its books and records in accordance with
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2646 Page 15

1 a uniform system of accounts prescribed by such
2 Commission, the intrastate net income shall be
3 determined separately in the manner provided by
4 such uniform system of accounts and only the
5 interstate income shall be subject to allocation
6 pursuant to the provisions of this subsection.
7 Provided further, that the gross revenue factors
8 shall be those as are determined pursuant to the
9 accounting procedures prescribed by the Federal
10 Communications Commission.
11 In any case where the apportionment of the three factors
12 prescribed in this paragraph attributes to Oklahoma this state a
13 portion of net income of the enterprise out of all appropriate
14 proportion to the property owned and/or business transacted within
15 this state, because of the fact that one or more of the factors so
16 prescribed are not employed to any appreciable extent in furtherance
17 of the enterprise; or because one or more factors not so prescribed
18 are employed to a considerable extent in furtherance of the
19 enterprise; or because of other reasons, the Tax Commission is
20 empowered to permit, after a showing by taxpayer that an excessive
21 portion of net income has been attributed to Oklahoma this state, or
22 require, when in its judgment an insufficient portion of net income
23 has been attributed to Oklahoma this state, the elimination,
24 substitution, or use of additional factors, or reduction or increase
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2646 Page 16

1 in t he weight of such prescribed factors. Provided, however, that
2 any such variance from such prescribed factors which has the effect
3 of increasing the portion of net income attributable to Oklahoma
4 this state must not be inherently arbitrary, and application of the
5 recomputed final apportionment to the net income of the enterprise
6 must attribute to Oklahoma this state only a reasonable portion
7 thereof.
8 6. For calendar years 1997 and 1998, the owner of a new or
9 expanded agricultural commodity processing facility in this state
10 may exclude from Oklahoma taxable income, or in the case of an
11 individual, the Oklahoma adjusted gross income, fifteen percent
12 (15%) of the investment by the owner in the new or expanded
13 agricultural commodity processing facility. For calendar year 1999,
14 and all subsequent years, the percentage, not to exceed fifteen
15 percent (15%), available to the owner of a new or expanded
16 agricultural commodity processing facility in this state claiming
17 the exemption shall be adjusted annually so that the total estimated
18 reduction in tax liability does not exceed One Million Dollars
19 ($1,000,000.00) annually. The Tax Commission shall promulgate rules
20 for determining the percentage of the investment which each eligible
21 taxpayer may exclude. The exclusion provided by this paragraph
22 shall be taken in the taxable year when the investment is made. In
23 the event the total reduction in tax liability authorized by this
24 paragraph exceeds One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) in any
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2646 Page 17

1 cale ndar year, the Tax Commission shall permit any excess over One
2 Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) and shall factor such excess into
3 the percentage for subsequent years. Any amount of the exemption
4 permitted to be excluded pursuant to the provisions of this
5 paragraph but not used in any year may be carried forward as an
6 exemption from income pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph
7 for a period not exceeding six (6) years following the year in which
8 the investment was originally made.
9 For purposes of this paragraph:
10 a. "Agricultural commodity processing facility" means
11 building buildings, structures, fixtures and
12 improvements used or operated primarily for the
13 processing or production of marketable products from
14 agricultural commodities. The term shall also mean a
15 dairy operation that requires a depreciable investment
16 of at least Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars
17 ($250,000.00) and which produces milk from dairy cows.
18 The term does not include a facility that provides
19 only, and nothing more than, storage, cleaning, drying
20 or transportation of agricultural commodities, and
21 b. "Facility" means each part of the facility which is
22 used in a process primarily for:
23 (1) the processing of agricultural commodities,
24 including receiving or storing agricultural
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2646 Page 18

1 commodities, or the production of milk at a dairy
2 operation,
3 (2) transporting the agricultural commodities or
4 product before, during or after the processing,
5 or
