20 is created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:
21 A. The term "assistant funeral director" as herein used means a
22 person who assists a duly Oklahoma licensed funeral director in one
23 or more of the principal functions of funeral directing, and is
24 actively engaged in such work. An assistant funeral director shall
Req. No. 13333 Page 1

2 employee is registered, and shall be a person to whom the funeral
3 director-in-charge delegates the responsibility of conducting
4 funeral services, making funeral arrangements, and making
5 interments.
6 B. The Oklahoma Funeral Board may, in its discretion, license
7 assistant funeral directors to each Oklahoma-licensed funeral
8 director-in-charge. The funeral director-in-charge shall have only
9 one assistant funeral director. Licensure as an assistant funeral
10 director shall be separate and distinct from registration as an
11 apprentice funeral director and/or embalmer. The Board may issue an
12 assistant funeral director license on successful completion of the
13 Oklahoma Funeral Board Law examination, the manner and form of which
14 is to be determined by the Board, and upon the payment of the
15 application fee which shall include the license fee for the current
16 year or portion thereof, and such application and registration and
17 renewal fee shall be in the amount fixed by the Board in accordance
18 with the provision of Section 396.4 of Title 59 of the Oklahoma
19 Statutes. Before issuing a license to an applicant for an assistant
20 funeral director's license, the Board shall require satisfactory
21 proof that the applicant is capable and trustworthy to act as such
22 and that the applicant is a person of good moral character, has a
23 good standing in the community and is qualified to engage in the
24 business. In determining the moral character of any such applicant,
Req. No. 13333 Page 2
1 the Board shall take into consideration any felony conviction of
2 such person, but such conviction shall not automatically operate as
3 a bar to licensure. Each person applying for an assistant funeral
4 director's license shall make application and be recommended in
5 writing on forms provided by the Board. The application shall show
6 that the applicant is at least eighteen (18) years of age and shall
7 have at least sixty (60) semester hours of study earned, measured in
8 quarter or clock hours, from a regionally accredited college or
9 university before such license can be issued to the applicant. Upon
10 issuing a license to an assistant funeral director, as herein
11 provided, the Board shall cause the licensee to be registered under
12 the supervision of the Oklahoma-licensed funeral director by whom
13 such licensee is employed and under whom such licensee is
14 registered. The funeral director under whom the assistant funeral
15 director has been registered must immediately notify the Board when
16 the licensee has left the director's employ. Upon the re-employment
17 of the licensee by any other funeral director-in-charge, such
18 licensee shall be reinstated by the Board. The work of an assistant
19 funeral director shall at all times be under the supervision and
20 control of the Oklahoma licensed funeral director under whom the
21 licensee is registered. Licenses of assistant funeral directors may
22 be suspended or revoked, or the Board may refuse to issue or renew
23 the same, for any of the reasons and in the manner stated herein for
24 funeral directors' licenses.

7 education in accordance with the provision of Section 396.5b of
8 Title 59 of the Oklahoma Statutes.
