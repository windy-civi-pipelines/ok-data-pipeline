1 dire ctor-in-charge delegates the responsibility of conducting
2 funeral services, making funeral arrangements, and making
3 interments.
4 B. The Oklahoma Funeral Board may, in its discretion, license
5 assistant funeral directors to each Oklahoma-licensed funeral
6 director-in-charge. The funeral director-in-charge shall have only
7 one assistant funeral director. Licensure as an assistant funeral
8 director shall be separate and distinct from registration as an
9 apprentice funeral director and/or embalmer. The Board may issue an
10 assistant funeral director license on successful completion of the
11 Oklahoma Funeral Board Law examination, the manner and form of which
12 is to be determined by the Board, and upon the payment of the
13 application fee which shall include the license fee for the current
14 year or portion thereof, and such application and registration and
15 renewal fee shall be in the amount fixed by the Board in accordance
16 with the provision of Section 396.4 of Title 59 of the Oklahoma
17 Statutes. Before issuing a license to an applicant for an assistant
18 funeral director's license, the Board shall require satisfactory
19 proof that the applicant is capable and trustworthy to act as such
20 and that the applicant is a person of good moral character, has a
21 good standing in the community and is qualified to engage in the
22 business. In determining the moral character of any such applicant,
23 the Board shall take into consideration any felony conviction of
24 such person, but such conviction shall not automatically operate as

2 director's license shall make application and be recommended in
3 writing on forms provided by the Board. The application shall show
4 that the applicant is at least eighteen (18) years of age and shall
5 have at least sixty (60) semester hours of study earned, measured in
6 quarter or clock hours, from a regionally accredited college or
7 university before such license can be issued to the applicant. Upon
8 issuing a license to an assistant funeral director, as herein
9 provided, the Board shall cause the licensee to be registered under
10 the supervision of the Oklahoma-licensed funeral director by whom
11 such licensee is employed and under whom such licensee is
12 registered. The funeral director under whom the assistant funeral
13 director has been registered must immediately notify the Board when
14 the licensee has left the director's employ. Upon the re-employment
15 of the licensee by any other funeral director-in-charge, such
16 licensee shall be reinstated by the Board. The work of an assistant
17 funeral director shall at all times be under the supervision and
18 control of the Oklahoma-licensed funeral director under whom the
19 licensee is registered. Licenses of assistant funeral directors may
20 be suspended or revoked, or the Board may refuse to issue or renew
21 the same, for any of the reasons and in the manner stated herein for
22 funeral directors' licenses.
23 C. The expiration date of each license shall be December 31.
24 Subject to the provisions of this section, each license shall be
