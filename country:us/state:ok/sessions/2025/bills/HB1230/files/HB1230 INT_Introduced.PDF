14 one (1) day a week for three (3) consecutive weeks in
15 a newspaper authorized by law to publish legal notices
16 which is published in the county where the petition is
17 filed. If no newspaper authorized by law to publish
18 legal notices is published in such county, the notice
19 shall be published in some such newspaper of general

12 barring the defendant from asserting any interest
13 in or to the property is sought or will be

8 e. Before entry of a default judgment or order against a
9 party who has been served solely by publication under
10 this paragraph, the court shall conduct an inquiry to
11 determine whether the plaintiff, or someone acting in
12 behalf of the plaintiff, made a distinct and
13 meaningful search of all reasonably available sources
14 to ascertain the whereabouts of any named parties who
15 have been served solely by publication under this
16 paragraph. Before entry of a default judgment or

13 The title to any property which is the subject of and
14 which passes to a purchaser in good faith by or in
15 consequence of the judgment or order to be opened
16 shall not be affected by any proceedings under this
17 subparagraph. Nor shall proceedings under this
18 subparagraph affect the title of any property sold
19 before judgment under an attachment. The adverse
20 party, on the hearing of an application to open a
21 judgment or order as provided by this subparagraph,
22 shall be allowed to present evidence to show that
23 during the pendency of the action the applicant had
24

4 administrators, devisees, trustees and assigns,
5 immediate and remote, of a named individual,

8 in personal jurisdiction over a defendant who is not

12 this state.

7 foreign insurance company doing business in this
8 state.
9 5. 6. SERVICE BY ACKNOWLEDGMENT. An acknowledgment on the back

13 personal delivery or, by mail, or by secured electronic means, a
14 defendant of any class referred to in division (1) or (3) of
15 subparagraph c of paragraph 1 of this subsection may be served as
16 provided by court order in a manner which is reasonably calculated

2 or witness.
3 D. SUMMONS AND PETITION. The summons and petition shall be
4 served together. The plaintiff shall furnish the person making
5 service with such copies as are necessary. The failure to serve a
6 copy of the petition with the summons is not a ground for dismissal
7 for insufficiency of service of process, but on motion of the party
8 served, the court may extend the time to answer or otherwise plead.
9 If a summons and petition are served by personal delivery, the
10 person serving the summons shall state on the copy that is left with
11 the person served the date that service is made. This provision is
12 not jurisdictional, but if the failure to comply with it prejudices
13 the party served, the court, on motion of the party served, may
14 extend the time to answer or otherwise plead.
