13 required to reflect properly the average value of
14 the taxpayer's property;

11 prescribed in this paragraph attributes to this state a portion of
12 net income of the enterprise out of all appropriate proportion to
13 the property owned and/or business transacted within this state,
14 because of the fact that one or more of the factors so prescribed
15 are not employed to any appreciable extent in furtherance of the
16 enterprise; or because one or more factors not so prescribed are
17 employed to a considerable extent in furtherance of the enterprise;
18 or because of other reasons, the Tax Commission is empowered to
19 permit, after a showing by taxpayer that an excessive portion of net
20 income has been attributed to this state, or require, when in its
21 judgment an insufficient portion of net income has been attributed
22 to this state, the elimination, substitution, or use of additional
23 factors, or reduction or increase in the weight of such prescribed
24 factors. Provided, however, that any such variance from such
Req. No. 11073 Page 16
1 pres cribed factors which has the effect of increasing the portion of
2 net income attributable to this state must not be inherently
3 arbitrary, and application of the recomputed final apportionment to

18 for determining the percentage of the investment which each eligible
19 taxpayer may exclude. The exclusion provided by this paragraph

6 which is the average value of the taxpayer's real and
7 tangible personal property owned or rented and used in

7 subrentals,
8 (3) The average value of property shall be determined
9 by averaging the values at the beginning and

11 Commission may require the averaging of monthly
12 values during the tax period if reasonably
13 required to reflect properly the average value of
14 the taxpayer's property;
15 b. The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of
16 which is the total compensation for services rendered

6 drivers, in this state only a part of the time,
7 in the proportion that mileage traveled in this
8 state bears to total mileage traveled by such
9 employees,
10 (2) In any case the numerator of the fraction shall
11 include a portion of such expenditures in
12 connection with itinerant employees, such as
13 traveling salespersons, in this state only a part
14 of the time, in the proportion that time spent in
15 this state bears to total time spent in
16 furtherance of the enterprise by such employees;

18 is the total sales or gross revenue of the taxpayer in
19 this state during the tax period, and the denominator
20 of which is the total sales or gross revenue of the
21 taxpayer everywhere during the tax period. "Sales",
22 as used in this subsection, does not include sales or
23 gross revenue which are separately allocated in
24 paragraph 4 of this subsection.
Req. No. 11073 Page 13

18 enterprise or freight car, tank car, refrigerator
19 car or other railroad equipment enterprise, the
20 numerator of the fraction shall include a portion
21 of revenue from interstate transportation in the
22 proportion that interstate mileage traveled in

24 traveled.
Req. No. 11073 Page 14

10 numerator. A "traffic unit" is hereby defined as
11 the transportation for a distance of one (1) mile
12 of one (1) barrel of oil, one (1) gallon of
13 gasoline or one thousand (1,000) cubic feet of
14 natural or casinghead gas, as the case may be.

16 communication enterprise, the numerator of the
17 fraction shall include that portion of the

4 interstate income shall be subject to allocation
5 pursuant to the provisions of this subsection.
6 Provided further, that the gross revenue factors
7 shall be those as are determined pursuant to the
8 accounting procedures prescribed by the Federal
9 Communications Commission.
10 In any case where the apportionment of the three factors
11 prescribed in this paragraph attributes to this state a portion of
12 net income of the enterprise out of all appropriate proportion to
13 the property owned and/or business transacted within this state,
14 because of the fact that one or more of the factors so prescribed
15 are not employed to any appreciable extent in furtherance of the
16 enterprise; or because one or more factors not so prescribed are
17 employed to a considerable extent in furtherance of the enterprise;
18 or because of other reasons, the Tax Commission is empowered to
19 permit, after a showing by taxpayer that an excessive portion of net
20 income has been attributed to this state, or require, when in its
21 judgment an insufficient portion of net income has been attributed
22 to this state, the elimination, substitution, or use of additional
23 factors, or reduction or increase in the weight of such prescribed
24 factors. Provided, however, that any such variance from such
Req. No. 11073 Page 16

1 pres cribed factors which has the effect of increasing the portion of
2 net income attributable to this state must not be inherently
3 arbitrary, and application of the recomputed final apportionment to
4 the net income of the enterprise must attribute to this state only a
5 reasonable portion thereof.
6 6. For calendar years 1997 and 1998, the owner of a new or
7 expanded agricultural commodity processing facility in this state
8 may exclude from Oklahoma taxable income, or in the case of an
9 individual, the Oklahoma adjusted gross income, fifteen percent

11 agricultural commodity processing facility. For calendar year 1999,
12 and all subsequent years, the percentage, not to exceed fifteen
13 percent (15%), available to the owner of a new or expanded
14 agricultural commodity processing facility in this state claiming
15 the exemption shall be adjusted annually so that the total estimated
16 reduction in tax liability does not exceed One Million Dollars
17 ($1,000,000.00) annually. The Tax Commission shall promulgate rules
18 for determining the percentage of the investment which each eligible
19 taxpayer may exclude. The exclusion provided by this paragraph
20 shall be taken in the taxable year when the investment is made. In
21 the event the total reduction in tax liability authorized by this
22 paragraph exceeds One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) in any
23 calendar year, the Tax Commission shall permit any excess over One
24 Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) and shall factor such excess into
Req. No. 11073 Page 17

1 the percentage for subsequent years. Any amount of the exemption
2 permitted to be excluded pursuant to the provisions of this
