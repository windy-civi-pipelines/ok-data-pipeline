12 WHEREAS, the Legislature of the State of Oklahoma, acting with
13 the best of intentions, has, at various times, and during
14 various sessions, previously made applications to the Congress of
15 the United States of America to call one or more conventions to
16 propose either one or more amendments regarding one or more specific
17 subjects or purposes, or to call a general convention to propose an
18 unspecified and unlimited number of amendments to the United States
19 Constitution, pursuant to the provisions of Article V thereof; and
20 WHEREAS, the Declaration of Independence proclaims that "it is
21 the Right of the People to alter or to abolish" their form of
22 government whenever it fails to secure their rights, which implies
23 that a convention of representatives of the sovereign people in an

1 Arti cle V "convention for proposing amendments" would have the
2 inherent power to propose sweeping changes to the Constitution (also
3 known as a "runaway" convention), any limitations or restrictions
4 purportedly imposed by the states in applying for such a convention
5 or conventions to the contrary notwithstanding, thereby creating an
6 imminent peril to the well-established rights of the citizens and
7 the duties of various levels of government as defined by our present
8 Constitution; and
9 WHEREAS, the Constitution of the United States of America has
10 been amended many times in the history of this nation and may be
11 amended many more times, without the need to resort to an Article V
12 constitutional convention, and has been interpreted for more than
13 two hundred years and has been found to be a sound document which
14 protects the lives and liberties of the citizens; and
15 WHEREAS, there is no need for, rather, there is great danger in,
16 subjecting our form of government, which is based on the
17 Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, to sweeping
18 changes that would undermine its philosophical foundation of
19 instituting government based on the principle of securing God-given
20 rights; and
21 WHEREAS, the best solution for reining in the federal government
22 is an informed electorate which will hold public officials

1 acco untable to our existing Constitution with its principles of
2 limited government, rather than risking a runaway Article V
3 convention.
4 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
5 OF THE 1ST SESSION OF THE 60TH OKLAHOMA LEGISLATURE, THE SENATE
6 CONCURRING THEREIN:
7 THAT the Legislature does hereby rescind, repeal, cancel,
8 nullify, and supersede to the same effect as if they had never been
9 passed, any and all extant applications by the Legislature of the
10 State of Oklahoma to the Congress of the United States of America to
11 call a convention to propose amendments to the Constitution of the
12 United States of America, pursuant to the terms of Article V
13 thereof, regardless of when or by which session or sessions of the
14 Oklahoma Legislature such applications were made and regardless of
15 whether such applications were for a limited convention to
16 propose one or more amendments regarding one or more specific
17 subjects or purposes or for a general convention to propose an
18 unlimited number of amendments upon an unlimited number of subjects.
19 THAT the Oklahoma Legislature urges the legislatures of each and
20 every state which has applied to Congress to call a convention for
21 either a general or a limited constitutional convention, to repeal,
22 and withdraw such applications.
23 THAT copies of this Resolution be transmitted to the Secretary
24 of State, to the presiding officers of both houses of the
