RESOLUTION 1002 By: Olsen

6 AS INTRODUCED
7 A Concurrent Resolution rescinding certain prior
requests to Congress for an Article V Constitutional
8 Convention.

11 WHEREAS, the Legislature of the State of Oklahoma, acting with
12 the best of intentions, has, at various times, and during
13 various sessions, previously made applications to the Congress of
14 the United States of America to call one or more conventions to
15 propose either one or more amendments regarding one or more specific
16 subjects or purposes, or to call a general convention to propose an
17 unspecified and unlimited number of amendments to the United States
18 Constitution, pursuant to the provisions of Article V thereof; and
19 WHEREAS, the Declaration of Independence proclaims that "it is
20 the Right of the People to alter or to abolish" their form of
21 government whenever it fails to secure their rights, which implies
22 that a convention of representatives of the sovereign people in an
23 Article V "convention for proposing amendments" would have the
24 inherent power to propose sweeping changes to the Constitution (also

1 know n as a "runaway" convention), any limitations or restrictions
2 purportedly imposed by the states in applying for such a convention
3 or conventions to the contrary notwithstanding, thereby creating an
4 imminent peril to the well-established rights of the citizens and
5 the duties of various levels of government as defined by our present
6 Constitution; and
7 WHEREAS, the Constitution of the United States of America has
8 been amended many times in the history of this nation and may be
9 amended many more times, without the need to resort to an Article V
10 constitutional convention, and has been interpreted for more than
11 two hundred years and has been found to be a sound document which
12 protects the lives and liberties of the citizens; and
13 WHEREAS, there is no need for, rather, there is great danger in,
14 subjecting our form of government, which is based on the
15 Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, to sweeping
16 changes that would undermine its philosophical foundation of
17 instituting government based on the principle of securing God-given
18 rights; and
19 WHEREAS, the best solution for reining in the federal government
20 is an informed electorate which will hold public officials
21 accountable to our existing Constitution with its principles of
22 limited government, rather than risking a runaway Article V
23 convention.

8 call a convention to propose amendments to the Constitution of the
9 United States of America, pursuant to the terms of Article V
10 thereof, regardless of when or by which session or sessions of the
11 Oklahoma Legislature such applications were made and regardless of
12 whether such applications were for a limited convention to

14 subjects or purposes or for a general convention to propose an
15 unlimited number of amendments upon an unlimited number of subjects.
16 THAT the Oklahoma Legislature urges the legislatures of each and
