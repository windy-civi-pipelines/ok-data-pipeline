23
24
record of the meeting as required by law, and any time the lowest
24
Req. No. 922 Page 6

1
bid was not considered to be the lowest and best bid, the reason for
1
2
such conclusion shall be recorded. Whenever the board of county
2
3
commissioners rejects the written recommendation of the
3
4
requisitioning official pertaining to a special item, the reasons

for the rejection shall be entered in their minutes and stated in a

officer of the list. The county purchasing agent may remove any
11
12
vendor from such list who refuses to provide goods or services as
12

13
14
county commissioners. The county purchasing agent may make
14
15
purchases from the successful bidders for a price at or below the
15
16
bid price. If a vendor who is the low bidder cannot or will not
16
17
sell goods or services as required by a county bid contract, the
17
18
county purchasing agent may make a one-time purchase from the next
18
19
lowest or best quote or take quotations as provided in paragraph 6
19
20
of this subsection; provided, however, such purchase does not exceed
20
21
Twenty-five Thousand Dollars ($25,000.00) as the amount specified in

2
3
a. the county purchasing agent shall determine if
3
4
potential vendors are willing to commit to a firm
4
5
price for a reduced period of time, and, if such is
5
6
the case, the bid procedure described in this
6
7
subsection shall be followed,
7
8
b. if vendors are not willing to commit to a firm price
8
9
for a reduced period, the purchasing agent shall
9
10
solicit and record at least three quotes of current
10
11
prices available to the county and authorize the
11
12
purchase of goods or services based on the lowest and
12
13
best quote as it becomes necessary to acquire such
13
14
goods or services. The quotes shall be recorded on a
14
15
form prescribed by the State Auditor and Inspector and
15
16
shall be attached to the purchase order and filed with
16
17
the county clerk’s copy of the purchase order. Any
17
18
time the lowest quote was not considered to be the
18
19
lowest and best quote, the reason for this conclusion
19
20
shall be recorded by the county purchasing agent and
20
21
transmitted to the county clerk, or
21
22
c. if three quotes are not available, a memorandum to the
