19 provided by contract if the removal is authorized by the board of
20 county commissioners. The county purchasing agent may make
21 purchases from the successful bidders for a price at or below the
22 bid price. If a vendor who is the low bidder cannot or will not

14 for a reduced period, the purchasing agent shall
15 solicit and record at least three quotes of current
16 prices available to the county and authorize the

20 form prescribed by the State Auditor and Inspector and
