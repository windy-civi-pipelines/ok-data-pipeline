with the out-of-state health care provider, the Board shall
reimburse for medical services and treatment rendered and charged by
an out-of-state health care provider at least at the same percentage
level as the network percentage level of the fee schedule
established by the Oklahoma Employees Insurance and Benefits Board
if the insured employee was referred to the out-of-state health care
provider by a physician or it was an emergency situation and the
out-of-state provider was the closest in proximity to the place of

seq., and

the health and dental insurance plans offered through the Oklahoma

Employees Insurance and Benefits Act, the board of education shall
be prohibited from withdrawing the school district from such
participation. If a majority of those eligible employees voting at
the election vote against continued participation in the health and
dental insurance plans offered through the Oklahoma Employees
Insurance and Benefits Act, the board of education of the school
district shall apply to discontinue such participation within thirty
(30) days of the election and within the times the school district
is authorized to withdraw from participation in accordance with
rules established for withdrawal by the Office Authority.
