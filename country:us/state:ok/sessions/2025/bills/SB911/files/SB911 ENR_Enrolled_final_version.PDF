Section 3-113. CONDITIONAL FACTORS.
For each calendar year commencing after December 31, 2006,
except for those employers with a benefit wage ratio of zero (0) and
as otherwise provided in this section, the contribution rate for

circumstances and in the amounts as follows:
(1) - Condition “a” - If the balance of the unemployment
compensation fund is less than three and one-half (3 1/2) times, but
not less than three (3) times, the net benefits paid for the most
recent twenty (20) consecutive completed calendar quarters divided
by five (5), on July 1 of any given year, the contribution rate for
the next calendar year for each employer whose benefit wage ratio
with respect to that year is zero percent (0%) shall be increased by
one-tenth of one percent (1/10 of 1%) of wages paid by the employer
during the year; the contribution rate for each employer whose
benefit rate wage ratio with respect to that year is more than zero
percent (0%), but not more than one-tenth of one percent (1/10 of
1%), shall be increased by two-tenths of one percent (2/10 of 1%) of
wages paid by the employer during the year and the contribution rate
for each employer whose benefit wage ratio with respect to that year
is more than one-tenth of one percent (1/10 of 1%), shall be

for the next calendar year for each employer shall be increased by
thirty-three and one-third percent (33 1/3%) of the rate; provided
that the total rate, if not a multiple of one-tenth of one percent
(1/10 of 1%), shall be computed to the next higher multiple of one-
tenth of one percent (1/10 of 1%) of wages paid by the employer
during that year; provided, further, that the contribution rate for

for the next calendar year for each employer shall be increased by
one-half (1/2) of that rate; provided that the total rate, if not a
multiple of one-tenth of one percent (1/10 of 1%), shall be computed
to the next higher multiple of one-tenth of one percent (1/10 of 1%)
of wages paid by the employer during that year; provided, further,
that the contribution rate for each employer whose benefit wage
ratio with respect to that year is zero percent (0%) shall be

ENR. S. B. NO. 911 Page 21

1%) of wages paid by the employer during that year; the contribution
rate for each employer whose benefit wage ratio with respect to that

be increased by sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3 %) of the
rate; provided that the total rate, if not a multiple of one-tenth

respect to that year is zero percent (0%) shall be increased by
four-tenths two-tenths of one percent (4/10 (2/10 of 1%) of wages
paid by the employer during that year; the contribution rate for

(5) The contribution rate, excluding any surcharge, for an
employer whose contribution rate is three and four-tenths percent
(3.4%) or more shall not be increased by more than two (2)
ENR. S. B. NO. 911 Page 22

percentage points in any two (2) consecutive years. The
contribution rate, excluding any surcharge, for an employer whose
contribution rate is less than three and four-tenths percent (3.4%)
shall not be increased to more than five and four-tenths percent
(5.4%) in one (1) year.
For the purposes of this section “net benefits paid for the most
recent twenty (20) consecutive completed calendar quarters” means
the total amount of monies withdrawn from this state’s account in
the unemployment trust fund in the United States Treasury for each
of the most recent twenty (20) consecutive completed calendar
quarters, plus the balance in the benefit account at the start of
the period, less the balance in the benefit account at the end of
the period. The contribution rate for those employers with a
benefit wage ratio of zero (0) shall be two-tenths of one percent
(2/10 of 1%) during those years when the fund is in conditions “a”,
“b”, and “c”, and shall be three-tenths of one percent (3/10 of 1%)
during those years when the fund is in condition “d”.
(6) Beginning January 1, 1996, except for this paragraph and
paragraph (7) of this section, the provisions of this section shall
be suspended until the Unemployment Trust Fund reaches a High Cost
Multiple of one and one-fourth (1 1/4). The Oklahoma Employment
Security Commission shall determine the High Cost Multiple at the
end of each calendar year and shall include the result of its
computation in a regularly published periodical together with other
employment-related data. As used in this section, “High Cost
Multiple” shall be a figure computed as follows:
(a) first, net fund reserves in the Unemployment
Compensation Fund as of the date of each computation
required by this section shall be divided by total
wages earned in insured employment for the twelve (12)
months preceding the date of the quarterly High Cost
Multiple computation,
(b) second, the result of the computation from
subparagraph (a) of this paragraph shall be divided by
a figure which is a quotient derived from the
computation of the High-Cost Rate contained in
subparagraph (c) of this paragraph, and
ENR. S. B. NO. 911 Page 23

(c) third, the highest ratio of total state benefit
payments experienced previously in any twelve (12)
consecutive months to total wages earned in insured
employment for the same period shall be the High-Cost
Rate.
The result of all computations contained in subparagraphs (a)
through (c) of this paragraph, performed in the sequence as
specified in this section, shall be known as the High Cost
Multiple;.
(7) Prior to the beginning of each calendar year, the
Commission shall prepare an estimate of the financial condition of
the trust fund. If the estimate for the year shows the balance, at
any time during the year, will fall below the High Cost Multiple as
defined in paragraph (6) of this section, then the Commission shall
reinstate the suspended provisions of this section.
SECTION 4. AMENDATORY 40 O.S. 2021, Section 3-114, is
amended to read as follows:
Section 3-114. ESTIMATE OF FINANCIAL CONDITION OF FUND -
SURCHARGE. Prior to the beginning of each calendar quarter, the
Oklahoma Employment Security Commission shall prepare an estimate of
the financial condition of the fund for the quarter. If the
estimate for any quarter shows a balance at any time during the
quarter of less than Twenty-five Million Dollars ($25,000,000.00)
Fifty Million Dollars ($50,000,000.00), the Commission shall assess
and collect a surcharge for that calendar quarter in an amount
sufficient to keep the balance at Twenty-five Million Dollars
($25,000,000.00) Fifty Million Dollars ($50,000,000.00), except as
otherwise provided in this section.
The surcharge shall be charged to each employer in proportion to
the employer’s total tax liability as of the last completed quarter
for the current calendar year and shall not exceed thirty-three and
one-third percent (33 1/3%) per taxable year.
In a state of emergency declared by the Governor, the Oklahoma
Legislature, the United States President or the U.S. Congress, the
Commission shall have the following authority:
ENR. S. B. NO. 911 Page 24

1. If a state of emergency directly and adversely impacts the
fund and if the estimate for any quarter in a declared state of
emergency shows a balance at any time during the quarter of less
than Twenty-five Million Dollars ($25,000,000.00) Fifty Million
Dollars ($50,000,000.00), the Commission shall have authority to:
a. claim up to twenty-five percent (25%) of the federal
emergency relief funds made available to the state, if
any,
b. decrease the surcharge to be charged to each employer
to a percentage rate that is sufficient to bring the
balance of the fund to Twenty-five Million Dollars
($25,000,000.00) Fifty Million Dollars
($50,000,000.00),
c. borrow federal funds in amounts determined necessary
by the Commission,
d. allow the balance of the fund to remain less than
Twenty-five Million Dollars ($25,000,000.00) Fifty
Million Dollars ($50,000,000.00) but not less than Ten
Million Dollars ($10,000,000.00), or
e. use any combination of the provisions of subparagraph
a, b, c or d of this subsection to supplement the
fund; and
2. When a state of emergency does not directly impact the fund,
the Commission shall adhere to the required duty to assess and
collect a surcharge for that calendar quarter in an amount
sufficient to keep the fund balance at Twenty-five Million Dollars
($25,000,000.00) Fifty Million Dollars ($50,000,000.00).
SECTION 5. This act shall become effective November 1, 2025.
