2 Multiple” shall be a figure computed as follows:
3 (a) first, net fund reserves in the Unemployment
4 Compensation Fund as of the date of each computation
5 required by this section shall be divided by total
6 wages earned in insured employment for the twelve (12)
7 months preceding the date of the quarterly High Cost
8 Multiple computation,
9 (b) second, the result of the computation from
10 subparagraph (a) of this paragraph shall be divided by
11 a figure which is a quotient derived from the
12 computation of the High-Cost Rate contained in
13 subparagraph (c) of this paragraph, and
14 (c) third, the highest ratio of total state benefit
15 payments experienced previously in any twelve (12)
16 consecutive months to total wages earned in insured
17 employment for the same period shall be the High-Cost
18 Rate.
19 The result of all computations contained in subparagraphs (a)
20 through (c) of this paragraph, performed in the sequence as
21 specified in this section, shall be known as the High Cost
22 Multiple;.
23 (7) Prior to the beginning of each calendar year, the
24 Commission shall prepare an estimate of the financial condition of

3 defined in paragraph (6) of this section, then the Commission shall
4 reinstate the suspended provisions of this section.
5 SECTION 4. AMENDATORY 40 O.S. 2021, Section 3-114, is

12 quarter of less than Twenty-five Million Dollars ($25,000,000.00)
13 Fifty Million Dollars ($50,000,000.00), the Commission shall assess
14 and collect a surcharge for that calendar quarter in an amount
15 sufficient to keep the balance at Twenty-five Million Dollars
16 ($25,000,000.00) Fifty Million Dollars ($50,000,000.00), except as
17 otherwise provided in this section.
18 The surcharge shall be charged to each employer in proportion to

20 for the current calendar year and shall not exceed thirty-three and
21 one-third percent (33 1/3%) per taxable year.
22 In a state of emergency declared by the Governor, the Oklahoma

1 1. If a state of emergency directly and adversely impacts the
2 fund and if the estimate for any quarter in a declared state of
3 emergency shows a balance at any time during the quarter of less
4 than Twenty-five Million Dollars ($25,000,000.00) Fifty Million
5 Dollars ($50,000,000.00), the Commission shall have authority to:
6 a. claim up to twenty-five percent (25%) of the federal
7 emergency relief funds made available to the state, if
8 any,
9 b. decrease the surcharge to be charged to each employer
10 to a percentage rate that is sufficient to bring the
11 balance of the fund to Twenty-five Million Dollars
12 ($25,000,000.00) Fifty Million Dollars
13 ($50,000,000.00),
14 c. borrow federal funds in amounts determined necessary
15 by the Commission,
16 d. allow the balance of the fund to remain less than
17 Twenty-five Million Dollars ($25,000,000.00) Fifty
18 Million Dollars ($50,000,000.00) but not less than Ten
19 Million Dollars ($10,000,000.00), or
20 e. use any combination of the provisions of subparagraph
21 a, b, c or d of this subsection to supplement the
22 fund; and
23 2. When a state of emergency does not directly impact the fund,
24 the Commission shall adhere to the required duty to assess and
SB911 HFLR Page 26

1 coll ect a surcharge for that calendar quarter in an amount
2 sufficient to keep the fund balance at Twenty-five Million Dollars

3 (a) first, net fund reserves in the Unemployment

5 required by this section shall be divided by total
6 wages earned in insured employment for the twelve (12)
7 months preceding the date of the quarterly High Cost
8 Multiple computation,
9 (b) second, the result of the computation from

14 (c) third, the highest ratio of total state benefit
15 payments experienced previously in any twelve (12)
16 consecutive months to total wages earned in insured
17 employment for the same period shall be the High-Cost
18 Rate.
19 The result of all computations contained in subparagraphs (a)
20 through (c) of this paragraph, performed in the sequence as
21 specified in this section, shall be known as the High Cost
22 Multiple;.
23 (7) Prior to the beginning of each calendar year, the

12 quarter of less than Twenty-five Million Dollars ($25,000,000.00)
13 Fifty Million Dollars ($50,000,000.00), the Commission shall assess
14 and collect a surcharge for that calendar quarter in an amount
15 sufficient to keep the balance at Twenty-five Million Dollars
16 ($25,000,000.00) Fifty Million Dollars ($50,000,000.00), except as
17 otherwise provided in this section.
18 The surcharge shall be charged to each employer in proportion to

20 for the current calendar year and shall not exceed thirty-three and
21 one-third percent (33 1/3%) per taxable year.
22 In a state of emergency declared by the Governor, the Oklahoma

2 fund and if the estimate for any quarter in a declared state of
3 emergency shows a balance at any time during the quarter of less
4 than Twenty-five Million Dollars ($25,000,000.00) Fifty Million
5 Dollars ($50,000,000.00), the Commission shall have authority to:
6 a. claim up to twenty-five percent (25%) of the federal
7 emergency relief funds made available to the state, if
8 any,
9 b. decrease the surcharge to be charged to each employer
10 to a percentage rate that is sufficient to bring the
11 balance of the fund to Twenty-five Million Dollars
12 ($25,000,000.00) Fifty Million Dollars
13 ($50,000,000.00),
14 c. borrow federal funds in amounts determined necessary
15 by the Commission,
16 d. allow the balance of the fund to remain less than
17 Twenty-five Million Dollars ($25,000,000.00) Fifty
18 Million Dollars ($50,000,000.00) but not less than Ten
19 Million Dollars ($10,000,000.00), or
20 e. use any combination of the provisions of subparagraph
21 a, b, c or d of this subsection to supplement the
22 fund; and
23 2. When a state of emergency does not directly impact the fund,
24 the Commission shall adhere to the required duty to assess and
