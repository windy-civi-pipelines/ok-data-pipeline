10 purchase, gift, devise, or lease, acquire property, real or
11 personal, or any interest therein including easements in
12 aeronautical hazards or land outside the boundaries of an airport or
13 airport site, as are necessary to permit safe and efficient
14 operation of the state airports or to permit the removal,
15 elimination, obstruction-marking or obstruction-lighting of airport
16 hazards, or to prevent the establishment of airport hazards. In
17 like manner the Department may acquire existing airports and air
18 navigation facilities. However, the Department shall not acquire or
19 take over any airport or air navigation facility owned or controlled
20 by a municipality of this or any other state without the consent of
21 such municipality. The Department may, by sale, lease, or
22 otherwise, dispose of any such property, airport, air navigation

2 except that, in the case of disposals to any municipality or state
3 government or the United States for aeronautical purposes incident
4 thereto, the sale, lease, or other disposal may be effected in such
5 manner and upon such terms as the Department may deem in the best
6 interest of the state.
7 2. All airports owned by the state shall be within the primary
8 jurisdiction of the Oklahoma Department of Aerospace and Aeronautics
9 for purposes of design, development, and operation; provided, that
10 airports owned and operated by the Oklahoma Space Industry
11 Development Authority shall be exempt from such provisions, and
12 during the time of a national emergency, the Air National Guard
13 shall be exempt from such provisions, and provided further, that any
14 airport owned by the state may be leased by the Department to a
15 public or private agency, as it may deem fit.
16 3. Nothing contained in the Oklahoma Department of Aerospace
17 and Aeronautics Act shall be construed to limit any right, power, or
18 authority of the state or a municipality to regulate airport hazards
19 by zoning.
20 4. The Department may exercise any powers granted by this
21 section jointly with any municipalities or with the United States.
22 5. a. In operating an airport or air navigation facility

6 supplying goods, commodities, things, services, or
7 facilities at such airport or air navigation facility;
8 or making available services to be furnished by the

11 In each such case the Department may establish the
12 terms and conditions and fix the charges, rentals, or
13 fees for the privileges or services, which shall be
14 reasonable and uniform for the same class of
15 privileges or services and shall be established with
16 due regard to the property and improvements used and
17 the expenses of operation to the state; provided, that
18 in no case shall the public be deprived of its
19 rightful, equal, and uniform use of the airport, air
20 navigation facility or portion or facility thereof.
21 b. The Department may by contract, lease, or other
22 arrangement, upon a consideration fixed by it, grant
23 to any qualified person for a term not to exceed

ENGR. S. B. NO. 730 Page 9

1 agent of the state or otherwise, any airport owned or
2 controlled by the state; provided, that no such person
3 shall be granted any authority to operate the airport
4 other than as a public airport or to enter into any
5 contracts, leases, or other arrangements in connection
6 with the operation of the airport which the Department
7 might not have undertaken under subparagraph a of this
8 paragraph.
9 c. To enforce the payment of any charges for repairs to,

21 accepted on behalf of municipalities. All monies received by the
22 Department pursuant to this section shall be deposited in the
23 Oklahoma Department of Aerospace and Aeronautics Revolving Fund in
24 the State Treasury and shall be paid out of the Department Fund in
ENGR. S. B. NO. 730 Page 10

1 acco rdance with the terms and conditions of any agreement entered
2 into under the provisions of this section.
3 7. The Department shall grant no exclusive right for the use of
4 any airport or air navigation facility under its jurisdiction. This
5 shall not be construed to prevent the making of contracts, leases,
6 and other arrangements pursuant to paragraph 5 of this subsection.
7 I. J. The Department may enter into any contracts necessary to
8 the execution of the powers granted it by the Oklahoma Department of
9 Aerospace and Aeronautics Act. All contracts made by the
10 Department, either as the agent of the state or as the agent of any
11 municipality, shall be made pursuant to the laws of the state
12 governing the making of like contracts. When the planning,
13 acquisition, construction, improvement, maintenance, or operation of
14 any airport or air navigation facility is financed wholly or
15 partially with federal monies, the Department as agent of the state
16 or of any municipality may let contracts in the manner prescribed by
17 the federal authorities acting under the laws of the United States
18 and any rules or regulations made thereunder.
19 J. K. 1. The Commission, the Director, or any officer or
20 employee of the Department designated by it shall have the power to
21 hold investigations, inquiries, and hearings concerning matters
22 covered by the provisions of the Oklahoma Department of Aerospace

4 investigation, or hearing shall have the power to administer oaths
5 and affirmations, certify to all official acts, issue subpoenas, and
6 order the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production
7 of papers, books, and documents. In case of the failure of any
8 person to comply with any subpoena or order issued under the
9 authority of this subsection, or on the refusal of any witness to
10 testify to any matters regarding which he may be lawfully
11 interrogated, it shall be the duty of the district court of any
12 county or of the judge thereof, on application of the Department or
13 its authorized representative, to compel obedience by proceedings
14 for contempt, as in the case of disobedience of the requirements of
15 a subpoena issued from such court or a refusal to testify therein.
16 2. In order to facilitate the making of investigations by the
17 Department in the interest of public safety and promotion of
18 aeronautics the public interest requires, and it is therefore
19 provided, that the reports of investigations or hearings, or any
20 part thereof, shall not be admitted in evidence or used for any
21 purpose in any suit, action, or proceeding growing out of any matter
22 referred to in the investigation, hearing, or report thereof, except
23 in case of any suit, action, or proceeding, civil or criminal,
24 instituted by or in behalf of the Department or in the name of the
