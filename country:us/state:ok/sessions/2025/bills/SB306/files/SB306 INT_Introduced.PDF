SECTION 1. NEW LAW A new section of law not to be

22
23
This act shall be known and may be cited as the “Taxpayer
23
24
Protection Act”.

Req. No. 1435 Page 1

SECTION 2. NEW LAW A new section of law not to be
1
2
codified in the Oklahoma Statutes reads as follows:
2
3
This Legislature finds that:
3
4
1. Federal overreach: The Tenth Amendment to the United States
4
5
Constitution reserves powers not delegated to the federal government
5
6
to the states or the people. The Legislature finds that the Tenth
6
7
Amendment limits the scope of federal authority to those powers
7
8
explicitly enumerated;
8
9
2. Constitutional taxation: Congress’s authority to levy taxes
9
10
is explicitly limited to the powers enumerated in Sections 8 and 9
10
11
of Article I and the Sixteenth Amendment of the United States
11
12
Constitution. Federal mandates that withhold funds or impose
12
13
conditions on states fall outside these powers, infringe upon state
13
14
sovereignty, and violate the constitutional principles of federalism
14
15
protected by the Tenth Amendment;
15
16
3. Complexity of the federal tax code: The federal tax code,
16
17
exceeding seventy thousand (70,000) pages, imposes an undue burden
17
18
on citizens by being overly complex, incomprehensible, and
18
19
inaccessible. This system disproportionately penalizes average
19
20
taxpayers, facilitates selective enforcement, and serves as a tool
20
21
for unconstitutional federal overreach;
21
22
4. Unconstitutionality of the Internal Revenue Service: The
22
23
Internal Revenue Service (IRS), an unelected federal agency,
23
24
unlawfully consolidates legislative, executive, and judicial powers,
24
Req. No. 1435 Page 2

1
violating the separation of powers doctrine established by Articles
1
2
I, II, and III of the United States Constitution. Its actions
2
3
exceed Congress’s delegated authority, undermining the
3
4
constitutional framework and imposing undue harm on citizens and
4
5
states; and
5
6
5. State sovereignty: In light of unconstitutional federal
6
7
mandates and the IRS’s unauthorized authority, this state reasserts
7
8
its sovereignty under the Tenth Amendment and affirms its duty to
8
9
protect its citizens from unconstitutional federal actions,
9
10
including those perpetuated by the Internal Revenue Service and
10
11
federal tax mandates.
11
12
SECTION 3. NEW LAW A new section of law to be codified
12
13
in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 284 of Title 68, unless there is
13
14
created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:
14
15
A. There is hereby created in the State Treasury a revolving
15
16
fund for the Oklahoma Tax Commission to be designated the “Federal
16
17
Tax Fund”. The fund shall be a continuing fund, not subject to
17
18
fiscal year limitations, and shall consist of all monies received by
18
19
the Tax Commission from federal income tax withholdings, estimated
19
20
tax payments, and all other federal tax collections for remittance
20
21
collected in this state. All monies accruing to the credit of the
21
22
fund are hereby appropriated and may be budgeted and expended by the

Tax Commission for the purposes provided for in this section and

8
9
Regulations violate the United States Constitution or upon a vote
9
10
affirming the unconstitutionality of a federal sanction pursuant to
10
11
subsection A of Section 6 of this act, the Tax Commission shall
11
12
cease the quarterly disbursements as required by subsection B of
12
13
this section and transfer the funds to the Special Cash Fund of the
13
