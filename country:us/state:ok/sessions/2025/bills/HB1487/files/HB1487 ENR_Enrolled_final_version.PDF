Section 1135.3. A. Service Oklahoma is hereby authorized to
design and issue appropriate official special license plates to
persons wishing to demonstrate support, interest or membership to or
for an organization, occupation, cause or other subject as provided
by this section.

Special license plates shall not be transferred to any other
person but shall be removed from the vehicle upon transfer of
ownership and retained. The special license plate may then be used
on another vehicle but only after such other vehicle has been
registered for the current year.
Special license plates shall be renewed each year by Service
Oklahoma or a licensed operator, unless authorized by Service
Oklahoma to be renewed for a period greater than one (1) year.
Service Oklahoma shall notify by mail all persons issued special
license plates. The notice shall contain all necessary information
and shall contain instructions for the renewal procedure upon
presentation to a licensed operator or Service Oklahoma. The
license plates shall be issued on a staggered system.
On and after January 1, 2022, if a special license plate is
issued pursuant to this section, any registration fee required for
such plate pursuant to this section and the fee required pursuant to
Section 1132 of this title shall be remitted at the same time and
subject to a single registration period. Service Oklahoma shall
determine, by rule, a method for making required fee and
registration period adjustments if a special license plate is
obtained during a twelve-month period for which a registration fee
has already been remitted pursuant to Section 1132 of this title.
The combination of fees in a single remittance shall not alter the
apportionment otherwise provided for in this section.
Service Oklahoma is hereby directed to develop and implement a
system whereby licensed operators are permitted to accept
applications for special license plates authorized under this
section. The licensed operator shall confirm the applicant's
eligibility, if applicable, collect and deposit any amount
specifically authorized by law, accept and process the necessary
information directly into such system and generate a receipt
accordingly. For performance of these duties, licensed operators
shall retain the fee provided in Section 1141.1 of this title for
registration of a motor vehicle. The licensed operator fees for
acceptance of applications and renewals shall be paid out of the
Oklahoma Tax Commission Reimbursement Fund. Beginning January 1,
2023, the licensed operator fees for acceptance of applications and
renewals shall be paid out of the Service Oklahoma Reimbursement
Fund.

license plate registrant shall be allowed to display the license
plate upon the designated vehicle until the registration expiration
date. After such time the expired special license plate shall be
removed from the vehicle.
Except as otherwise provided in law, for special license plates
authorized on or after July 1, 2004, no special license plates shall
be developed or issued by Service Oklahoma until Service Oklahoma
receives one hundred (100) prepaid applications therefor. The
prepaid applications must be received by Service Oklahoma within one
hundred eighty (180) days of the effective date of the authorization
