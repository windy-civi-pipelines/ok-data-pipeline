8 physician prescriber has privileges. In such a case, all of the
9 following apply:
10 a. the patient may be required to pay out-of-pocket for
11 the prescribed off-label drug before it is ordered,
12 b. if the hospital or inpatient facility cannot obtain
13 the off-label drug being prescribed by the outpatient

10 the drug, and
11 c. the patient is not required to have been exposed to a
12 disease, illness, or infection before the pharmacist
13 dispenses the drug for prophylactic use;
14 6. Nothing in this section prevents a pharmacist from
15 discussing a prescription with the prescriber who issued the
16 prescription. The ultimate decision to accept a drug prescribed by
17 the prescriber shall be made by one of the following who has given
18 informed consent: the patient, patient's parent or guardian, or
19 person holding the patient's health care power of attorney.
20 D. A health-related licensing board, department of health,
21 state board of pharmacy, or other state board or agency responsible
22 for the licensure or regulation of health care professionals shall
23 not consider any action taken by a prescriber or pharmacist or
24 hospital or inpatient facility under this section to be unlawful,
Req. No. 10748 Page 10

8 action against a prescriber, pharmacist, or other licensed health
9 care professional or hospital or inpatient facility for publicly or
10 privately expressing a medical opinion that does not align with the
11 opinions of the board or agency, a board of health of a city or
12 county health district, or the department of health.
13 E. The World Health Organization shall have no jurisdiction in
14 this state. Therefore, no political subdivision, public official,
15 or state agency shall enforce or use any state funding to implement
16 any guideline, mandate, recommendation, or rule issued by the World
17 Health Organization that prohibits issuing a prescription for or
18 dispensing an off-label drug.
19 SECTION 2. This act shall become effective November 1, 2025.
