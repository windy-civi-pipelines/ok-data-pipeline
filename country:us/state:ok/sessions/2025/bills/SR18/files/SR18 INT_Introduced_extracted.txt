WHEREAS, the Legislature finds that the enactment into law by
12
13
the United States Congress of the federal REAL ID Act of 2005,
13
14
Public Law Number 109-13, is an action that individual Oklahomans do
14
15
have the right to refuse to comply with the enactment under the
15
16
principles of federalism protected by the Tenth Amendment to the
16
17
United States Constitution; and
17
18
WHEREAS, a REAL ID-compliant driver license or identification
18
19
card requires the collection and retention of personal and sensitive
19
20
biometric information from each applicant; and
20
21
WHEREAS, the State of Oklahoma does provide an option for
21
22
Oklahomans to choose between a REAL ID-compliant or a REAL ID-

Req. No. 2076 Page 1

WHEREAS, this choice provides a distinction without a difference
1

as the state, in fact, collects, stores, and shares all applicants’
2

personal and sensitive biometric information in exactly the same
3

manner for both the REAL ID-compliant and the REAL ID-noncompliant
4
5
option.

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE OF THE 1ST SESSION
6
7
OF THE 60TH OKLAHOMA LEGISLATURE:
7
8
THAT the Oklahoma State Senate recognizes that Oklahomans opting
8
9
out of REAL ID understand the limitations for federal purposes of
9
10
the REAL ID-noncompliant driver license or identification card, and
10
11
they expect in return that their personal information will not be
11
12
shared with the federal government absent a court-approved warrant.
12
13
THAT the Oklahoma State Senate affirms the right of Oklahomans
13
14
to refuse participation in the federal REAL ID program and urges the
14
15
State of Oklahoma to continue offering both compliant and
15
16
noncompliant identification options, and further believes that the
16
17
State of Oklahoma should protect the personal information of our
17
18
citizens who choose a REAL ID-noncompliant driver license or
18
19
identification card by prohibiting the sharing of their personal
19
20
identifiable information including biometric samples, biometric
20
21
data, or biometric templates, absent a court-approved warrant.
21
22
THAT the Oklahoma State Senate recognizes the importance of
22
23
protecting Oklahomans’ right to refuse participation in the
23
24
voluntary federal REAL ID system, supporting a genuine choice
24
Req. No. 2076 Page 2

between compliant and noncompliant IDs, and protecting Oklahomans

from both coerced compliance and the illusion of security through a
2

distinction without a difference.
