1 J. For the tax years 2020 through 2022, the total amount of
2 credits authorized by this section used to offset tax shall be
3 adjusted annually to limit the annual amount of credits to Twenty
4 Million Dollars ($20,000,000.00). The Tax Commission shall annually
5 calculate and publish by the first day of the affected taxable year
6 a percentage by which the credits authorized by this section shall
7 be reduced so the total amount of credits used to offset tax does
8 not exceed Twenty Million Dollars ($20,000,000.00) per year. The
9 formula to be used for the percentage adjustment shall be Twenty
10 Million Dollars ($20,000,000.00) divided by the credits claimed in
11 the second preceding year, with respect to any changes to the future
12 of the credit.
13 K. Pursuant to subsection J of this section, in the event the
14 total tax credits authorized by this section exceed Twenty Million
15 Dollars ($20,000,000.00) in any calendar year, the Tax Commission
16 shall permit any excess over Twenty Million Dollars ($20,000,000.00)

18 for subsequent years with respect to any changes to the future of
19 the credit.
20 L. For the tax years 2023 through 2028, the total amount of
21 credits authorized by this section used to offset tax shall be
22 adjusted annually to limit the annual amount of credits to:
23 1. Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000.00) for qualified clean
24 burning fuel property propelled by compressed natural gas, liquefied
Req. No. 12190 Page 8

1 natu ral gas, or liquefied petroleum gas, property related to the
2 delivery of compressed natural gas, liquefied natural gas or
3 liquefied petroleum gas, and property directly related to the
4 compression and delivery of natural gas;

6 equipped so that the vehicle may be propelled by a hydrogen fuel
7 cell electric fueling system and property directly related to the
8 delivery of hydrogen; and
9 3. Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000.00) for property which is a
10 metered-for-fee, public access recharging system for motor vehicles
11 propelled in whole or in part by electricity.
12 The Tax Commission shall annually calculate and publish by the
13 first day of the affected taxable year a percentage by which the
14 credits authorized by this section shall be reduced so the total
15 amount of credits used to offset tax does not exceed each of the
16 limits provided in paragraphs 1 through 3 of this subsection. The
17 formula to be used for the percentage adjustment shall be Ten
18 Million Dollars ($10,000,000.00) divided by the credits claimed in
19 the second preceding year, with respect to any changes to the future
20 of the credit.
21 M. Pursuant to subsection L of this section, in the event the
22 tax credits authorized by this section exceed any of the limits
23 provided in paragraphs 1 through 3 of subsection L of this section
24 in any year, the Tax Commission shall permit any excess over Ten
Req. No. 12190 Page 9

4 N. The Tax Commission shall notify the Office of the State
5 Secretary of Energy and Environment at any time when the amount of
6 claims for credits allowed pursuant to this section reaches eighty
7 percent (80%) of the total annual limit provided in subsection J of
8 this section. Upon such notification, the Secretary shall provide
9 notice to the Governor, President Pro Tempore of the Senate and
10 Speaker of the House of Representatives.
11 SECTION 2. This act shall become effective July 1, 2025.
12 SECTION 3. It being immediately necessary for the preservation
13 of the public peace, health or safety, an emergency is hereby
