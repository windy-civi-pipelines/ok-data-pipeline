20 calculate and publish by the first day of the affected taxable year
21 a percentage by which the credits authorized by this section shall
22 be reduced so the total amount of credits used to offset tax does
23 not exceed Twenty Million Dollars ($20,000,000.00) per year. The
24 formula to be used for the percentage adjustment shall be Twenty
Req. No. 12542 Page 7

1 Mill ion Dollars ($20,000,000.00) divided by the credits claimed in
2 the second preceding year, with respect to any changes to the future
3 of the credit.
4 K. Pursuant to subsection J of this section, in the event the
5 total tax credits authorized by this section exceed Twenty Million
6 Dollars ($20,000,000.00) in any calendar year, the Tax Commission
7 shall permit any excess over Twenty Million Dollars ($20,000,000.00)
8 but shall factor such excess into the percentage adjustment formula
9 for subsequent years with respect to any changes to the future of
10 the credit.
11 L. For the tax years 2023 through 2028, the total amount of
12 credits authorized by this section used to offset tax shall be
13 adjusted annually to limit the annual amount of credits to:
14 1. Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000.00) for qualified clean
15 burning fuel property propelled by compressed natural gas, liquefied
16 natural gas, or liquefied petroleum gas, property related to the

21 equipped so that the vehicle may be propelled by a hydrogen fuel
22 cell electric fueling system and property directly related to the
23 delivery of hydrogen; and
24
Req. No. 12542 Page 8

1 3. Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000.00) for property which is a
2 metered-for-fee, public access recharging system for motor vehicles
3 propelled in whole or in part by electricity.
4 The Tax Commission shall annually calculate and publish by the
5 first day of the affected taxable year a percentage by which the
6 credits authorized by this section shall be reduced so the total
7 amount of credits used to offset tax does not exceed each of the
8 limits provided in paragraphs 1 through 3 of this subsection. The
9 formula to be used for the percentage adjustment shall be Ten
10 Million Dollars ($10,000,000.00) divided by the credits claimed in
11 the second preceding year, with respect to any changes to the future
12 of the credit.
13 M. Pursuant to subsection L of this section, in the event the
14 tax credits authorized by this section exceed any of the limits
15 provided in paragraphs 1 through 3 of subsection L of this section
16 in any year, the Tax Commission shall permit any excess over Ten

18 the percentage adjustment formula for subsequent years with respect
19 to any changes to the future of the credit.
20 N. The Tax Commission shall notify the Office of the State
21 Secretary of Energy and Environment at any time when the amount of
22 claims for credits allowed pursuant to this section reaches eighty
23 percent (80%) of the total annual limit provided in subsection J of
24 this section. Upon such notification, the Secretary shall provide
Req. No. 12542 Page 9

5 of the public peace, health or safety, an emergency is hereby
6 declared to exist, by reason whereof this act shall take effect and
7 be in full force from and after its passage and approval.
