7 first day of the affected taxable year a percentage by which the
8 credits authorized by this section shall be reduced so the total
9 amount of credits used to offset tax does not exceed each of the
10 limits provided in paragraphs 1 through 3 of this subsection. The
11 formula to be used for the percentage adjustment shall be Ten
