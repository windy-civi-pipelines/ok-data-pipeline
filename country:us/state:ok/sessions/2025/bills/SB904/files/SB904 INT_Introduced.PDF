(1) develop a new methodology for calculating state
8
9
Medicaid program reimbursements to nursing
9
10
facilities by implementing facility-specific
10
11
rates based on expenditures relating to direct
11
12
care staffing, and

13
(2) recommend changes to the incentive reimbursement
13

19
subparagraph.
19
20
c. The advisory committee shall be staffed and advised by
20
21
the Oklahoma Health Care Authority.

22
d. The new methodology will shall be submitted for

23
24
Authority by January 15, 2005, and shall be finalized

(2) other costs.
20
21
f. The Oklahoma Health Care Authority, in calculating the
21
22
base year prospective direct care rate component,
22
23
shall use the following criteria:
23
24

Req. No. 599 Page 20

1
(1) to construct an array of facility per diem

(2) each facility’s direct care base-year component
6
7
of the rate shall be the lesser of the facility’s

10
(3) as soon as practicable after receipt of any
10
11
necessary federal approval, and subject to
11
12
appropriation of funds for a rate increase to

11
12
the resulting increase on October 1, 2019,
12
13

13
14
existing base reimbursement rate and
14
15
distributed accordingly. The remaining
15
16
fifty percent (50%) of the increase shall be
16
