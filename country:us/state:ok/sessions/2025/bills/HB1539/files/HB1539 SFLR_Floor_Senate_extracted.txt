3 D. 1. "Qualifying cumulative revenue growth" means an increase
4 of at least Three Hundred Million Dollars ($300,000,000.00) in
5 excess of the applicable base year amount, which shall include any
6 decrease in the total collections amount for any fiscal year which
7 reflects a decline in total revenue collections. If the total
8 revenue collections equal or exceed Three Hundred Million Dollars
9 ($300,000,000.00) using either a comparison of one fiscal year to
10 the next succeeding fiscal year or equal or exceed Three Hundred
11 Million Dollars ($300,000,000.00) as a result of multiple successive
12 comparisons, which shall take into account any comparison which
13 results in an increase of less than Three Hundred Million Dollars
14 ($300,000,000.00) or which results in a decline in total collections
15 from the preceding year, then if such cumulative net total,
16 including any year in which total collections declined, equals or
17 exceeds Three Hundred Million Dollars ($300,000,000.00) then the
18 next decrease in the income tax rates as described by this

1 3. Except as otherwise provided by this subsection, for all
2 taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2026, a tax is hereby
3 imposed upon the Oklahoma taxable income of every resident or
4 nonresident individual, which tax shall be as prescribed in
5 paragraphs 1 and 2 of subsection C of this section reduced in each
6 of the rates as prescribed by paragraph 1 or paragraph 2 of
7 subsection C of this section by twenty-five hundredths of one
8 percent (0.0025), expressed as a decimal, for purposes of the
9 reduction, for any income tax year beginning on the January 1 date
10 immediately succeeding a fiscal year ending on the preceding June 30
11 for which the State Board of Equalization makes a certification, at
12 its December meeting, that total revenue collections for such fiscal
13 year exceeded the qualifying cumulative revenue growth by Three
14 Hundred Million Dollars ($300,000,000.00) or more.
15 4. The State Board of Equalization, at its December meeting
16 each year, shall make a determination regarding the possibility of a
17 decrease in the income tax rate otherwise prescribed by this
18 subsection. If the revenue conditions prescribed by this subsection
19 are met, which shall be included as part of the findings of the
20 State Board of Equalization, then the income tax rates otherwise
21 prescribed by paragraphs 1 and 2 of subsection C of this section
22 shall be reduced by twenty-five hundredths of one percent (0.0025)
23 effective on January 1 of the calendar year immediately following
24 the year during which the State Board of Equalization makes the
SENATE FLOOR VERSION - HB1539 SFLR Page 9
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)
1 find ing that qualifying cumulative revenue growth as defined by this
2 subsection is sufficient to reduce the income tax rates otherwise
3 prescribed by paragraphs 1 and 2 of subsection C of this section.
4 For purposes of this subsection, the total collections from all
5 revenue sources for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2023, shall be
6 the initial base year amount.
7 5. Beginning with the December 2025 meeting of the State Board
8 of Equalization and at each succeeding December meeting, the State
9 Board shall compare the total revenue collections amount for the
10 fiscal year ending on the immediately preceding June 30 date, to the
11 applicable base year total collections amount. If there is an
12 increase in the total collections amount equal to or greater than
13 Three Hundred Million Dollars ($300,000,000.00) compared to the
14 initial base year total collections amount, the income tax rates
15 otherwise prescribed by paragraphs 1 and 2 of subsection C of this
16 section shall be reduced effective January 1 of the immediately
17 succeeding calendar year. If there is not an increase of at least
18 Three Hundred Million Dollars ($300,000,000.00) in the total
19 collections amount as reflected in the December certification of
20 total collections compared to the applicable base year total
21 collection amount, there shall be no modification of such income tax
22 rates.
23 6. For any fiscal year with respect to which the qualifying
24 cumulative revenue growth as determined at the December meeting
SENATE FLOOR VERSION - HB1539 SFLR Page 10
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)
1 equa ls or exceeds the applicable base year total collection amount
2 by Three Hundred Million Dollars ($300,000,000.00) or more, the
3 applicable base year total collections amount shall be adjusted for
4 purposes of any succeeding comparison by adding Three Hundred
5 Million Dollars ($300,000,000.00) plus the increment of all revenues
6 exceeding Three Hundred Million Dollars ($300,000,000.00) to the
7 prior base year amount and the resulting sum shall become the
8 adjusted base year amount for purposes of future computations
9 required by this subsection.
10 7. After an adjustment is made to any base year amount, a
11 reduction in the income tax rate otherwise prescribed pursuant to
12 this subsection, in increments of twenty-five hundredths of one
13 percent (0.0025), may only occur if there is a subsequent increase
14 of Three Hundred Million Dollars ($300,000,000.00) or more in the
15 qualifying cumulative revenue growth as defined by this subsection.
16 Subject to the determinations regarding the increase in total
17 collections as defined by this subsection, the reductions prescribed
18 by this subsection shall be made for all applicable income tax years
19 until the rates of individual income tax as prescribed by paragraphs
20 1 and 2 of subsection C of this section equals zero (0).
21 8. For purposes of reporting total collections for purposes of
22 this subsection, the Oklahoma Tax Commission shall use the same

1 No deduction for federal income taxes paid shall be allowed to

3 D. 1. "Qualifying cumulative revenue growth" means an increase
4 of at least Three Hundred Million Dollars ($300,000,000.00) in
5 excess of the applicable base year amount, which shall include any
6 decrease in the total collections amount for any fiscal year which
7 reflects a decline in total revenue collections. If the total
8 revenue collections equal or exceed Three Hundred Million Dollars
9 ($300,000,000.00) using either a comparison of one fiscal year to
10 the next succeeding fiscal year or equal or exceed Three Hundred
11 Million Dollars ($300,000,000.00) as a result of multiple successive
12 comparisons, which shall take into account any comparison which
13 results in an increase of less than Three Hundred Million Dollars
14 ($300,000,000.00) or which results in a decline in total collections
15 from the preceding year, then if such cumulative net total,
16 including any year in which total collections declined, equals or
17 exceeds Three Hundred Million Dollars ($300,000,000.00) then the
18 next decrease in the income tax rates as described by this
19 subsection shall be implemented.

1 3. Except as otherwise provided by this subsection, for all
2 taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2026, a tax is hereby
3 imposed upon the Oklahoma taxable income of every resident or
4 nonresident individual, which tax shall be as prescribed in
5 paragraphs 1 and 2 of subsection C of this section reduced in each
6 of the rates as prescribed by paragraph 1 or paragraph 2 of
7 subsection C of this section by twenty-five hundredths of one
8 percent (0.0025), expressed as a decimal, for purposes of the
9 reduction, for any income tax year beginning on the January 1 date
10 immediately succeeding a fiscal year ending on the preceding June 30
11 for which the State Board of Equalization makes a certification, at
12 its December meeting, that total revenue collections for such fiscal
13 year exceeded the qualifying cumulative revenue growth by Three
14 Hundred Million Dollars ($300,000,000.00) or more.
15 4. The State Board of Equalization, at its December meeting
16 each year, shall make a determination regarding the possibility of a
17 decrease in the income tax rate otherwise prescribed by this
18 subsection. If the revenue conditions prescribed by this subsection
19 are met, which shall be included as part of the findings of the
20 State Board of Equalization, then the income tax rates otherwise
21 prescribed by paragraphs 1 and 2 of subsection C of this section
22 shall be reduced by twenty-five hundredths of one percent (0.0025)
23 effective on January 1 of the calendar year immediately following
24 the year during which the State Board of Equalization makes the
SENATE FLOOR VERSION - HB1539 SFLR Page 9
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)

1 find ing that qualifying cumulative revenue growth as defined by this
2 subsection is sufficient to reduce the income tax rates otherwise
3 prescribed by paragraphs 1 and 2 of subsection C of this section.
4 For purposes of this subsection, the total collections from all
5 revenue sources for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2023, shall be
6 the initial base year amount.
7 5. Beginning with the December 2025 meeting of the State Board
8 of Equalization and at each succeeding December meeting, the State
9 Board shall compare the total revenue collections amount for the
10 fiscal year ending on the immediately preceding June 30 date, to the
11 applicable base year total collections amount. If there is an
12 increase in the total collections amount equal to or greater than
13 Three Hundred Million Dollars ($300,000,000.00) compared to the
14 initial base year total collections amount, the income tax rates
15 otherwise prescribed by paragraphs 1 and 2 of subsection C of this
16 section shall be reduced effective January 1 of the immediately
17 succeeding calendar year. If there is not an increase of at least
18 Three Hundred Million Dollars ($300,000,000.00) in the total
19 collections amount as reflected in the December certification of
20 total collections compared to the applicable base year total
21 collection amount, there shall be no modification of such income tax
22 rates.
23 6. For any fiscal year with respect to which the qualifying
24 cumulative revenue growth as determined at the December meeting
SENATE FLOOR VERSION - HB1539 SFLR Page 10
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)

1 equa ls or exceeds the applicable base year total collection amount
2 by Three Hundred Million Dollars ($300,000,000.00) or more, the
3 applicable base year total collections amount shall be adjusted for
4 purposes of any succeeding comparison by adding Three Hundred
5 Million Dollars ($300,000,000.00) plus the increment of all revenues
6 exceeding Three Hundred Million Dollars ($300,000,000.00) to the
7 prior base year amount and the resulting sum shall become the
8 adjusted base year amount for purposes of future computations
9 required by this subsection.
10 7. After an adjustment is made to any base year amount, a
11 reduction in the income tax rate otherwise prescribed pursuant to
12 this subsection, in increments of twenty-five hundredths of one
13 percent (0.0025), may only occur if there is a subsequent increase
14 of Three Hundred Million Dollars ($300,000,000.00) or more in the
15 qualifying cumulative revenue growth as defined by this subsection.
16 Subject to the determinations regarding the increase in total
17 collections as defined by this subsection, the reductions prescribed
18 by this subsection shall be made for all applicable income tax years
19 until the rates of individual income tax as prescribed by paragraphs
20 1 and 2 of subsection C of this section equals zero (0).
21 8. For purposes of reporting total collections for purposes of
22 this subsection, the Oklahoma Tax Commission shall use the same
