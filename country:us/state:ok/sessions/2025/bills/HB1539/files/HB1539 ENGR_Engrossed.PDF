22 D. 1. "Qualifying cumulative revenue growth" means an increase

24 excess of the applicable base year amount, which shall include any
ENGR. H. B. NO. 1539 Page 7

1 decr ease in the total collections amount for any fiscal year which
2 reflects a decline in total revenue collections. If the total
3 revenue collections equal or exceed Three Hundred Million Dollars
4 ($300,000,000.00) using either a comparison of one fiscal year to
5 the next succeeding fiscal year or equal or exceed Three Hundred
6 Million Dollars ($300,000,000.00) as a result of multiple successive
7 comparisons, which shall take into account any comparison which
8 results in an increase of less than Three Hundred Million Dollars
9 ($300,000,000.00) or which results in a decline in total collections
10 from the preceding year, then if such cumulative net total,
11 including any year in which total collections declined, equals or
12 exceeds Three Hundred Million Dollars ($300,000,000.00) then the
13 next decrease in the income tax rates as described by this
14 subsection shall be implemented.
15 2. "Total revenue collections" includes all revenue sources
16 reported in the annual report of the Oklahoma Tax Commission
17 excluding any tax collected by the Commission from levies imposed by
18 counties, cities, towns or any other entity of local government.
19 3. Except as otherwise provided by this subsection, for all
20 taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2026, a tax is hereby
21 imposed upon the Oklahoma taxable income of every resident or
22 nonresident individual, which tax shall be as prescribed in
23 paragraphs 1 and 2 of subsection C of this section reduced in each
24 of the rates as prescribed by paragraph 1 or paragraph 2 of
ENGR. H. B. NO. 1539 Page 8

1 subs ection C of this section by twenty-five hundredths of one
2 percent (0.0025), expressed as a decimal, for purposes of the
3 reduction, for any income tax year beginning on the January 1 date
4 immediately succeeding a fiscal year ending on the preceding June 30
5 for which the State Board of Equalization makes a certification, at
6 its December meeting, that total revenue collections for such fiscal
7 year exceeded the qualifying cumulative revenue growth by Three
8 Hundred Million Dollars ($300,000,000.00) or more.
9 4. The State Board of Equalization, at its December meeting
10 each year, shall make a determination regarding the possibility of a
11 decrease in the income tax rate otherwise prescribed by this
12 subsection. If the revenue conditions prescribed by this subsection
13 are met, which shall be included as part of the findings of the
14 State Board of Equalization, then the income tax rates otherwise
15 prescribed by paragraphs 1 and 2 of subsection C of this section
16 shall be reduced by twenty-five hundredths of one percent (0.0025)
17 effective on January 1 of the calendar year immediately following
18 the year during which the State Board of Equalization makes the
19 finding that qualifying cumulative revenue growth as defined by this
20 subsection is sufficient to reduce the income tax rates otherwise
21 prescribed by paragraphs 1 and 2 of subsection C of this section.
22 For purposes of this subsection, the total collections from all
23 revenue sources for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2023, shall be
24 the initial base year amount.
ENGR. H. B. NO. 1539 Page 9

1 5. Beginning with the December 2025 meeting of the State Board
2 of Equalization and at each succeeding December meeting, the State
3 Board shall compare the total revenue collections amount for the
4 fiscal year ending on the immediately preceding June 30 date, to the
5 applicable base year total collections amount. If there is an
6 increase in the total collections amount equal to or greater than
7 Three Hundred Million Dollars ($300,000,000.00) compared to the
8 initial base year total collections amount, the income tax rates
9 otherwise prescribed by paragraphs 1 and 2 of subsection C of this
10 section shall be reduced effective January 1 of the immediately
11 succeeding calendar year. If there is not an increase of at least
12 Three Hundred Million Dollars ($300,000,000.00) in the total
13 collections amount as reflected in the December certification of
14 total collections compared to the applicable base year total
15 collection amount, there shall be no modification of such income tax
16 rates.
17 6. For any fiscal year with respect to which the qualifying
18 cumulative revenue growth as determined at the December meeting
19 equals or exceeds the applicable base year total collection amount
20 by Three Hundred Million Dollars ($300,000,000.00) or more, the
21 applicable base year total collections amount shall be adjusted for
22 purposes of any succeeding comparison by adding Three Hundred
23 Million Dollars ($300,000,000.00) plus the increment of all revenues
24 exceeding Three Hundred Million Dollars ($300,000,000.00) to the
ENGR. H. B. NO. 1539 Page 10

1 prio r base year amount and the resulting sum shall become the
2 adjusted base year amount for purposes of future computations
3 required by this subsection.
4 7. After an adjustment is made to any base year amount, a
5 reduction in the income tax rate otherwise prescribed pursuant to
6 this subsection, in increments of twenty-five hundredths of one
7 percent (0.0025), may only occur if there is a subsequent increase
8 of Three Hundred Million Dollars ($300,000,000.00) or more in the
9 qualifying cumulative revenue growth as defined by this subsection.
10 Subject to the determinations regarding the increase in total
11 collections as defined by this subsection, the reductions prescribed
12 by this subsection shall be made for all applicable income tax years
13 until the rates of individual income tax as prescribed by paragraphs
14 1 and 2 of subsection C of this section equals zero (0).
15 8. For purposes of reporting total collections for purposes of
16 this subsection, the Oklahoma Tax Commission shall use the same
17 methodology used to report estimated revenues to the State Board of
18 Equalization that was used to make the report for the December 2024
19 meeting.
20 E. Nonresident aliens. In lieu of the rates set forth in
21 subsection A above this section, there shall be imposed on
