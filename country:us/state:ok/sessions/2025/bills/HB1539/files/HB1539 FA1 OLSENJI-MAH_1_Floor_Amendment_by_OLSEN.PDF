7 ($425,000,000.00) in excess of the applicable base year amount,
8 which shall include any decrease in the total collections amount for
9 any fiscal year which reflects a decline in total revenue
10 collections. If the total revenue collections equal or exceed Four
11 Hundred Twenty-five Million Dollars ($425,000,000.00) using either a
12 comparison of one fiscal year to the next succeeding fiscal year or
13 equal or exceed Four Hundred Twenty-five Million Dollars
14 ($425,000,000.00) as a result of multiple successive comparisons,
15 which shall take into account any comparison which results in an
16 increase of less than Four Hundred Twenty-five Million Dollars
17 ($425,000,000.00) or which results in a decline in total collections
18 from the preceding year, then if such cumulative net total,
19 including any year in which total collections declined, equals or
20 exceeds Four Hundred Twenty-five Million Dollars ($425,000,000.00)
21 then the next decrease in the income tax rates as described by this
22 subsection shall be implemented.
23 2. "Total revenue collections" includes all revenue sources
24 reported in the annual report of the Oklahoma Tax Commission
Req. No. 13310 Page 8

1 excl uding any tax collected by the Commission from levies imposed by
2 counties, cities, towns or any other entity of local government.
3 3. Except as otherwise provided by this subsection, for all
4 taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2026, a tax is hereby
5 imposed upon the Oklahoma taxable income of every resident or
6 nonresident individual, which tax shall be as prescribed in
7 paragraphs 1 and 2 of subsection C of this section reduced in each
8 of the rates as prescribed by paragraph 1 or paragraph 2 of
9 subsection C of this section by one percent (0.01), expressed as a
10 decimal, for purposes of the reduction, for any income tax year
11 beginning on the January 1 date immediately succeeding a fiscal year
12 ending on the preceding June 30 for which the State Board of
13 Equalization makes a certification, at its December meeting, that
14 total revenue collections for such fiscal year exceeded the
15 qualifying cumulative revenue growth by Four Hundred Twenty-five
16 Million Dollars ($425,000,000.00) or more.
17 4. The State Board of Equalization, at its December meeting
18 each year, shall make a determination regarding the possibility of a
19 decrease in the income tax rate otherwise prescribed by this
20 subsection. If the revenue conditions prescribed by this subsection
21 are met, which shall be included as part of the findings of the
22 State Board of Equalization, then the income tax rates otherwise
23 prescribed by paragraphs 1 and 2 of subsection C of this section
24 shall be reduced by one percent (0.01) effective on January 1 of the
Req. No. 13310 Page 9

1 cale ndar year immediately following the year during which the State
2 Board of Equalization makes the finding that qualifying cumulative
3 revenue growth as defined by this subsection is sufficient to reduce
4 the income tax rates otherwise prescribed by paragraphs 1 and 2 of
5 subsection C of this section. For purposes of this subsection, the
6 total collections from all revenue sources for the fiscal year
7 ending June 30, 2023, shall be the initial base year amount.
8 5. Beginning with the December 2025 meeting of the State Board
9 of Equalization and at each succeeding December meeting, the State
10 Board shall compare the total revenue collections amount for the
11 fiscal year ending on the immediately preceding June 30 date, to the
12 applicable base year total collections amount. If there is an
13 increase in the total collections amount equal to or greater than
14 Four Hundred Twenty-five Million Dollars ($425,000,000.00) compared
15 to the initial base year total collections amount, the income tax
16 rates otherwise prescribed by paragraphs 1 and 2 of subsection C of
17 this section shall be reduced effective January 1 of the immediately
18 succeeding calendar year. If there is not an increase of at least
19 Four Hundred Twenty-five Million Dollars ($425,000,000.00) in the
20 total collections amount as reflected in the December certification
21 of total collections compared to the applicable base year total
22 collection amount, there shall be no modification of such income tax
23 rates.
24
Req. No. 13310 Page 10

1 6. For any fiscal year with respect to which the qualifying
2 cumulative revenue growth as determined at the December meeting
3 equals or exceeds the applicable base year total collection amount
4 by Four Hundred Twenty-five Million Dollars ($425,000,000.00) or
5 more, the applicable base year total collections amount shall be
6 adjusted for purposes of any succeeding comparison by adding Four
7 Hundred Twenty-five Million Dollars ($425,000,000.00) plus the
8 increment of all revenues exceeding Four Hundred Twenty-five Million
9 Dollars ($425,000,000.00) to the prior base year amount and the
10 resulting sum shall become the adjusted base year amount for
11 purposes of future computations required by this subsection.
12 7. After an adjustment is made to any base year amount, a
13 reduction in the income tax rate otherwise prescribed pursuant to
14 this subsection, in increments of one percent (0.01), may only occur
15 if there is a subsequent increase of Four Hundred Twenty-five
16 Million Dollars ($425,000,000.00) or more in the qualifying
17 cumulative revenue growth as defined by this subsection. Subject to
18 the determinations regarding the increase in total collections as
19 defined by this subsection, the reductions prescribed by this
20 subsection shall be made for all applicable income tax years until
21 the rates of individual income tax as prescribed by paragraphs 1 and
22 2 of subsection C of this section equals zero (0).
23 8. For purposes of reporting total collections for purposes of
24 this subsection, the Oklahoma Tax Commission shall use the same
