3 excess of the applicable base year amount, which shall include any
4 decrease in the total collections amount for any fiscal year which
5 reflects a decline in total revenue collections. If the total

8 the next succeeding fiscal year or equal or exceed Three Hundred
9 Million Dollars ($300,000,000.00) as a result of multiple successive
10 comparisons, which shall take into account any comparison which
11 results in an increase of less than Three Hundred Million Dollars
12 ($300,000,000.00) or which results in a decline in total collections
13 from the preceding year, then if such cumulative net total,
14 including any year in which total collections declined, equals or
15 exceeds Three Hundred Million Dollars ($300,000,000.00) then the
16 next decrease in the income tax rates as described by this
17 subsection shall be implemented.
18 2. "Total revenue collections" includes all revenue sources
19 reported in the annual report of the Oklahoma Tax Commission
20 excluding any tax collected by the Commission from levies imposed by
21 counties, cities, towns or any other entity of local government.

23 taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2026, a tax is hereby

5 percent (0.0025), expressed as a decimal, for purposes of the

7 immediately succeeding a fiscal year ending on the preceding June 30

9 its December meeting, that total revenue collections for such fiscal
10 year exceeded the qualifying cumulative revenue growth by Three
11 Hundred Million Dollars ($300,000,000.00) or more.
12 4. The State Board of Equalization, at its December meeting
13 each year, shall make a determination regarding the possibility of a
14 decrease in the income tax rate otherwise prescribed by this
15 subsection. If the revenue conditions prescribed by this subsection
16 are met, which shall be included as part of the findings of the
17 State Board of Equalization, then the income tax rates otherwise
18 prescribed by paragraphs 1 and 2 of subsection C of this section
19 shall be reduced by twenty-five hundredths of one percent (0.0025)
20 effective on January 1 of the calendar year immediately following
21 the year during which the State Board of Equalization makes the
22 finding that qualifying cumulative revenue growth as defined by this
23 subsection is sufficient to reduce the income tax rates otherwise
24 prescribed by paragraphs 1 and 2 of subsection C of this section.
Req. No. 12218 Page 9
1 For purposes of this subsection, the total collections from all
2 revenue sources for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2023, shall be
3 the initial base year amount.
4 5. Beginning with the December 2025 meeting of the State Board
5 of Equalization and at each succeeding December meeting, the State
6 Board shall compare the total revenue collections amount for the
7 fiscal year ending on the immediately preceding June 30 date, to the
8 applicable base year total collections amount. If there is an
9 increase in the total collections amount equal to or greater than
10 Three Hundred Million Dollars ($300,000,000.00) compared to the
11 initial base year total collections amount, the income tax rates
12 otherwise prescribed by paragraphs 1 and 2 of subsection C of this
13 section shall be reduced effective January 1 of the immediately
14 succeeding calendar year. If there is not an increase of at least
15 Three Hundred Million Dollars ($300,000,000.00) in the total
16 collections amount as reflected in the December certification of
17 total collections compared to the applicable base year total
18 collection amount, there shall be no modification of such income tax
19 rates.
20 6. For any fiscal year with respect to which the qualifying
21 cumulative revenue growth as determined at the December meeting
22 equals or exceeds the applicable base year total collection amount
23 by Three Hundred Million Dollars ($300,000,000.00) or more, the
24 applicable base year total collections amount shall be adjusted for
Req. No. 12218 Page 10
1 purp oses of any succeeding comparison by adding Three Hundred
2 Million Dollars ($300,000,000.00) plus the increment of all revenues
3 exceeding Three Hundred Million Dollars ($300,000,000.00) to the
4 prior base year amount and the resulting sum shall become the
5 adjusted base year amount for purposes of future computations
6 required by this subsection.
7 7. After an adjustment is made to any base year amount, a
8 reduction in the income tax rate otherwise prescribed pursuant to
9 this subsection, in increments of twenty-five hundredths of one
10 percent (0.0025), may only occur if there is a subsequent increase
11 of Three Hundred Million Dollars ($300,000,000.00) or more in the
12 qualifying cumulative revenue growth as defined by this subsection.
13 Subject to the determinations regarding the increase in total
14 collections as defined by this subsection, the reductions prescribed
15 by this subsection shall be made for all applicable income tax years
16 until the rates of individual income tax as prescribed by paragraphs
17 1 and 2 of subsection C of this section equals zero (0).

19 this subsection, the Oklahoma Tax Commission shall use the same

2 of at least Three Hundred Million Dollars ($300,000,000.00) in
3 excess of the applicable base year amount, which shall include any
4 decrease in the total collections amount for any fiscal year which
5 reflects a decline in total revenue collections. If the total
6 revenue collections equal or exceed Three Hundred Million Dollars
7 ($300,000,000.00) using either a comparison of one fiscal year to
8 the next succeeding fiscal year or equal or exceed Three Hundred
9 Million Dollars ($300,000,000.00) as a result of multiple successive
10 comparisons, which shall take into account any comparison which
11 results in an increase of less than Three Hundred Million Dollars
12 ($300,000,000.00) or which results in a decline in total collections
13 from the preceding year, then if such cumulative net total,
14 including any year in which total collections declined, equals or
15 exceeds Three Hundred Million Dollars ($300,000,000.00) then the
16 next decrease in the income tax rates as described by this
17 subsection shall be implemented.
18 2. "Total revenue collections" includes all revenue sources
19 reported in the annual report of the Oklahoma Tax Commission
20 excluding any tax collected by the Commission from levies imposed by

23 taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2026, a tax is hereby

3 of the rates as prescribed by paragraph 1 or paragraph 2 of
4 subsection C of this section by twenty-five hundredths of one
5 percent (0.0025), expressed as a decimal, for purposes of the
6 reduction, for any income tax year beginning on the January 1 date
7 immediately succeeding a fiscal year ending on the preceding June 30
8 for which the State Board of Equalization makes a certification, at
9 its December meeting, that total revenue collections for such fiscal
10 year exceeded the qualifying cumulative revenue growth by Three
11 Hundred Million Dollars ($300,000,000.00) or more.
12 4. The State Board of Equalization, at its December meeting
13 each year, shall make a determination regarding the possibility of a
14 decrease in the income tax rate otherwise prescribed by this
15 subsection. If the revenue conditions prescribed by this subsection
16 are met, which shall be included as part of the findings of the
17 State Board of Equalization, then the income tax rates otherwise
18 prescribed by paragraphs 1 and 2 of subsection C of this section
19 shall be reduced by twenty-five hundredths of one percent (0.0025)
20 effective on January 1 of the calendar year immediately following
21 the year during which the State Board of Equalization makes the
22 finding that qualifying cumulative revenue growth as defined by this
23 subsection is sufficient to reduce the income tax rates otherwise
24 prescribed by paragraphs 1 and 2 of subsection C of this section.
Req. No. 12218 Page 9

1 For purposes of this subsection, the total collections from all
2 revenue sources for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2023, shall be
3 the initial base year amount.
4 5. Beginning with the December 2025 meeting of the State Board
5 of Equalization and at each succeeding December meeting, the State
6 Board shall compare the total revenue collections amount for the
7 fiscal year ending on the immediately preceding June 30 date, to the
8 applicable base year total collections amount. If there is an
9 increase in the total collections amount equal to or greater than
10 Three Hundred Million Dollars ($300,000,000.00) compared to the
11 initial base year total collections amount, the income tax rates
12 otherwise prescribed by paragraphs 1 and 2 of subsection C of this
13 section shall be reduced effective January 1 of the immediately
14 succeeding calendar year. If there is not an increase of at least
15 Three Hundred Million Dollars ($300,000,000.00) in the total
16 collections amount as reflected in the December certification of
17 total collections compared to the applicable base year total
18 collection amount, there shall be no modification of such income tax
19 rates.
20 6. For any fiscal year with respect to which the qualifying
21 cumulative revenue growth as determined at the December meeting
22 equals or exceeds the applicable base year total collection amount
23 by Three Hundred Million Dollars ($300,000,000.00) or more, the
24 applicable base year total collections amount shall be adjusted for
Req. No. 12218 Page 10

1 purp oses of any succeeding comparison by adding Three Hundred
2 Million Dollars ($300,000,000.00) plus the increment of all revenues
3 exceeding Three Hundred Million Dollars ($300,000,000.00) to the
4 prior base year amount and the resulting sum shall become the
5 adjusted base year amount for purposes of future computations
6 required by this subsection.
7 7. After an adjustment is made to any base year amount, a
8 reduction in the income tax rate otherwise prescribed pursuant to
9 this subsection, in increments of twenty-five hundredths of one
10 percent (0.0025), may only occur if there is a subsequent increase
11 of Three Hundred Million Dollars ($300,000,000.00) or more in the
12 qualifying cumulative revenue growth as defined by this subsection.
13 Subject to the determinations regarding the increase in total
14 collections as defined by this subsection, the reductions prescribed
15 by this subsection shall be made for all applicable income tax years
16 until the rates of individual income tax as prescribed by paragraphs
17 1 and 2 of subsection C of this section equals zero (0).
