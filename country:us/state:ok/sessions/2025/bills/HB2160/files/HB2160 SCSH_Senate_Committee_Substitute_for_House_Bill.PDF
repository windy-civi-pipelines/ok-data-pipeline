13 D. The licenses issued to each new motor vehicle dealer, new
14 powersports vehicle dealer, manufacturer, distributor, factory
15 branch, or distributor branch shall specify the location of the
16 factory, office, or branch thereof. In case such location is
17 changed, the Commission may endorse the change of location on the
18 license without charge unless the change of address triggers a
19 relocation of a new motor vehicle dealer or new powersports vehicle
20 dealer pursuant to the provisions of Section 578.1 of this title.
21 The licenses of each new vehicle dealer shall be posted in a
22 conspicuous place in the dealer’s licensee’s place or places of

Req. No. 2061 Page 28
1 with the dealer’s delivery and preparation obligations
2 according to the agreements on file with the
3 Commission which must be found by the Commission to be
4 reasonable, or has failed to adequately and fairly
5 compensate its dealers for labor, parts, and other
6 expenses incurred by the dealer to perform under and
7 comply with manufacturer’s warranty agreements and
8 recall repairs which shall include diagnostic work as
9 applicable and assistance requested by a consumer
10 whose vehicle was subjected to an over-the-air or
11 remote change, repair, or update to any part, system,
12 accessory, or function by the manufacturer and
13 performed by the dealer in order to satisfy the
14 consumer. Time allowances for the diagnosis and
15 performance of repair work shall be reasonable and
16 adequate for the work to be performed. Adequate and
17 fair compensation, which under this provision shall be
18 no less than the rates customarily charged for retail
19 consumer repairs as calculated herein, for parts and
20 labor for warranty and recall repairs shall, at the
21 option of the new motor vehicle dealer, be established
22 by the new motor vehicle dealer submitting to the
23 manufacturer or distributor one hundred sequential
24 nonwarranty consumer-paid service repair orders which
Req. No. 2061 Page 29
1 contain warranty-like repairs, or ninety (90)
2 consecutive days of nonwarranty consumer-paid service
3 repair orders which contain warranty-like repairs,
4 whichever is less, covering repairs made no more than
5 one hundred eighty (180) days before the submission
6 and declaring the average percentage labor rate and/or
7 markup rate. A motor vehicle dealer may not submit a
8 request to establish its retail rates more than once
9 in a twelve-month period. That request may establish
10 a parts markup rate, labor rate, or both. The new
11 motor vehicle dealer or new powersports vehicle dealer
12 shall calculate its retail parts rate by determining
13 the total charges for parts from the qualified repair
14 orders submitted, dividing that amount by the new
15 motor vehicle dealer’s total cost of the purchase of
16 those parts, subtracting one (1), and multiplying by
17 one hundred (100) to produce a percentage. The new
18 motor vehicle dealer or new powersports vehicle dealer
19 shall calculate its retail labor rate by dividing the
20 amount of the new vehicle dealer’s total labor sales
21 from the qualified repair orders by the total labor
22 hours charged for those sales. When submitting repair
23 orders to establish a retail parts and labor rate, a
24
Req. No. 2061 Page 30
1 new motor vehicle dealer or new powersports vehicle
2 dealer need not include repairs for:
3 (1) routine maintenance including but not limited to
4 the replacement of bulbs, fluids, filters,
5 batteries, and belts that are not provided in the
6 course of and related to a repair,
7 (2) factory special events, specials, or promotional
8 discounts for retail consumer repairs,
9 (3) parts sold or repairs performed at wholesale,
10 (4) factory-approved goodwill or policy repairs or
11 replacements,
12 (5) repairs with aftermarket parts, when calculating
13 the retail parts rate but not the retail labor
14 rate,
15 (6) repairs on aftermarket parts,
16 (7) replacement of or work on tires including front-
17 end alignments and wheel or tire rotations,
18 (8) repairs of vehicles owned by the new motor
19 vehicle dealer or new powersports vehicle dealer
20 or employee thereof at the time of the repair,
21 (9) vehicle reconditioning, or
22 (10) items that do not have individual part numbers
23 including, but not limited to, nuts, bolts, and
24 fasteners.
Req. No. 2061 Page 31
1 A manufacturer or distributor may, not later than
2 forty-five (45) days after submission, rebut that
3 declared retail parts and labor rate in writing by
4 reasonably substantiating that the rate is not
5 accurate or is incomplete pursuant to the provisions
6 of this section. If the manufacturer or distributor
7 determines the set of repair orders submitted by the
8 new motor vehicle dealer or new powersports vehicle
9 dealer pursuant to this section for a retail labor
10 rate or retail parts markup rate is substantially
11 higher than the new vehicle dealer’s current warranty
12 rates, the manufacturer or distributor may request, in
13 writing, within forty-five (45) days after the
14 manufacturer’s or distributor’s receipt of the new
15 vehicle dealer’s initial submission, all repair orders
16 closed within the period of thirty (30) days
17 immediately preceding, or thirty (30) days immediately
18 following, the set of repair orders initially
19 submitted by the new motor vehicle dealer. All time
20 periods under this section shall be suspended until
21 the supplemental repair orders are provided. If the
22 manufacturer or distributor requests supplemental
23 repair orders, the manufacturer or distributor may,
24 within thirty (30) days after receiving the
Req. No. 2061 Page 32
1 supplemental repair orders and in accordance with the
2 formula described in this subsection, calculate a
3 proposed adjusted retail labor rate or retail parts
4 markup rate, as applicable, based upon any set of the
5 qualified repair orders submitted by the franchisee
6 and following the formula set forth herein to
7 establish the rate. The retail labor and parts rates
8 shall go into effect thirty (30) days following the
9 approval by the manufacturer or distributor. If the
10 declared rate is rebutted, the manufacturer or
11 distributor shall provide written notice stating the
12 reasons for the rebuttal, an explanation of the
13 reasons for the rebuttal, and a copy of all
14 calculations used by the franchisor in determining the
15 manufacturer or distributor’s position and propose an
16 adjustment in writing of the average percentage markup
17 or labor rate based on that rebuttal not later than
18 forty-five (45) days after submission. If the new
19 motor vehicle dealer or new powersports vehicle dealer
20 does not agree with the proposed average percentage
21 markup or labor rate, the new vehicle dealer may file
22 a protest with the Commission not later than thirty
23 (30) days after receipt of that proposal by the
24 manufacturer or distributor. In the event a protest
Req. No. 2061 Page 33
1 is filed, the manufacturer or distributor shall have
2 the burden of proof to establish the new vehicle
3 dealer’s submitted parts markup rate or labor rate was
4 inaccurate or not complete pursuant to the provisions
5 of this section. A manufacturer or distributor may
6 not retaliate against any new motor vehicle dealer or
7 new powersports vehicle dealer seeking to exercise its
8 rights under this section. A manufacturer or
9 distributor may require a dealer to submit repair
10 orders in accordance with this section in order to
11 validate the reasonableness of a dealer’s retail rate
12 for parts or labor not more often than once every
13 twelve (12) months. A manufacturer or distributor may
14 not otherwise recover its costs from new vehicle
15 dealers within this state including a surcharge
16 imposed on a new motor vehicle dealer solely intended
17 to recover the cost of reimbursing a dealer for parts
18 and labor pursuant to this section; provided, a
19 manufacturer or distributor shall not be prohibited
20 from increasing prices for vehicles or parts in the
21 normal course of business or from auditing and
22 charging back claims in accordance with this section.
23 All claims made by dealers for compensation for
24 delivery, preparation, warranty, or recall repair work
Req. No. 2061 Page 34
1 shall be paid within thirty (30) days after approval
2 and shall be approved or disapproved within thirty
3 (30) days after receipt. When any claim is
4 disapproved, the dealer shall be notified in writing
5 of the grounds for disapproval. The dealer’s
6 delivery, preparation, and warranty obligations as
7 filed with the Commission shall constitute the
8 dealer’s sole responsibility for product liability as
9 between the dealer and manufacturer. A factory may
10 reasonably and periodically audit a new motor vehicle
11 dealer or new powersports vehicle dealer to determine
12 the validity of paid claims for dealer compensation or
13 any charge-backs for warranty parts or service
14 compensation. Except in cases of suspected fraud,
15 audits of warranty payments shall only be for the one-
16 year period immediately following the date of the
17 payment. A manufacturer shall reserve the right to
18 reasonable, periodic audits to determine the validity
19 of paid claims for dealer compensation or any charge-
20 backs for consumer or dealer incentives. Except in
21 cases of suspected fraud, audits of incentive payments
22 shall only be for a one-year period immediately
23 following the date of the payment. A factory shall
24 not deny a claim or charge a new motor vehicle dealer
Req. No. 2061 Page 35
1 back subsequent to the payment of the claim unless the
2 factory can show that the claim was false or
3 fraudulent or that the new motor vehicle dealer or new
4 powersports vehicle dealer failed to reasonably
5 substantiate the claim by the written reasonable
6 procedures of the factory. A factory shall not deny a
7 claim or implement a charge-back against a new vehicle
8 dealer after payment of a claim in the event a
9 purchaser of a new vehicle that is the subject of a
10 claim fails to comply with titling or registration
11 laws of this state and is not prevented from
12 compliance by any action of the dealer; provided, that
13 the factory may require the dealer to provide, within
14 thirty (30) days of notice of charge-back, withholding
15 of payment, or denial of claim, the documentation to
16 demonstrate the vehicle sale, delivery, and customer
17 qualification for an incentive as reported, including
18 consumer name and address and written attestation
19 signed by the dealer operator or general manager
20 stating the consumer was not on the export control
21 list and the dealer did not know or have reason to
22 know the vehicle was being exported or resold.
23 The factory shall provide written notice to a dealer
24 of a proposed charge-back that is the result of an
Req. No. 2061 Page 36
1 audit along with the specific audit results and
2 proposed charge-back amount. A dealer that receives
3 notice of a proposed charge-back pursuant to a
4 factory’s audit has the right to file a protest with
5 the Commission within thirty (30) days after receipt
6 of the notice of the charge-back or audit results,
7 whichever is later. The factory is prohibited from
8 implementing the charge-back or debiting the dealer’s
9 account until either the time frame for filing a
10 protest has passed or a final adjudication is rendered
11 by the Commission, whichever is later, unless the
12 dealer has agreed to the charge-back or charge-backs,
13 c. fails to compensate the new motor vehicle dealer for a
14 used motor vehicle:
15 (1) that is of the same make and model manufactured,
16 imported, or distributed by the factory and is a
17 line-make that the new motor vehicle dealer is
18 franchised to sell or on which the new motor
19 vehicle dealer is authorized to perform recall
20 repairs,
21 (2) that is subject to a stop-sale or do-not-drive
22 order issued by the factory or an authorized
23 governmental agency,
24
Req. No. 2061 Page 37
1 (3) that is held by the new motor vehicle dealer in
2 the dealer’s inventory at the time the stop-sale
3 or do-not-drive order is issued or that is taken
4 by the new motor vehicle dealer into the dealer’s
5 inventory after the recall notice as a result of
6 a retail consumer trade-in or a lease return to
7 the dealer inventory in accordance with an
8 applicable lease contract,
9 (4) that cannot be repaired due to the
10 unavailability, within thirty (30) days after
11 issuance of the stop-sale or do-not-drive order,
12 of a remedy or parts necessary for the new motor
13 vehicle dealer to make the recall repair, and
14 (5) that is not at least in the prorated amount of
15 one percent (1.00%) of the value of the vehicle
16 per month beginning on the date that is thirty
17 (30) days after the date on which the stop-sale
18 order was provided to the new motor vehicle
19 dealer until the earlier of either of the
20 following:
21 (a) the date the recall remedy or parts are made
22 available, or
23
24
Req. No. 2061 Page 38
1 (b) the date the new motor vehicle dealer sells,
2 trades, or otherwise disposes of the
3 affected used motor vehicle.
4 For the purposes of division (5) of this subparagraph,
5 the value of a used vehicle shall be the average Black
6 Book value for the year, make, and model of the
7 recalled vehicle. A factory may direct the manner and
8 method in which a new motor vehicle dealer must
9 demonstrate the inventory status of an affected used
10 motor vehicle to determine eligibility under this
11 subparagraph; provided, that the manner and method may
12 not be unduly burdensome and may not require
13 information that is unduly burdensome to provide. All
14 reimbursement claims made by new motor vehicle dealers
15 pursuant to this section for recall remedies or
16 repairs, or for compensation where no part or repair
17 is reasonably available and the vehicle is subject to
18 a stop-sale or do-not-drive order, shall be subject to
19 the same limitations and requirements as a warranty
20 reimbursement claim made under subparagraph b of this
21 paragraph. In the alternative, a manufacturer may
22 compensate its franchised new motor vehicle dealers
23 under a national recall compensation program;
24 provided, the compensation under the program is equal
Req. No. 2061 Page 39
1 to or greater than that provided under division (5) of
2 this subparagraph, or as the manufacturer and new
3 motor vehicle dealer otherwise agree. Nothing in this
4 section shall require a factory to provide total
5 compensation to a new motor vehicle dealer which would
6 exceed the total average Black Book value of the
7 affected used motor vehicle as originally determined
8 under division (5) of this subparagraph. Any remedy
9 provided to a new motor vehicle dealer under this
10 subparagraph is exclusive and may not be combined with
11 any other state or federal compensation remedy,
12 d. unreasonably fails or refuses to offer to its same
13 line-make franchised dealers a reasonable supply and
14 mix of all models manufactured for that line-make, or
15 unreasonably requires a dealer to pay any extra fee,
16 purchase unreasonable advertising displays or other
17 materials, or enter into a separate agreement which
18 adversely alters the rights or obligations contained
19 within the dealer’s existing franchise agreement or
20 which waives any right of the new motor vehicle dealer
21 or new powersports vehicle dealer as protected by
22 Section 561 et seq. of this title, or remodel,
23 renovate, or recondition the dealer’s existing
24 facilities as a prerequisite to receiving a model or
Req. No. 2061 Page 40
1 series of vehicles, except as may be necessary to sell
2 or service the model or series of vehicles as provided
3 by subparagraph e of this paragraph. It shall be a
4 violation of this section for new vehicle allocation
5 to be withheld subject to any requirement to purchase
6 or sell any number of used or off-lease vehicles. The
7 failure to deliver any such new motor vehicle shall
8 not be considered a violation of the section if the
9 failure is not arbitrary or is due to lack of
10 manufacturing capacity or to a strike or labor
11 difficulty, a shortage of materials, a freight
12 embargo, or other cause over which the manufacturer
13 has no control. However, this subparagraph shall not
14 apply to limited production model vehicles, a vehicle
15 not advertised by the factory for sale in this state,
16 vehicles that are subject to allocation affected by
17 federal environmental laws or environmental laws of
18 this state, or vehicles allocated in response to an
19 unforeseen event or circumstance,
20 e. except as necessary to comply with a health or safety
21 law, or to comply with a technology requirement which
22 is necessary to sell or service a vehicle that the
23 franchised new motor vehicle dealer or new powersports
24 vehicle dealer is authorized or licensed by the
Req. No. 2061 Page 41
1 franchisor to sell or service, requires a dealer to
2 construct a new facility or substantially renovate the
3 dealer’s existing facility unless the facility
4 construction or renovation is justified by the
5 economic conditions existing at the time, as well as
6 the reasonably foreseeable projections, in the new
7 motor vehicle dealer’s market and in the automotive
8 industry. However, this subparagraph shall not apply
9 if the new motor vehicle dealer or new powersports
10 vehicle dealer voluntarily agrees to facility
11 construction or renovation in exchange for money,
12 credit, allowance, reimbursement, or additional
13 vehicle allocation to a dealer from the factory to
14 compensate the dealer for the cost of, or a portion of
15 the cost of, the facility construction or renovation.
16 Except as necessary to comply with a health or safety
17 law, or to comply with a technology or safety
18 requirement which is necessary to sell or service a
19 motor vehicle or powersports vehicle that the
20 franchised dealer is authorized or licensed by the
21 franchisor to sell or service, a new vehicle dealer
22 which completes a facility construction or renovation
23 pursuant to factory requirements shall not be required
24 to construct a new facility or renovate the existing
Req. No. 2061 Page 42
1 facility if the same area of the facility or premises
2 has been constructed or substantially altered within
3 the last ten (10) years and the construction or
4 alteration was approved by the manufacturer as a part
5 of a facility upgrade program, standard, or policy.
6 For purposes of this subparagraph, “substantially
7 altered” means to perform an alteration that
8 substantially impacts the architectural features,
9 characteristics, or integrity of a structure or lot.
10 The term shall not include routine maintenance
11 reasonably necessary to maintain a dealership in
12 attractive condition. If a facility upgrade program,
13 standard, or policy under which the dealer completed a
14 facility construction or substantial alteration does
15 not contain a specific time period during which the
16 manufacturer or distributor shall provide payments or
17 benefits to a participating dealer, or the time frame
18 specified under the program is reduced or canceled
19 prematurely in the unilateral discretion of the
20 manufacturer or distributor, the manufacturer or
21 distributor shall not deny the participating dealer
22 any payment or benefit under the terms of the program,
23 standard, or policy as it existed when the dealer
24 began to perform under the program, standard, or
Req. No. 2061 Page 43
1 policy for the balance of the ten-year period,
2 regardless of whether the manufacturer’s or

7 f. requires a new motor vehicle dealer or new powersports
8 vehicle dealer to establish an exclusive facility,
9 unless supported by reasonable business, market, and
10 economic considerations; provided, that this section
11 shall not restrict the terms of any agreement for such
12 exclusive facility voluntarily entered into and
13 supported by valuable consideration separate from the
14 new motor vehicle dealer’s right to sell and service
15 motor vehicles for the franchisor,
16 g. requires a new motor vehicle dealer or new powersports
17 vehicle dealer to enter into a site-control agreement
18 covering any or all of the new motor vehicle dealer’s
19 facilities or premises; provided, that this section
20 shall not restrict the terms of any site-control
21 agreement voluntarily entered into and supported by
22 valuable consideration separate from the new motor
23 vehicle dealer’s right to sell and service motor
24 vehicles for the franchisor. Notwithstanding the
Req. No. 2061 Page 44
1 foregoing or the terms of any site-control agreement,
2 a site-control agreement automatically extinguishes if
3 all of the factory’s franchises that operated from the
4 location that are the subject of the site-control
5 agreement are terminated by the factory as part of the
6 discontinuance of a product line,
7 h. refuses to pay, or claims reimbursement from, a new
8 motor vehicle dealer or new powersports vehicle dealer
9 for sales, incentives, or other payments related to a
10 vehicle sold by the dealer because the purchaser of
11 the new vehicle exported or resold the vehicle in
12 violation of the policy of the factory unless the
13 factory can show that, at the time of the sale, the
14 new vehicle dealer knew or reasonably should have
15 known of the purchaser’s intention to export or resell
16 the vehicle. There is a rebuttable presumption that
17 the new vehicle dealer did not know or could not have
18 known that the vehicle would be exported if the
19 vehicle is titled and registered in any state of the
20 United States, or
21 i. requires a new motor vehicle dealer or new powersports
22 vehicle dealer to purchase goods or services for the
23 construction, renovation, or improvement of the new
24 dealer’s facility from a vendor chosen by the factory
Req. No. 2061 Page 45
1 if goods or services available from other sources are
2 of substantially similar quality and design and comply
3 with all applicable laws; provided, however, that such
4 goods are not subject to the factory’s intellectual
5 property or trademark rights and the new vehicle
6 dealer has received the factory’s approval, which
7 approval may not be unreasonably withheld. Nothing in
8 this subparagraph may be construed to allow a new
9 motor vehicle dealer or new powersports vehicle dealer
10 to impair or eliminate a factory’s intellectual
11 property, trademark rights, or trade dress usage
12 guidelines. Nothing in this section prohibits the
13 enforcement of a voluntary agreement between the
14 factory and the new vehicle dealer where separate and
15 valuable consideration has been offered and accepted;
16 10. Being a factory that:
17 a. establishes a system of motor vehicle allocation or
18 distribution which is unfair, inequitable, or
19 unreasonably discriminatory. Upon the request of any

22 writing to the dealer the basis upon which new
23 vehicles are allocated, scheduled, and delivered among

Req. No. 2061 Page 46
1 the new motor vehicle dealers of the same line-make
2 for that factory, or
3 b. changes an established plan or system of new motor
4 vehicle or new powersports vehicle distribution. A
5 new motor vehicle dealer or new powersports vehicle
6 dealer franchise agreement shall continue in full
7 force and operation notwithstanding a change, in whole
8 or in part, of an established plan or system of
9 distribution of the motor vehicles or new powersports
10 vehicles offered or previously offered for sale under
11 the franchise agreement. The appointment of a new
12 importer or distributor for motor vehicles or new
13 powersports vehicle offered for sale under the
14 franchise agreement shall be deemed to be a change of
15 an established plan or system of distribution. The
16 discontinuation of a line-make shall not be deemed to
17 be a change of an established plan or system of motor
18 vehicle or new powersports vehicle distribution. The
19 creation of a line-make shall not be deemed to be a
20 change of an established plan or system of motor
21 vehicle distribution as long as the new line-make is
22 not selling the same, or substantially the same
23 vehicle or vehicles previously sold through another
24 line-make by new motor vehicle dealers or new
Req. No. 2061 Page 47
1 powersports vehicle dealers with an active franchise
2 agreement for the other line-make in the state if such
3 dealers are no longer authorized to sell the
4 comparable vehicle previously sold through their line-
5 make. Changing a vehicle’s powertrain is not
6 sufficient to show it is substantially different.
7 Upon the occurrence of such change, the manufacturer
8 or distributor shall be prohibited from obtaining a
9 license to distribute vehicles under the new plan or
10 system of distribution unless the manufacturer or
11 distributor offers to each vehicle dealer who is a
12 party to the franchise agreement a new franchise
13 agreement containing substantially the same provisions
14 which were contained in the previous franchise
15 agreement;
16 11. Being a factory that sells directly or indirectly new motor
17 vehicles or new powersports vehicles to any retail consumer in the
18 state except through a new motor vehicle dealer or new powersports

21 does not apply to factory sales of new vehicles to its employees,
22 family members of employees, retirees and family members of
23 retirees, not-for-profit organizations, or the federal, state, or
24 local governments. The provisions of this paragraph shall not

2 purpose of marketing or facilitating a sale of a new vehicle or from
3 establishing a program to sell or offer to sell new motor vehicles

22 investment in the franchise and whose initial
23 investment is subject to potential loss. The

7 owning, operating, controlling, or acting in the
8 capacity of a new motor vehicle dealer or new
9 powersports vehicle dealer for a period not to
10 exceed twelve (12) months during the transition
11 from one independent dealer to another
12 independent dealer if the dealership is for sale
13 at a reasonable price and on reasonable terms and
14 conditions to an independent qualified buyer. On
15 showing by a factory of good cause, the Oklahoma
16 New Motor Vehicle Commission may extend the time
17 limit set forth above; extensions may be granted
18 for periods not to exceed twelve (12) months.
19 (3) This paragraph does not prohibit a factory from

10 a parts markup rate, labor rate, or both. The new
11 motor vehicle dealer or new powersports vehicle dealer
12 shall calculate its retail parts rate by determining
13 the total charges for parts from the qualified repair
14 orders submitted, dividing that amount by the new
15 motor vehicle dealer’s total cost of the purchase of
16 those parts, subtracting one (1), and multiplying by
17 one hundred (100) to produce a percentage. The new
18 motor vehicle dealer or new powersports vehicle dealer
19 shall calculate its retail labor rate by dividing the
20 amount of the new vehicle dealer’s total labor sales
21 from the qualified repair orders by the total labor
22 hours charged for those sales. When submitting repair
23 orders to establish a retail parts and labor rate, a
24
Req. No. 2061 Page 30

12 (5) repairs with aftermarket parts, when calculating
13 the retail parts rate but not the retail labor
14 rate,
15 (6) repairs on aftermarket parts,
16 (7) replacement of or work on tires including front-
17 end alignments and wheel or tire rotations,
18 (8) repairs of vehicles owned by the new motor
19 vehicle dealer or new powersports vehicle dealer

23 including, but not limited to, nuts, bolts, and
24 fasteners.
Req. No. 2061 Page 31

1 A manufacturer or distributor may, not later than
2 forty-five (45) days after submission, rebut that
3 declared retail parts and labor rate in writing by
4 reasonably substantiating that the rate is not
5 accurate or is incomplete pursuant to the provisions
6 of this section. If the manufacturer or distributor
7 determines the set of repair orders submitted by the
8 new motor vehicle dealer or new powersports vehicle
9 dealer pursuant to this section for a retail labor
10 rate or retail parts markup rate is substantially
11 higher than the new vehicle dealer’s current warranty
12 rates, the manufacturer or distributor may request, in
13 writing, within forty-five (45) days after the
14 manufacturer’s or distributor’s receipt of the new
15 vehicle dealer’s initial submission, all repair orders
16 closed within the period of thirty (30) days
17 immediately preceding, or thirty (30) days immediately
18 following, the set of repair orders initially
19 submitted by the new motor vehicle dealer. All time
20 periods under this section shall be suspended until
21 the supplemental repair orders are provided. If the
22 manufacturer or distributor requests supplemental
23 repair orders, the manufacturer or distributor may,
24 within thirty (30) days after receiving the
Req. No. 2061 Page 32

1 supplemental repair orders and in accordance with the
2 formula described in this subsection, calculate a
3 proposed adjusted retail labor rate or retail parts
4 markup rate, as applicable, based upon any set of the
5 qualified repair orders submitted by the franchisee
6 and following the formula set forth herein to
7 establish the rate. The retail labor and parts rates
8 shall go into effect thirty (30) days following the
9 approval by the manufacturer or distributor. If the
10 declared rate is rebutted, the manufacturer or
11 distributor shall provide written notice stating the
12 reasons for the rebuttal, an explanation of the
13 reasons for the rebuttal, and a copy of all
14 calculations used by the franchisor in determining the
15 manufacturer or distributor’s position and propose an
16 adjustment in writing of the average percentage markup
17 or labor rate based on that rebuttal not later than
18 forty-five (45) days after submission. If the new
19 motor vehicle dealer or new powersports vehicle dealer
20 does not agree with the proposed average percentage
21 markup or labor rate, the new vehicle dealer may file
22 a protest with the Commission not later than thirty
23 (30) days after receipt of that proposal by the
24 manufacturer or distributor. In the event a protest
Req. No. 2061 Page 33

1 is filed, the manufacturer or distributor shall have
2 the burden of proof to establish the new vehicle
3 dealer’s submitted parts markup rate or labor rate was
4 inaccurate or not complete pursuant to the provisions
5 of this section. A manufacturer or distributor may
6 not retaliate against any new motor vehicle dealer or
7 new powersports vehicle dealer seeking to exercise its
8 rights under this section. A manufacturer or
9 distributor may require a dealer to submit repair
10 orders in accordance with this section in order to
11 validate the reasonableness of a dealer’s retail rate
12 for parts or labor not more often than once every
13 twelve (12) months. A manufacturer or distributor may
14 not otherwise recover its costs from new vehicle
15 dealers within this state including a surcharge
16 imposed on a new motor vehicle dealer solely intended
17 to recover the cost of reimbursing a dealer for parts
18 and labor pursuant to this section; provided, a
19 manufacturer or distributor shall not be prohibited
20 from increasing prices for vehicles or parts in the
21 normal course of business or from auditing and
22 charging back claims in accordance with this section.
23 All claims made by dealers for compensation for
24 delivery, preparation, warranty, or recall repair work
Req. No. 2061 Page 34

1 shall be paid within thirty (30) days after approval
2 and shall be approved or disapproved within thirty
3 (30) days after receipt. When any claim is
4 disapproved, the dealer shall be notified in writing
5 of the grounds for disapproval. The dealer’s
6 delivery, preparation, and warranty obligations as
7 filed with the Commission shall constitute the
8 dealer’s sole responsibility for product liability as
9 between the dealer and manufacturer. A factory may
10 reasonably and periodically audit a new motor vehicle
11 dealer or new powersports vehicle dealer to determine
12 the validity of paid claims for dealer compensation or
13 any charge-backs for warranty parts or service
14 compensation. Except in cases of suspected fraud,
15 audits of warranty payments shall only be for the one-
16 year period immediately following the date of the
17 payment. A manufacturer shall reserve the right to
18 reasonable, periodic audits to determine the validity
19 of paid claims for dealer compensation or any charge-
20 backs for consumer or dealer incentives. Except in
21 cases of suspected fraud, audits of incentive payments
22 shall only be for a one-year period immediately
23 following the date of the payment. A factory shall
24 not deny a claim or charge a new motor vehicle dealer
Req. No. 2061 Page 35

1 back subsequent to the payment of the claim unless the
2 factory can show that the claim was false or
3 fraudulent or that the new motor vehicle dealer or new
4 powersports vehicle dealer failed to reasonably
5 substantiate the claim by the written reasonable
6 procedures of the factory. A factory shall not deny a
7 claim or implement a charge-back against a new vehicle
8 dealer after payment of a claim in the event a
9 purchaser of a new vehicle that is the subject of a
10 claim fails to comply with titling or registration
11 laws of this state and is not prevented from
12 compliance by any action of the dealer; provided, that
13 the factory may require the dealer to provide, within
14 thirty (30) days of notice of charge-back, withholding
15 of payment, or denial of claim, the documentation to
16 demonstrate the vehicle sale, delivery, and customer
17 qualification for an incentive as reported, including
18 consumer name and address and written attestation
19 signed by the dealer operator or general manager
20 stating the consumer was not on the export control
21 list and the dealer did not know or have reason to
22 know the vehicle was being exported or resold.
23 The factory shall provide written notice to a dealer
24 of a proposed charge-back that is the result of an
Req. No. 2061 Page 36

1 audit along with the specific audit results and
2 proposed charge-back amount. A dealer that receives
3 notice of a proposed charge-back pursuant to a
4 factory’s audit has the right to file a protest with
5 the Commission within thirty (30) days after receipt
6 of the notice of the charge-back or audit results,
7 whichever is later. The factory is prohibited from
8 implementing the charge-back or debiting the dealer’s
9 account until either the time frame for filing a
10 protest has passed or a final adjudication is rendered
11 by the Commission, whichever is later, unless the
12 dealer has agreed to the charge-back or charge-backs,
13 c. fails to compensate the new motor vehicle dealer for a
14 used motor vehicle:
15 (1) that is of the same make and model manufactured,

18 franchised to sell or on which the new motor
19 vehicle dealer is authorized to perform recall
20 repairs,
21 (2) that is subject to a stop-sale or do-not-drive

5 inventory after the recall notice as a result of
6 a retail consumer trade-in or a lease return to
7 the dealer inventory in accordance with an
8 applicable lease contract,
9 (4) that cannot be repaired due to the
10 unavailability, within thirty (30) days after
11 issuance of the stop-sale or do-not-drive order,
12 of a remedy or parts necessary for the new motor
13 vehicle dealer to make the recall repair, and
14 (5) that is not at least in the prorated amount of
15 one percent (1.00%) of the value of the vehicle
16 per month beginning on the date that is thirty
17 (30) days after the date on which the stop-sale
18 order was provided to the new motor vehicle
19 dealer until the earlier of either of the
20 following:
21 (a) the date the recall remedy or parts are made
22 available, or
23
24
Req. No. 2061 Page 38

1 (b) the date the new motor vehicle dealer sells,
2 trades, or otherwise disposes of the
3 affected used motor vehicle.
4 For the purposes of division (5) of this subparagraph,
5 the value of a used vehicle shall be the average Black
6 Book value for the year, make, and model of the
7 recalled vehicle. A factory may direct the manner and
8 method in which a new motor vehicle dealer must
9 demonstrate the inventory status of an affected used
10 motor vehicle to determine eligibility under this
11 subparagraph; provided, that the manner and method may
12 not be unduly burdensome and may not require
13 information that is unduly burdensome to provide. All
14 reimbursement claims made by new motor vehicle dealers
15 pursuant to this section for recall remedies or
16 repairs, or for compensation where no part or repair
17 is reasonably available and the vehicle is subject to
18 a stop-sale or do-not-drive order, shall be subject to
19 the same limitations and requirements as a warranty
20 reimbursement claim made under subparagraph b of this
21 paragraph. In the alternative, a manufacturer may
22 compensate its franchised new motor vehicle dealers
23 under a national recall compensation program;
24 provided, the compensation under the program is equal
Req. No. 2061 Page 39

1 to or greater than that provided under division (5) of
2 this subparagraph, or as the manufacturer and new
3 motor vehicle dealer otherwise agree. Nothing in this
4 section shall require a factory to provide total
5 compensation to a new motor vehicle dealer which would
6 exceed the total average Black Book value of the
7 affected used motor vehicle as originally determined
8 under division (5) of this subparagraph. Any remedy
9 provided to a new motor vehicle dealer under this
10 subparagraph is exclusive and may not be combined with
11 any other state or federal compensation remedy,
12 d. unreasonably fails or refuses to offer to its same
13 line-make franchised dealers a reasonable supply and
14 mix of all models manufactured for that line-make, or
15 unreasonably requires a dealer to pay any extra fee,
16 purchase unreasonable advertising displays or other
17 materials, or enter into a separate agreement which
18 adversely alters the rights or obligations contained
19 within the dealer’s existing franchise agreement or
20 which waives any right of the new motor vehicle dealer
21 or new powersports vehicle dealer as protected by
22 Section 561 et seq. of this title, or remodel,
23 renovate, or recondition the dealer’s existing
24 facilities as a prerequisite to receiving a model or
Req. No. 2061 Page 40

1 series of vehicles, except as may be necessary to sell
2 or service the model or series of vehicles as provided
3 by subparagraph e of this paragraph. It shall be a
4 violation of this section for new vehicle allocation
5 to be withheld subject to any requirement to purchase
6 or sell any number of used or off-lease vehicles. The
7 failure to deliver any such new motor vehicle shall
8 not be considered a violation of the section if the
9 failure is not arbitrary or is due to lack of
10 manufacturing capacity or to a strike or labor
11 difficulty, a shortage of materials, a freight
12 embargo, or other cause over which the manufacturer
13 has no control. However, this subparagraph shall not
14 apply to limited production model vehicles, a vehicle
15 not advertised by the factory for sale in this state,
16 vehicles that are subject to allocation affected by
17 federal environmental laws or environmental laws of
18 this state, or vehicles allocated in response to an
19 unforeseen event or circumstance,
20 e. except as necessary to comply with a health or safety
21 law, or to comply with a technology requirement which
22 is necessary to sell or service a vehicle that the
23 franchised new motor vehicle dealer or new powersports
24 vehicle dealer is authorized or licensed by the
Req. No. 2061 Page 41

1 franchisor to sell or service, requires a dealer to
2 construct a new facility or substantially renovate the
3 dealer’s existing facility unless the facility
4 construction or renovation is justified by the
5 economic conditions existing at the time, as well as
6 the reasonably foreseeable projections, in the new
7 motor vehicle dealer’s market and in the automotive
8 industry. However, this subparagraph shall not apply
9 if the new motor vehicle dealer or new powersports
10 vehicle dealer voluntarily agrees to facility
11 construction or renovation in exchange for money,
12 credit, allowance, reimbursement, or additional
13 vehicle allocation to a dealer from the factory to
14 compensate the dealer for the cost of, or a portion of
15 the cost of, the facility construction or renovation.
16 Except as necessary to comply with a health or safety
17 law, or to comply with a technology or safety
18 requirement which is necessary to sell or service a
19 motor vehicle or powersports vehicle that the
20 franchised dealer is authorized or licensed by the
21 franchisor to sell or service, a new vehicle dealer
22 which completes a facility construction or renovation
23 pursuant to factory requirements shall not be required
24 to construct a new facility or renovate the existing
Req. No. 2061 Page 42

1 facility if the same area of the facility or premises
2 has been constructed or substantially altered within
3 the last ten (10) years and the construction or
4 alteration was approved by the manufacturer as a part
5 of a facility upgrade program, standard, or policy.
6 For purposes of this subparagraph, “substantially
7 altered” means to perform an alteration that
8 substantially impacts the architectural features,
9 characteristics, or integrity of a structure or lot.
10 The term shall not include routine maintenance
11 reasonably necessary to maintain a dealership in
12 attractive condition. If a facility upgrade program,
13 standard, or policy under which the dealer completed a
14 facility construction or substantial alteration does
15 not contain a specific time period during which the
16 manufacturer or distributor shall provide payments or
17 benefits to a participating dealer, or the time frame
18 specified under the program is reduced or canceled
19 prematurely in the unilateral discretion of the
20 manufacturer or distributor, the manufacturer or
21 distributor shall not deny the participating dealer
22 any payment or benefit under the terms of the program,
23 standard, or policy as it existed when the dealer
24 began to perform under the program, standard, or
Req. No. 2061 Page 43

1 policy for the balance of the ten-year period,
2 regardless of whether the manufacturer’s or
3 distributor’s program, standard, or policy has been
4 changed or canceled, unless the manufacturer and
5 dealer agree, in writing, to the change in payment or
6 benefit,
7 f. requires a new motor vehicle dealer or new powersports
8 vehicle dealer to establish an exclusive facility,
9 unless supported by reasonable business, market, and
10 economic considerations; provided, that this section
11 shall not restrict the terms of any agreement for such
12 exclusive facility voluntarily entered into and
13 supported by valuable consideration separate from the
14 new motor vehicle dealer’s right to sell and service
15 motor vehicles for the franchisor,
16 g. requires a new motor vehicle dealer or new powersports
17 vehicle dealer to enter into a site-control agreement
18 covering any or all of the new motor vehicle dealer’s
19 facilities or premises; provided, that this section
20 shall not restrict the terms of any site-control
21 agreement voluntarily entered into and supported by
22 valuable consideration separate from the new motor
23 vehicle dealer’s right to sell and service motor
24 vehicles for the franchisor. Notwithstanding the
Req. No. 2061 Page 44

1 foregoing or the terms of any site-control agreement,
2 a site-control agreement automatically extinguishes if
3 all of the factory’s franchises that operated from the
4 location that are the subject of the site-control
5 agreement are terminated by the factory as part of the
6 discontinuance of a product line,
7 h. refuses to pay, or claims reimbursement from, a new
8 motor vehicle dealer or new powersports vehicle dealer
9 for sales, incentives, or other payments related to a
10 vehicle sold by the dealer because the purchaser of
11 the new vehicle exported or resold the vehicle in
12 violation of the policy of the factory unless the
13 factory can show that, at the time of the sale, the
14 new vehicle dealer knew or reasonably should have
15 known of the purchaser’s intention to export or resell
16 the vehicle. There is a rebuttable presumption that
17 the new vehicle dealer did not know or could not have
18 known that the vehicle would be exported if the
19 vehicle is titled and registered in any state of the
20 United States, or
21 i. requires a new motor vehicle dealer or new powersports
22 vehicle dealer to purchase goods or services for the
23 construction, renovation, or improvement of the new
24 dealer’s facility from a vendor chosen by the factory
Req. No. 2061 Page 45

1 if goods or services available from other sources are
2 of substantially similar quality and design and comply
3 with all applicable laws; provided, however, that such
4 goods are not subject to the factory’s intellectual
5 property or trademark rights and the new vehicle
6 dealer has received the factory’s approval, which
7 approval may not be unreasonably withheld. Nothing in
8 this subparagraph may be construed to allow a new
9 motor vehicle dealer or new powersports vehicle dealer
10 to impair or eliminate a factory’s intellectual
11 property, trademark rights, or trade dress usage
12 guidelines. Nothing in this section prohibits the
13 enforcement of a voluntary agreement between the
14 factory and the new vehicle dealer where separate and
15 valuable consideration has been offered and accepted;
16 10. Being a factory that:
17 a. establishes a system of motor vehicle allocation or
18 distribution which is unfair, inequitable, or
19 unreasonably discriminatory. Upon the request of any
20 new motor vehicle dealer or new powersports vehicle
21 dealer franchised by it, a factory shall disclose in
22 writing to the dealer the basis upon which new
23 vehicles are allocated, scheduled, and delivered among
24
Req. No. 2061 Page 46

1 the new motor vehicle dealers of the same line-make
2 for that factory, or
3 b. changes an established plan or system of new motor
4 vehicle or new powersports vehicle distribution. A
5 new motor vehicle dealer or new powersports vehicle
6 dealer franchise agreement shall continue in full
7 force and operation notwithstanding a change, in whole
8 or in part, of an established plan or system of
9 distribution of the motor vehicles or new powersports
10 vehicles offered or previously offered for sale under
11 the franchise agreement. The appointment of a new
12 importer or distributor for motor vehicles or new
13 powersports vehicle offered for sale under the
14 franchise agreement shall be deemed to be a change of
15 an established plan or system of distribution. The
16 discontinuation of a line-make shall not be deemed to
17 be a change of an established plan or system of motor
18 vehicle or new powersports vehicle distribution. The
19 creation of a line-make shall not be deemed to be a
20 change of an established plan or system of motor
21 vehicle distribution as long as the new line-make is
22 not selling the same, or substantially the same
23 vehicle or vehicles previously sold through another
24 line-make by new motor vehicle dealers or new
Req. No. 2061 Page 47

1 powersports vehicle dealers with an active franchise
2 agreement for the other line-make in the state if such
3 dealers are no longer authorized to sell the
4 comparable vehicle previously sold through their line-
5 make. Changing a vehicle’s powertrain is not
6 sufficient to show it is substantially different.
7 Upon the occurrence of such change, the manufacturer
8 or distributor shall be prohibited from obtaining a
9 license to distribute vehicles under the new plan or
10 system of distribution unless the manufacturer or
11 distributor offers to each vehicle dealer who is a
12 party to the franchise agreement a new franchise
13 agreement containing substantially the same provisions
14 which were contained in the previous franchise
15 agreement;
16 11. Being a factory that sells directly or indirectly new motor
17 vehicles or new powersports vehicles to any retail consumer in the
18 state except through a new motor vehicle dealer or new powersports
19 vehicle dealer holding a franchise for the line-make that includes
20 the new motor vehicle or new powersports vehicle. This paragraph
21 does not apply to factory sales of new vehicles to its employees,
22 family members of employees, retirees and family members of
23 retirees, not-for-profit organizations, or the federal, state, or
24 local governments. The provisions of this paragraph shall not

2 purpose of marketing or facilitating a sale of a new vehicle or from
3 establishing a program to sell or offer to sell new motor vehicles
4 or new powersports vehicle through participating dealers subject to
5 the limitations provided in paragraph 2 of Section 562 of this
6 title;
7 12. a. Being a factory which directly or indirectly:

13 (2) operates or controls a new motor vehicle dealer
14 or new powersports vehicle dealer, or
15 (3) acts in the capacity of a new motor vehicle
16 dealer or new powersports vehicle dealer.

18 owning or controlling a new motor vehicle dealer
19 or new powersports vehicle dealer while in a bona
20 fide relationship with a dealer development
21 candidate who has made a substantial initial
22 investment in the franchise and whose initial
23 investment is subject to potential loss. The
24 dealer development candidate can reasonably

1 expect to acquire full ownership of a new vehicle
2 dealer within a reasonable period of time not to
3 exceed ten (10) years and on reasonable terms and

5 be expanded for good cause shown.
6 (2) This paragraph does not prohibit a factory from
7 owning, operating, controlling, or acting in the
8 capacity of a new motor vehicle dealer or new
9 powersports vehicle dealer for a period not to
10 exceed twelve (12) months during the transition
11 from one independent dealer to another
12 independent dealer if the dealership is for sale
13 at a reasonable price and on reasonable terms and
14 conditions to an independent qualified buyer. On
15 showing by a factory of good cause, the Oklahoma
16 New Motor Vehicle Commission may extend the time
17 limit set forth above; extensions may be granted
18 for periods not to exceed twelve (12) months.
19 (3) This paragraph does not prohibit a factory from
20 owning, operating, or controlling or acting in

17 many dealership facilities as the dealer and
18 manufacturer shall agree are appropriate,
19 (c) at the time the manufacturer first acquires
