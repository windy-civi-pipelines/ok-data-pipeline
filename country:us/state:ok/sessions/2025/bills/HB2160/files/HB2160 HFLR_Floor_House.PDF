15 whichever is less, covering repairs made no more than
16 one hundred eighty (180) days before the submission
17 and declaring the average percentage labor rate and/or
18 markup rate. A motor vehicle dealer may not submit a
19 request to establish its retail rates more than once
20 in a twelve-month period. That request may establish
21 a parts markup rate, labor rate, or both. The new
22 motor vehicle dealer or new powersports vehicle dealer
23 shall calculate its retail parts rate by determining
24 the total charges for parts from the qualified repair
HB2160 HFLR Page 30
BOLD FACE denotes Committee Amendments.

1 orders submitted, dividing that amount by the new
2 motor vehicle dealer's total cost of the purchase of
3 those parts, subtracting one (1), and multiplying by
4 one hundred (100) to produce a percentage. The new
5 motor vehicle dealer or new powersports vehicle dealer
6 shall calculate its retail labor rate by dividing the
7 amount of the new vehicle dealer's total labor sales
8 from the qualified repair orders by the total labor
9 hours charged for those sales. When submitting repair
10 orders to establish a retail parts and labor rate, a
11 new motor vehicle dealer or new powersports vehicle
12 dealer need not include repairs for:
13 (1) routine maintenance including but not limited to
14 the replacement of bulbs, fluids, filters,
15 batteries, and belts that are not provided in the
16 course of and related to a repair,
17 (2) factory special events, specials, or promotional
18 discounts for retail consumer repairs,
19 (3) parts sold or repairs performed at wholesale,
20 (4) factory-approved goodwill or policy repairs or
21 replacements,
22 (5) repairs with aftermarket parts, when calculating
23 the retail parts rate but not the retail labor
24 rate,

7 (9) vehicle reconditioning, or
8 (10) items that do not have individual part numbers
9 including, but not limited to, nuts, bolts, and
10 fasteners.
11 A manufacturer or distributor may, not later than
12 forty-five (45) days after submission, rebut that
13 declared retail parts and labor rate in writing by
14 reasonably substantiating that the rate is not
15 accurate or is incomplete pursuant to the provisions
16 of this section. If the manufacturer or distributor
17 determines the set of repair orders submitted by the
18 new motor vehicle dealer or new powersports vehicle
19 dealer pursuant to this section for a retail labor
20 rate or retail parts markup rate is substantially
21 higher than the new vehicle dealer's current warranty
22 rates, the manufacturer or distributor may request, in
23 writing, within forty-five (45) days after the
24 manufacturer's or distributor's receipt of the new

2 closed within the period of thirty (30) days
3 immediately preceding, or thirty (30) days immediately
4 following, the set of repair orders initially
5 submitted by the new motor vehicle dealer. All time
6 periods under this section shall be suspended until
7 the supplemental repair orders are provided. If the
8 manufacturer or distributor requests supplemental
9 repair orders, the manufacturer or distributor may,
10 within thirty (30) days after receiving the
11 supplemental repair orders and in accordance with the
12 formula described in this subsection, calculate a
13 proposed adjusted retail labor rate or retail parts
14 markup rate, as applicable, based upon any set of the
15 qualified repair orders submitted by the franchisee
16 and following the formula set forth herein to
17 establish the rate. The retail labor and parts rates
18 shall go into effect thirty (30) days following the
19 approval by the manufacturer or distributor. If the
20 declared rate is rebutted, the manufacturer or
21 distributor shall provide written notice stating the
22 reasons for the rebuttal, an explanation of the
23 reasons for the rebuttal, and a copy of all
24 calculations used by the franchisor in determining the

6 does not agree with the proposed average percentage
7 markup or labor rate, the new vehicle dealer may file
8 a protest with the Commission not later than thirty
9 (30) days after receipt of that proposal by the
10 manufacturer or distributor. In the event a protest
11 is filed, the manufacturer or distributor shall have
12 the burden of proof to establish the new vehicle
13 dealer's submitted parts markup rate or labor rate was
14 inaccurate or not complete pursuant to the provisions
15 of this section. A manufacturer or distributor may
16 not retaliate against any new motor vehicle dealer or
17 new powersports vehicle dealer seeking to exercise its
18 rights under this section. A manufacturer or
19 distributor may require a dealer to submit repair
20 orders in accordance with this section in order to
21 validate the reasonableness of a dealer's retail rate
22 for parts or labor not more often than once every
23 twelve (12) months. A manufacturer or distributor may
24 not otherwise recover its costs from new vehicle

6 from increasing prices for vehicles or parts in the
7 normal course of business or from auditing and
8 charging back claims in accordance with this section.
9 All claims made by dealers for compensation for
10 delivery, preparation, warranty, or recall repair work
11 shall be paid within thirty (30) days after approval
12 and shall be approved or disapproved within thirty
13 (30) days after receipt. When any claim is
14 disapproved, the dealer shall be notified in writing
15 of the grounds for disapproval. The dealer's
16 delivery, preparation, and warranty obligations as
17 filed with the Commission shall constitute the
18 dealer's sole responsibility for product liability as
19 between the dealer and manufacturer. A factory may
20 reasonably and periodically audit a new motor vehicle
21 dealer or new powersports vehicle dealer to determine
22 the validity of paid claims for dealer compensation or
23 any charge-backs for warranty parts or service
24 compensation. Except in cases of suspected fraud,

5 of paid claims for dealer compensation or any charge-
6 backs for consumer or dealer incentives. Except in
7 cases of suspected fraud, audits of incentive payments
8 shall only be for a one-year period immediately
9 following the date of the payment. A factory shall
10 not deny a claim or charge a new motor vehicle dealer
11 back subsequent to the payment of the claim unless the
12 factory can show that the claim was false or
13 fraudulent or that the new motor vehicle dealer or new
14 powersports vehicle dealer failed to reasonably
15 substantiate the claim by the written reasonable
16 procedures of the factory. A factory shall not deny a
17 claim or implement a charge-back against a new vehicle
18 dealer after payment of a claim in the event a
19 purchaser of a new vehicle that is the subject of a
20 claim fails to comply with titling or registration
21 laws of this state and is not prevented from
22 compliance by any action of the dealer; provided, that
23 the factory may require the dealer to provide, within

9 The factory shall provide written notice to a dealer
10 of a proposed charge-back that is the result of an

14 factory's audit has the right to file a protest with
15 the Commission within thirty (30) days after receipt
16 of the notice of the charge-back or audit results,

18 implementing the charge-back or debiting the dealer's
19 account until either the time frame for filing a
20 protest has passed or a final adjudication is rendered
21 by the Commission, whichever is later, unless the

11 For the purposes of division (5) of this subparagraph,
12 the value of a used vehicle shall be the average Black

10 by subparagraph e of this paragraph. It shall be a
11 violation of this section for new vehicle allocation

13 or sell any number of used or off-lease vehicles. The
14 failure to deliver any such new motor vehicle shall
15 not be considered a violation of the section if the
16 failure is not arbitrary or is due to lack of
17 manufacturing capacity or to a strike or labor
