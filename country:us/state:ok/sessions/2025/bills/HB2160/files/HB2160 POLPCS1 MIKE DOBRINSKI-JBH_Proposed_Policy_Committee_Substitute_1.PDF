7 consecutive days of nonwarranty consumer-paid service
8 repair orders which contain warranty-like repairs,
9 whichever is less, covering repairs made no more than
10 one hundred eighty (180) days before the submission
11 and declaring the average percentage labor rate and/or
12 markup rate. A motor vehicle dealer may not submit a
13 request to establish its retail rates more than once
14 in a twelve-month period. That request may establish
15 a parts markup rate, labor rate, or both. The new
16 motor vehicle dealer or new powersports vehicle dealer
17 shall calculate its retail parts rate by determining
18 the total charges for parts from the qualified repair
19 orders submitted, dividing that amount by the new
20 motor vehicle dealer's total cost of the purchase of
21 those parts, subtracting one (1), and multiplying by
22 one hundred (100) to produce a percentage. The new
23 motor vehicle dealer or new powersports vehicle dealer
24 shall calculate its retail labor rate by dividing the
Req. No. 12302 Page 30
1 amount of the new vehicle dealer's total labor sales
2 from the qualified repair orders by the total labor
3 hours charged for those sales. When submitting repair
4 orders to establish a retail parts and labor rate, a
5 new motor vehicle dealer or new powersports vehicle
6 dealer need not include repairs for:
7 (1) routine maintenance including but not limited to
8 the replacement of bulbs, fluids, filters,
9 batteries, and belts that are not provided in the
10 course of and related to a repair,
11 (2) factory special events, specials, or promotional
12 discounts for retail consumer repairs,
13 (3) parts sold or repairs performed at wholesale,
14 (4) factory-approved goodwill or policy repairs or
15 replacements,
16 (5) repairs with aftermarket parts, when calculating
17 the retail parts rate but not the retail labor
18 rate,
19 (6) repairs on aftermarket parts,
20 (7) replacement of or work on tires including front-
21 end alignments and wheel or tire rotations,
22 (8) repairs of vehicles owned by the new motor
23 vehicle dealer or new powersports vehicle dealer
24 or employee thereof at the time of the repair,
Req. No. 12302 Page 31
1 (9) vehicle reconditioning, or
2 (10) items that do not have individual part numbers
3 including, but not limited to, nuts, bolts, and
4 fasteners.
5 A manufacturer or distributor may, not later than
6 forty-five (45) days after submission, rebut that
7 declared retail parts and labor rate in writing by
8 reasonably substantiating that the rate is not
9 accurate or is incomplete pursuant to the provisions
10 of this section. If the manufacturer or distributor
11 determines the set of repair orders submitted by the
12 new motor vehicle dealer or new powersports vehicle
13 dealer pursuant to this section for a retail labor
14 rate or retail parts markup rate is substantially
15 higher than the new vehicle dealer's current warranty
16 rates, the manufacturer or distributor may request, in
17 writing, within forty-five (45) days after the
18 manufacturer's or distributor's receipt of the new
19 vehicle dealer's initial submission, all repair orders
20 closed within the period of thirty (30) days
21 immediately preceding, or thirty (30) days immediately
22 following, the set of repair orders initially
23 submitted by the new motor vehicle dealer. All time
24 periods under this section shall be suspended until
Req. No. 12302 Page 32
1 the supplemental repair orders are provided. If the
2 manufacturer or distributor requests supplemental
3 repair orders, the manufacturer or distributor may,
4 within thirty (30) days after receiving the
5 supplemental repair orders and in accordance with the
6 formula described in this subsection, calculate a
7 proposed adjusted retail labor rate or retail parts
8 markup rate, as applicable, based upon any set of the
9 qualified repair orders submitted by the franchisee
10 and following the formula set forth herein to
11 establish the rate. The retail labor and parts rates
12 shall go into effect thirty (30) days following the
13 approval by the manufacturer or distributor. If the
14 declared rate is rebutted, the manufacturer or
15 distributor shall provide written notice stating the
16 reasons for the rebuttal, an explanation of the
17 reasons for the rebuttal, and a copy of all
18 calculations used by the franchisor in determining the
19 manufacturer or distributor's position and propose an
20 adjustment in writing of the average percentage markup
21 or labor rate based on that rebuttal not later than
22 forty-five (45) days after submission. If the new
23 motor vehicle dealer or new powersports vehicle dealer
24 does not agree with the proposed average percentage
Req. No. 12302 Page 33
1 markup or labor rate, the new vehicle dealer may file
2 a protest with the Commission not later than thirty
3 (30) days after receipt of that proposal by the
4 manufacturer or distributor. In the event a protest
5 is filed, the manufacturer or distributor shall have
6 the burden of proof to establish the new vehicle
7 dealer's submitted parts markup rate or labor rate was
8 inaccurate or not complete pursuant to the provisions
9 of this section. A manufacturer or distributor may
10 not retaliate against any new motor vehicle dealer or
11 new powersports vehicle dealer seeking to exercise its
12 rights under this section. A manufacturer or
13 distributor may require a dealer to submit repair
14 orders in accordance with this section in order to
15 validate the reasonableness of a dealer's retail rate
16 for parts or labor not more often than once every
17 twelve (12) months. A manufacturer or distributor may
18 not otherwise recover its costs from new vehicle
19 dealers within this state including a surcharge
20 imposed on a new motor vehicle dealer solely intended
21 to recover the cost of reimbursing a dealer for parts
22 and labor pursuant to this section; provided, a
23 manufacturer or distributor shall not be prohibited
24 from increasing prices for vehicles or parts in the
Req. No. 12302 Page 34
1 normal course of business or from auditing and
2 charging back claims in accordance with this section.
3 All claims made by dealers for compensation for
4 delivery, preparation, warranty, or recall repair work
5 shall be paid within thirty (30) days after approval
6 and shall be approved or disapproved within thirty
7 (30) days after receipt. When any claim is
8 disapproved, the dealer shall be notified in writing
9 of the grounds for disapproval. The dealer's
10 delivery, preparation, and warranty obligations as
11 filed with the Commission shall constitute the
12 dealer's sole responsibility for product liability as
13 between the dealer and manufacturer. A factory may
14 reasonably and periodically audit a new motor vehicle
15 dealer or new powersports vehicle dealer to determine
16 the validity of paid claims for dealer compensation or
17 any charge-backs for warranty parts or service
18 compensation. Except in cases of suspected fraud,
19 audits of warranty payments shall only be for the one-
20 year period immediately following the date of the
21 payment. A manufacturer shall reserve the right to
22 reasonable, periodic audits to determine the validity
23 of paid claims for dealer compensation or any charge-
24 backs for consumer or dealer incentives. Except in
Req. No. 12302 Page 35
1 cases of suspected fraud, audits of incentive payments
2 shall only be for a one-year period immediately
3 following the date of the payment. A factory shall
4 not deny a claim or charge a new motor vehicle dealer
5 back subsequent to the payment of the claim unless the
6 factory can show that the claim was false or
7 fraudulent or that the new motor vehicle dealer or new
8 powersports vehicle dealer failed to reasonably
9 substantiate the claim by the written reasonable
10 procedures of the factory. A factory shall not deny a
11 claim or implement a charge-back against a new vehicle
12 dealer after payment of a claim in the event a
13 purchaser of a new vehicle that is the subject of a
14 claim fails to comply with titling or registration
15 laws of this state and is not prevented from
16 compliance by any action of the dealer; provided, that
17 the factory may require the dealer to provide, within
18 thirty (30) days of notice of charge-back, withholding
19 of payment, or denial of claim, the documentation to
20 demonstrate the vehicle sale, delivery, and customer
21 qualification for an incentive as reported, including
22 consumer name and address and written attestation
23 signed by the dealer operator or general manager
24 stating the consumer was not on the export control
Req. No. 12302 Page 36
1 list and the dealer did not know or have reason to
2 know the vehicle was being exported or resold.
3 The factory shall provide written notice to a dealer
4 of a proposed charge-back that is the result of an
5 audit along with the specific audit results and
6 proposed charge-back amount. A dealer that receives
7 notice of a proposed charge-back pursuant to a
8 factory's audit has the right to file a protest with
9 the Commission within thirty (30) days after receipt
10 of the notice of the charge-back or audit results,
11 whichever is later. The factory is prohibited from
12 implementing the charge-back or debiting the dealer's
13 account until either the time frame for filing a
14 protest has passed or a final adjudication is rendered
15 by the Commission, whichever is later, unless the
16 dealer has agreed to the charge-back or charge-backs,
17 c. fails to compensate the new motor vehicle dealer for a
18 used motor vehicle:
19 (1) that is of the same make and model manufactured,
20 imported, or distributed by the factory and is a
21 line-make that the new motor vehicle dealer is
22 franchised to sell or on which the new motor
23 vehicle dealer is authorized to perform recall
24 repairs,
Req. No. 12302 Page 37
1 (2) that is subject to a stop-sale or do-not-drive
2 order issued by the factory or an authorized
3 governmental agency,
4 (3) that is held by the new motor vehicle dealer in
5 the dealer's inventory at the time the stop-sale
6 or do-not-drive order is issued or that is taken
7 by the new motor vehicle dealer into the dealer's
8 inventory after the recall notice as a result of
9 a retail consumer trade-in or a lease return to
10 the dealer inventory in accordance with an
11 applicable lease contract,
12 (4) that cannot be repaired due to the
13 unavailability, within thirty (30) days after
14 issuance of the stop-sale or do-not-drive order,
15 of a remedy or parts necessary for the new motor
16 vehicle dealer to make the recall repair, and
17 (5) that is not at least in the prorated amount of
18 one percent (1.00%) of the value of the vehicle
19 per month beginning on the date that is thirty
20 (30) days after the date on which the stop-sale
21 order was provided to the new motor vehicle
22 dealer until the earlier of either of the
23 following:
24
Req. No. 12302 Page 38
1 (a) the date the recall remedy or parts are made
2 available, or
3 (b) the date the new motor vehicle dealer sells,
4 trades, or otherwise disposes of the
5 affected used motor vehicle.
6 For the purposes of division (5) of this subparagraph,
7 the value of a used vehicle shall be the average Black
8 Book value for the year, make, and model of the
9 recalled vehicle. A factory may direct the manner and
10 method in which a new motor vehicle dealer must
11 demonstrate the inventory status of an affected used
12 motor vehicle to determine eligibility under this
13 subparagraph; provided, that the manner and method may
14 not be unduly burdensome and may not require
15 information that is unduly burdensome to provide. All
16 reimbursement claims made by new motor vehicle dealers
17 pursuant to this section for recall remedies or
18 repairs, or for compensation where no part or repair
19 is reasonably available and the vehicle is subject to
20 a stop-sale or do-not-drive order, shall be subject to
21 the same limitations and requirements as a warranty
22 reimbursement claim made under subparagraph b of this
23 paragraph. In the alternative, a manufacturer may
24 compensate its franchised new motor vehicle dealers
Req. No. 12302 Page 39
1 under a national recall compensation program;
2 provided, the compensation under the program is equal
3 to or greater than that provided under division (5) of
4 this subparagraph, or as the manufacturer and new
5 motor vehicle dealer otherwise agree. Nothing in this
6 section shall require a factory to provide total
7 compensation to a new motor vehicle dealer which would
8 exceed the total average Black Book value of the
9 affected used motor vehicle as originally determined
10 under division (5) of this subparagraph. Any remedy
11 provided to a new motor vehicle dealer under this
12 subparagraph is exclusive and may not be combined with
13 any other state or federal compensation remedy,
14 d. unreasonably fails or refuses to offer to its same
15 line-make franchised dealers a reasonable supply and
16 mix of all models manufactured for that line-make, or
17 unreasonably requires a dealer to pay any extra fee,
18 purchase unreasonable advertising displays or other
19 materials, or enter into a separate agreement which
20 adversely alters the rights or obligations contained
21 within the dealer's existing franchise agreement or
22 which waives any right of the new motor vehicle dealer
23 or new powersports vehicle dealer as protected by
24 Section 561 et seq. of this title, or remodel,
Req. No. 12302 Page 40
1 renovate, or recondition the dealer's existing
2 facilities as a prerequisite to receiving a model or
3 series of vehicles, except as may be necessary to sell
4 or service the model or series of vehicles as provided
5 by subparagraph e of this paragraph. It shall be a
6 violation of this section for new vehicle allocation
7 to be withheld subject to any requirement to purchase
8 or sell any number of used or off-lease vehicles. The
9 failure to deliver any such new motor vehicle shall
10 not be considered a violation of the section if the
11 failure is not arbitrary or is due to lack of
12 manufacturing capacity or to a strike or labor
13 difficulty, a shortage of materials, a freight
14 embargo, or other cause over which the manufacturer
15 has no control. However, this subparagraph shall not
16 apply to limited production model vehicles, a vehicle
17 not advertised by the factory for sale in this state,
18 vehicles that are subject to allocation affected by
19 federal environmental laws or environmental laws of
20 this state, or vehicles allocated in response to an
21 unforeseen event or circumstance,
22 e. except as necessary to comply with a health or safety
23 law, or to comply with a technology requirement which
24 is necessary to sell or service a vehicle that the
Req. No. 12302 Page 41
1 franchised new motor vehicle dealer or new powersports
2 vehicle dealer is authorized or licensed by the
3 franchisor to sell or service, requires a dealer to
4 construct a new facility or substantially renovate the
5 dealer's existing facility unless the facility
6 construction or renovation is justified by the
7 economic conditions existing at the time, as well as
8 the reasonably foreseeable projections, in the new
9 motor vehicle dealer's market and in the automotive
10 industry. However, this subparagraph shall not apply
11 if the new motor vehicle dealer or new powersports
12 vehicle dealer voluntarily agrees to facility
13 construction or renovation in exchange for money,
14 credit, allowance, reimbursement, or additional
15 vehicle allocation to a dealer from the factory to
16 compensate the dealer for the cost of, or a portion of
17 the cost of, the facility construction or renovation.
18 Except as necessary to comply with a health or safety
19 law, or to comply with a technology or safety
20 requirement which is necessary to sell or service a
21 motor vehicle or powersports vehicle that the
22 franchised dealer is authorized or licensed by the
23 franchisor to sell or service, a new vehicle dealer
24 which completes a facility construction or renovation
Req. No. 12302 Page 42
1 pursuant to factory requirements shall not be required
2 to construct a new facility or renovate the existing
3 facility if the same area of the facility or premises
4 has been constructed or substantially altered within
5 the last ten (10) years and the construction or
6 alteration was approved by the manufacturer as a part
7 of a facility upgrade program, standard, or policy.
8 For purposes of this subparagraph, "substantially
9 altered" means to perform an alteration that
10 substantially impacts the architectural features,
11 characteristics, or integrity of a structure or lot.
12 The term shall not include routine maintenance
13 reasonably necessary to maintain a dealership in
14 attractive condition. If a facility upgrade program,
15 standard, or policy under which the dealer completed a
16 facility construction or substantial alteration does
17 not contain a specific time period during which the
18 manufacturer or distributor shall provide payments or
19 benefits to a participating dealer, or the time frame
20 specified under the program is reduced or canceled
21 prematurely in the unilateral discretion of the
22 manufacturer or distributor, the manufacturer or
23 distributor shall not deny the participating dealer
24 any payment or benefit under the terms of the program,
Req. No. 12302 Page 43
1 standard, or policy as it existed when the dealer
2 began to perform under the program, standard, or
3 policy for the balance of the ten-year period,
4 regardless of whether the manufacturer's or
5 distributor's program, standard, or policy has been
6 changed or canceled, unless the manufacturer and
7 dealer agree, in writing, to the change in payment or
8 benefit,
9 f. requires a new motor vehicle dealer or new powersports
10 vehicle dealer to establish an exclusive facility,
11 unless supported by reasonable business, market, and
12 economic considerations; provided, that this section
13 shall not restrict the terms of any agreement for such
14 exclusive facility voluntarily entered into and
15 supported by valuable consideration separate from the
16 new motor vehicle dealer's right to sell and service
17 motor vehicles for the franchisor,
18 g. requires a new motor vehicle dealer or new powersports
19 vehicle dealer to enter into a site-control agreement
20 covering any or all of the new motor vehicle dealer's
21 facilities or premises; provided, that this section
22 shall not restrict the terms of any site-control
23 agreement voluntarily entered into and supported by
24 valuable consideration separate from the new motor
Req. No. 12302 Page 44
1 vehicle dealer's right to sell and service motor
2 vehicles for the franchisor. Notwithstanding the
3 foregoing or the terms of any site-control agreement,
4 a site-control agreement automatically extinguishes if
5 all of the factory's franchises that operated from the
6 location that are the subject of the site-control
7 agreement are terminated by the factory as part of the
8 discontinuance of a product line,
9 h. refuses to pay, or claims reimbursement from, a new
10 motor vehicle dealer or new powersports vehicle dealer
11 for sales, incentives, or other payments related to a
12 vehicle sold by the dealer because the purchaser of
13 the new vehicle exported or resold the vehicle in
14 violation of the policy of the factory unless the
15 factory can show that, at the time of the sale, the
16 new vehicle dealer knew or reasonably should have
17 known of the purchaser's intention to export or resell
18 the vehicle. There is a rebuttable presumption that
19 the new vehicle dealer did not know or could not have
20 known that the vehicle would be exported if the
21 vehicle is titled and registered in any state of the
22 United States, or
23 i. requires a new motor vehicle dealer or new powersports
24 vehicle dealer to purchase goods or services for the
Req. No. 12302 Page 45
1 construction, renovation, or improvement of the new
2 dealer's facility from a vendor chosen by the factory
3 if goods or services available from other sources are
4 of substantially similar quality and design and comply
5 with all applicable laws; provided, however, that such
6 goods are not subject to the factory's intellectual
7 property or trademark rights and the new vehicle
8 dealer has received the factory's approval, which
9 approval may not be unreasonably withheld. Nothing in
10 this subparagraph may be construed to allow a new
11 motor vehicle dealer or new powersports vehicle dealer
12 to impair or eliminate a factory's intellectual
13 property, trademark rights, or trade dress usage
14 guidelines. Nothing in this section prohibits the
15 enforcement of a voluntary agreement between the
16 factory and the new vehicle dealer where separate and
17 valuable consideration has been offered and accepted;
18 10. Being a factory that:
19 a. establishes a system of motor vehicle allocation or
20 distribution which is unfair, inequitable, or
21 unreasonably discriminatory. Upon the request of any
22 new motor vehicle dealer or new powersports vehicle
23 dealer franchised by it, a factory shall disclose in
24 writing to the dealer the basis upon which new
Req. No. 12302 Page 46
1 vehicles are allocated, scheduled, and delivered among
2 the new motor vehicle dealers of the same line-make
3 for that factory, or
4 b. changes an established plan or system of new motor
5 vehicle or new powersports vehicle distribution. A
6 new motor vehicle dealer or new powersports vehicle
7 dealer franchise agreement shall continue in full
8 force and operation notwithstanding a change, in whole
9 or in part, of an established plan or system of
10 distribution of the motor vehicles or new powersports
11 vehicles offered or previously offered for sale under
12 the franchise agreement. The appointment of a new
13 importer or distributor for motor vehicles or new
14 powersports vehicle offered for sale under the
15 franchise agreement shall be deemed to be a change of
16 an established plan or system of distribution. The
17 discontinuation of a line-make shall not be deemed to
18 be a change of an established plan or system of motor
19 vehicle or new powersports vehicle distribution. The
20 creation of a line-make shall not be deemed to be a
21 change of an established plan or system of motor
22 vehicle distribution as long as the new line-make is
23 not selling the same, or substantially the same
24 vehicle or vehicles previously sold through another
Req. No. 12302 Page 47
1 line-make by new motor vehicle dealers or new
2 powersports vehicle dealers with an active franchise
3 agreement for the other line-make in the state if such
4 dealers are no longer authorized to sell the
5 comparable vehicle previously sold through their line-
6 make. Changing a vehicle's powertrain is not
7 sufficient to show it is substantially different.
8 Upon the occurrence of such change, the manufacturer
9 or distributor shall be prohibited from obtaining a
10 license to distribute vehicles under the new plan or
11 system of distribution unless the manufacturer or
12 distributor offers to each vehicle dealer who is a
13 party to the franchise agreement a new franchise
14 agreement containing substantially the same provisions
15 which were contained in the previous franchise
16 agreement;
17 11. Being a factory that sells directly or indirectly new motor
18 vehicles or new powersports vehicles to any retail consumer in the
19 state except through a new motor vehicle dealer or new powersports
20 vehicle dealer holding a franchise for the line-make that includes
21 the new motor vehicle or new powersports vehicle. This paragraph
22 does not apply to factory sales of new vehicles to its employees,
23 family members of employees, retirees and family members of
24 retirees, not-for-profit organizations, or the federal, state, or
Req. No. 12302 Page 48
1 loca l governments. The provisions of this paragraph shall not
2 preclude a factory from providing information to a consumer for the
3 purpose of marketing or facilitating a sale of a new vehicle or from
4 establishing a program to sell or offer to sell new motor vehicles
5 or new powersports vehicle through participating dealers subject to
6 the limitations provided in paragraph 2 of Section 562 of this
7 title;
8 12. a. Being a factory which directly or indirectly:
9 (1) owns any ownership interest or has any financial

14 (2) operates or controls a new motor vehicle dealer
15 or new powersports vehicle dealer, or
16 (3) acts in the capacity of a new motor vehicle
17 dealer or new powersports vehicle dealer.
18 b. (1) This paragraph does not prohibit a factory from
19 owning or controlling a new motor vehicle dealer
20 or new powersports vehicle dealer while in a bona
21 fide relationship with a dealer development
22 candidate who has made a substantial initial
23 investment in the franchise and whose initial
24 investment is subject to potential loss. The
Req. No. 12302 Page 49
1 dealer development candidate can reasonably
2 expect to acquire full ownership of a new vehicle
3 dealer within a reasonable period of time not to
4 exceed ten (10) years and on reasonable terms and
5 conditions. The ten-year acquisition period may
6 be expanded for good cause shown.
7 (2) This paragraph does not prohibit a factory from
8 owning, operating, controlling, or acting in the
9 capacity of a new motor vehicle dealer or new
10 powersports vehicle dealer for a period not to
11 exceed twelve (12) months during the transition
12 from one independent dealer to another
13 independent dealer if the dealership is for sale
14 at a reasonable price and on reasonable terms and
15 conditions to an independent qualified buyer. On
16 showing by a factory of good cause, the Oklahoma
17 New Motor Vehicle Commission may extend the time
18 limit set forth above; extensions may be granted
19 for periods not to exceed twelve (12) months.
20 (3) This paragraph does not prohibit a factory from
21 owning, operating, or controlling or acting in
22 the capacity of a new motor vehicle dealer or new

2 owning, directly or indirectly, a minority
3 interest in an entity that owns, operates, or
4 controls motor vehicle dealerships or powersports
5 vehicle dealerships of the same line-make
6 franchised by the manufacturer, provided that

11 trade exclusively in the line-make of that
12 manufacturer,
13 (b) all of the franchise agreements of the
14 manufacturer confer rights on the dealer of
15 the line-make to develop and operate, within
16 a defined geographic territory or area, as
17 many dealership facilities as the dealer and
18 manufacturer shall agree are appropriate,
19 (c) at the time the manufacturer first acquires
20 an ownership interest or assumes operation,
21 the distance between any dealership thus
22 owned or operated and the nearest

10 and
11 (e) prior to January 1, 2000, the factory shall
12 have furnished or made available to
13 prospective new vehicle dealers an offering
14 circular in accordance with the Trade
15 Regulation Rule on Franchising of the

9 vehicle dealer;
10 14. Being a factory which does not provide or direct leads in a

Req. No. 12302 Page 53
1 forth in subparagraphs f and g of paragraph 9 of this
2 subsection,

6 submitted an accounting of those expenses within thirty (30) days of
7 receipt of the written request of the factory for such an
8 accounting. The accounting may be requested by a factory before

16 or dealerships which are subject to the factory's
17 right of first refusal. If purchasing dealer fails to
18 provide a written response within said thirty (30) day
19 timeframe, it shall be presumed that the purchasing
20 dealer is not willing to proceed with the transaction
21 subject to the factory's right of first refusal. The
22 selling dealer shall notify factory of the purchasing

7 consecutive days of nonwarranty consumer-paid service
8 repair orders which contain warranty-like repairs,
9 whichever is less, covering repairs made no more than
10 one hundred eighty (180) days before the submission
11 and declaring the average percentage labor rate and/or
12 markup rate. A motor vehicle dealer may not submit a
13 request to establish its retail rates more than once
14 in a twelve-month period. That request may establish
15 a parts markup rate, labor rate, or both. The new
16 motor vehicle dealer or new powersports vehicle dealer
17 shall calculate its retail parts rate by determining
18 the total charges for parts from the qualified repair
19 orders submitted, dividing that amount by the new
20 motor vehicle dealer's total cost of the purchase of
21 those parts, subtracting one (1), and multiplying by
22 one hundred (100) to produce a percentage. The new
23 motor vehicle dealer or new powersports vehicle dealer
24 shall calculate its retail labor rate by dividing the
Req. No. 12302 Page 30

1 amount of the new vehicle dealer's total labor sales
2 from the qualified repair orders by the total labor
3 hours charged for those sales. When submitting repair
4 orders to establish a retail parts and labor rate, a
5 new motor vehicle dealer or new powersports vehicle
6 dealer need not include repairs for:
7 (1) routine maintenance including but not limited to
8 the replacement of bulbs, fluids, filters,
9 batteries, and belts that are not provided in the
10 course of and related to a repair,
11 (2) factory special events, specials, or promotional
12 discounts for retail consumer repairs,
13 (3) parts sold or repairs performed at wholesale,
14 (4) factory-approved goodwill or policy repairs or
15 replacements,
16 (5) repairs with aftermarket parts, when calculating
17 the retail parts rate but not the retail labor
18 rate,
19 (6) repairs on aftermarket parts,
20 (7) replacement of or work on tires including front-
21 end alignments and wheel or tire rotations,
22 (8) repairs of vehicles owned by the new motor

24 or employee thereof at the time of the repair,
Req. No. 12302 Page 31

1 (9) vehicle reconditioning, or
2 (10) items that do not have individual part numbers
3 including, but not limited to, nuts, bolts, and
4 fasteners.
5 A manufacturer or distributor may, not later than
6 forty-five (45) days after submission, rebut that
7 declared retail parts and labor rate in writing by
8 reasonably substantiating that the rate is not
9 accurate or is incomplete pursuant to the provisions
10 of this section. If the manufacturer or distributor
11 determines the set of repair orders submitted by the
12 new motor vehicle dealer or new powersports vehicle
13 dealer pursuant to this section for a retail labor
14 rate or retail parts markup rate is substantially
15 higher than the new vehicle dealer's current warranty
16 rates, the manufacturer or distributor may request, in
17 writing, within forty-five (45) days after the
18 manufacturer's or distributor's receipt of the new
19 vehicle dealer's initial submission, all repair orders
20 closed within the period of thirty (30) days
21 immediately preceding, or thirty (30) days immediately
22 following, the set of repair orders initially
23 submitted by the new motor vehicle dealer. All time
24 periods under this section shall be suspended until
Req. No. 12302 Page 32

1 the supplemental repair orders are provided. If the
2 manufacturer or distributor requests supplemental
3 repair orders, the manufacturer or distributor may,
4 within thirty (30) days after receiving the
5 supplemental repair orders and in accordance with the
6 formula described in this subsection, calculate a
7 proposed adjusted retail labor rate or retail parts
8 markup rate, as applicable, based upon any set of the
9 qualified repair orders submitted by the franchisee
10 and following the formula set forth herein to
11 establish the rate. The retail labor and parts rates
12 shall go into effect thirty (30) days following the
13 approval by the manufacturer or distributor. If the
14 declared rate is rebutted, the manufacturer or
15 distributor shall provide written notice stating the
16 reasons for the rebuttal, an explanation of the
17 reasons for the rebuttal, and a copy of all
18 calculations used by the franchisor in determining the
19 manufacturer or distributor's position and propose an
20 adjustment in writing of the average percentage markup
21 or labor rate based on that rebuttal not later than
22 forty-five (45) days after submission. If the new
23 motor vehicle dealer or new powersports vehicle dealer
24 does not agree with the proposed average percentage
Req. No. 12302 Page 33

1 markup or labor rate, the new vehicle dealer may file
2 a protest with the Commission not later than thirty
3 (30) days after receipt of that proposal by the
4 manufacturer or distributor. In the event a protest
5 is filed, the manufacturer or distributor shall have
6 the burden of proof to establish the new vehicle
7 dealer's submitted parts markup rate or labor rate was
8 inaccurate or not complete pursuant to the provisions
9 of this section. A manufacturer or distributor may
10 not retaliate against any new motor vehicle dealer or
11 new powersports vehicle dealer seeking to exercise its
12 rights under this section. A manufacturer or
13 distributor may require a dealer to submit repair
14 orders in accordance with this section in order to
15 validate the reasonableness of a dealer's retail rate
16 for parts or labor not more often than once every
17 twelve (12) months. A manufacturer or distributor may
18 not otherwise recover its costs from new vehicle
19 dealers within this state including a surcharge
20 imposed on a new motor vehicle dealer solely intended
21 to recover the cost of reimbursing a dealer for parts
22 and labor pursuant to this section; provided, a
23 manufacturer or distributor shall not be prohibited
24 from increasing prices for vehicles or parts in the
Req. No. 12302 Page 34

1 normal course of business or from auditing and
2 charging back claims in accordance with this section.
3 All claims made by dealers for compensation for
4 delivery, preparation, warranty, or recall repair work
5 shall be paid within thirty (30) days after approval
6 and shall be approved or disapproved within thirty
7 (30) days after receipt. When any claim is
8 disapproved, the dealer shall be notified in writing
9 of the grounds for disapproval. The dealer's
10 delivery, preparation, and warranty obligations as
11 filed with the Commission shall constitute the
12 dealer's sole responsibility for product liability as
13 between the dealer and manufacturer. A factory may
14 reasonably and periodically audit a new motor vehicle
15 dealer or new powersports vehicle dealer to determine
16 the validity of paid claims for dealer compensation or
17 any charge-backs for warranty parts or service
18 compensation. Except in cases of suspected fraud,
19 audits of warranty payments shall only be for the one-
20 year period immediately following the date of the
21 payment. A manufacturer shall reserve the right to
22 reasonable, periodic audits to determine the validity
23 of paid claims for dealer compensation or any charge-
24 backs for consumer or dealer incentives. Except in
Req. No. 12302 Page 35

1 cases of suspected fraud, audits of incentive payments
2 shall only be for a one-year period immediately
3 following the date of the payment. A factory shall
4 not deny a claim or charge a new motor vehicle dealer
5 back subsequent to the payment of the claim unless the
6 factory can show that the claim was false or
7 fraudulent or that the new motor vehicle dealer or new
8 powersports vehicle dealer failed to reasonably
9 substantiate the claim by the written reasonable
10 procedures of the factory. A factory shall not deny a
11 claim or implement a charge-back against a new vehicle
12 dealer after payment of a claim in the event a
13 purchaser of a new vehicle that is the subject of a
14 claim fails to comply with titling or registration
15 laws of this state and is not prevented from
16 compliance by any action of the dealer; provided, that
17 the factory may require the dealer to provide, within
18 thirty (30) days of notice of charge-back, withholding
19 of payment, or denial of claim, the documentation to
20 demonstrate the vehicle sale, delivery, and customer
21 qualification for an incentive as reported, including
22 consumer name and address and written attestation
23 signed by the dealer operator or general manager
24 stating the consumer was not on the export control
Req. No. 12302 Page 36

1 list and the dealer did not know or have reason to
2 know the vehicle was being exported or resold.
3 The factory shall provide written notice to a dealer
4 of a proposed charge-back that is the result of an
5 audit along with the specific audit results and
6 proposed charge-back amount. A dealer that receives
7 notice of a proposed charge-back pursuant to a
8 factory's audit has the right to file a protest with
9 the Commission within thirty (30) days after receipt
10 of the notice of the charge-back or audit results,
11 whichever is later. The factory is prohibited from
12 implementing the charge-back or debiting the dealer's
13 account until either the time frame for filing a
14 protest has passed or a final adjudication is rendered
15 by the Commission, whichever is later, unless the
16 dealer has agreed to the charge-back or charge-backs,
17 c. fails to compensate the new motor vehicle dealer for a
18 used motor vehicle:
19 (1) that is of the same make and model manufactured,
20 imported, or distributed by the factory and is a
21 line-make that the new motor vehicle dealer is
22 franchised to sell or on which the new motor
23 vehicle dealer is authorized to perform recall
24 repairs,
Req. No. 12302 Page 37

1 (2) that is subject to a stop-sale or do-not-drive
2 order issued by the factory or an authorized
3 governmental agency,
4 (3) that is held by the new motor vehicle dealer in
5 the dealer's inventory at the time the stop-sale
6 or do-not-drive order is issued or that is taken
7 by the new motor vehicle dealer into the dealer's
8 inventory after the recall notice as a result of
9 a retail consumer trade-in or a lease return to
10 the dealer inventory in accordance with an
11 applicable lease contract,
12 (4) that cannot be repaired due to the
13 unavailability, within thirty (30) days after
14 issuance of the stop-sale or do-not-drive order,
15 of a remedy or parts necessary for the new motor
16 vehicle dealer to make the recall repair, and
17 (5) that is not at least in the prorated amount of
18 one percent (1.00%) of the value of the vehicle
19 per month beginning on the date that is thirty
20 (30) days after the date on which the stop-sale
21 order was provided to the new motor vehicle
22 dealer until the earlier of either of the
23 following:
24
Req. No. 12302 Page 38

1 (a) the date the recall remedy or parts are made
2 available, or
3 (b) the date the new motor vehicle dealer sells,
4 trades, or otherwise disposes of the
5 affected used motor vehicle.
6 For the purposes of division (5) of this subparagraph,
7 the value of a used vehicle shall be the average Black
8 Book value for the year, make, and model of the
9 recalled vehicle. A factory may direct the manner and
10 method in which a new motor vehicle dealer must
11 demonstrate the inventory status of an affected used
12 motor vehicle to determine eligibility under this
13 subparagraph; provided, that the manner and method may
14 not be unduly burdensome and may not require
15 information that is unduly burdensome to provide. All
16 reimbursement claims made by new motor vehicle dealers
17 pursuant to this section for recall remedies or
18 repairs, or for compensation where no part or repair
19 is reasonably available and the vehicle is subject to
20 a stop-sale or do-not-drive order, shall be subject to
21 the same limitations and requirements as a warranty
22 reimbursement claim made under subparagraph b of this
23 paragraph. In the alternative, a manufacturer may
24 compensate its franchised new motor vehicle dealers
Req. No. 12302 Page 39

1 under a national recall compensation program;
2 provided, the compensation under the program is equal
3 to or greater than that provided under division (5) of
4 this subparagraph, or as the manufacturer and new
5 motor vehicle dealer otherwise agree. Nothing in this
6 section shall require a factory to provide total
7 compensation to a new motor vehicle dealer which would
8 exceed the total average Black Book value of the
9 affected used motor vehicle as originally determined
10 under division (5) of this subparagraph. Any remedy
11 provided to a new motor vehicle dealer under this
12 subparagraph is exclusive and may not be combined with
13 any other state or federal compensation remedy,
14 d. unreasonably fails or refuses to offer to its same
15 line-make franchised dealers a reasonable supply and
16 mix of all models manufactured for that line-make, or
17 unreasonably requires a dealer to pay any extra fee,
18 purchase unreasonable advertising displays or other
19 materials, or enter into a separate agreement which
20 adversely alters the rights or obligations contained
21 within the dealer's existing franchise agreement or
22 which waives any right of the new motor vehicle dealer
23 or new powersports vehicle dealer as protected by
24 Section 561 et seq. of this title, or remodel,

1 renovate, or recondition the dealer's existing
2 facilities as a prerequisite to receiving a model or
3 series of vehicles, except as may be necessary to sell
4 or service the model or series of vehicles as provided
5 by subparagraph e of this paragraph. It shall be a
6 violation of this section for new vehicle allocation
7 to be withheld subject to any requirement to purchase
8 or sell any number of used or off-lease vehicles. The
9 failure to deliver any such new motor vehicle shall
10 not be considered a violation of the section if the
11 failure is not arbitrary or is due to lack of
12 manufacturing capacity or to a strike or labor
13 difficulty, a shortage of materials, a freight
14 embargo, or other cause over which the manufacturer
15 has no control. However, this subparagraph shall not
16 apply to limited production model vehicles, a vehicle
17 not advertised by the factory for sale in this state,
18 vehicles that are subject to allocation affected by
19 federal environmental laws or environmental laws of
20 this state, or vehicles allocated in response to an
21 unforeseen event or circumstance,
22 e. except as necessary to comply with a health or safety
23 law, or to comply with a technology requirement which
24 is necessary to sell or service a vehicle that the
Req. No. 12302 Page 41

1 franchised new motor vehicle dealer or new powersports
2 vehicle dealer is authorized or licensed by the
3 franchisor to sell or service, requires a dealer to
4 construct a new facility or substantially renovate the
5 dealer's existing facility unless the facility
6 construction or renovation is justified by the
7 economic conditions existing at the time, as well as
8 the reasonably foreseeable projections, in the new
9 motor vehicle dealer's market and in the automotive
10 industry. However, this subparagraph shall not apply
11 if the new motor vehicle dealer or new powersports
12 vehicle dealer voluntarily agrees to facility
13 construction or renovation in exchange for money,
14 credit, allowance, reimbursement, or additional
15 vehicle allocation to a dealer from the factory to
16 compensate the dealer for the cost of, or a portion of
17 the cost of, the facility construction or renovation.
18 Except as necessary to comply with a health or safety
19 law, or to comply with a technology or safety
20 requirement which is necessary to sell or service a
21 motor vehicle or powersports vehicle that the
22 franchised dealer is authorized or licensed by the
23 franchisor to sell or service, a new vehicle dealer
24 which completes a facility construction or renovation
Req. No. 12302 Page 42

1 pursuant to factory requirements shall not be required
2 to construct a new facility or renovate the existing
3 facility if the same area of the facility or premises
4 has been constructed or substantially altered within
5 the last ten (10) years and the construction or
6 alteration was approved by the manufacturer as a part
7 of a facility upgrade program, standard, or policy.
8 For purposes of this subparagraph, "substantially
9 altered" means to perform an alteration that
10 substantially impacts the architectural features,
11 characteristics, or integrity of a structure or lot.
12 The term shall not include routine maintenance
13 reasonably necessary to maintain a dealership in
14 attractive condition. If a facility upgrade program,
15 standard, or policy under which the dealer completed a
16 facility construction or substantial alteration does
17 not contain a specific time period during which the
18 manufacturer or distributor shall provide payments or
19 benefits to a participating dealer, or the time frame
20 specified under the program is reduced or canceled
21 prematurely in the unilateral discretion of the
22 manufacturer or distributor, the manufacturer or
23 distributor shall not deny the participating dealer
24 any payment or benefit under the terms of the program,

1 standard, or policy as it existed when the dealer
2 began to perform under the program, standard, or
3 policy for the balance of the ten-year period,

9 f. requires a new motor vehicle dealer or new powersports
10 vehicle dealer to establish an exclusive facility,
11 unless supported by reasonable business, market, and
12 economic considerations; provided, that this section
13 shall not restrict the terms of any agreement for such
14 exclusive facility voluntarily entered into and
15 supported by valuable consideration separate from the
16 new motor vehicle dealer's right to sell and service
17 motor vehicles for the franchisor,
18 g. requires a new motor vehicle dealer or new powersports
19 vehicle dealer to enter into a site-control agreement
20 covering any or all of the new motor vehicle dealer's
21 facilities or premises; provided, that this section
22 shall not restrict the terms of any site-control
23 agreement voluntarily entered into and supported by
24 valuable consideration separate from the new motor
Req. No. 12302 Page 44

1 vehicle dealer's right to sell and service motor
2 vehicles for the franchisor. Notwithstanding the
3 foregoing or the terms of any site-control agreement,
4 a site-control agreement automatically extinguishes if
5 all of the factory's franchises that operated from the
6 location that are the subject of the site-control
7 agreement are terminated by the factory as part of the
8 discontinuance of a product line,
9 h. refuses to pay, or claims reimbursement from, a new
10 motor vehicle dealer or new powersports vehicle dealer
11 for sales, incentives, or other payments related to a
12 vehicle sold by the dealer because the purchaser of
13 the new vehicle exported or resold the vehicle in
14 violation of the policy of the factory unless the
15 factory can show that, at the time of the sale, the
16 new vehicle dealer knew or reasonably should have
17 known of the purchaser's intention to export or resell
18 the vehicle. There is a rebuttable presumption that
19 the new vehicle dealer did not know or could not have
20 known that the vehicle would be exported if the
21 vehicle is titled and registered in any state of the
22 United States, or
23 i. requires a new motor vehicle dealer or new powersports
24 vehicle dealer to purchase goods or services for the
Req. No. 12302 Page 45

1 construction, renovation, or improvement of the new
2 dealer's facility from a vendor chosen by the factory
3 if goods or services available from other sources are
4 of substantially similar quality and design and comply
5 with all applicable laws; provided, however, that such
6 goods are not subject to the factory's intellectual
7 property or trademark rights and the new vehicle
8 dealer has received the factory's approval, which
9 approval may not be unreasonably withheld. Nothing in
10 this subparagraph may be construed to allow a new
11 motor vehicle dealer or new powersports vehicle dealer
12 to impair or eliminate a factory's intellectual
13 property, trademark rights, or trade dress usage
14 guidelines. Nothing in this section prohibits the
15 enforcement of a voluntary agreement between the
16 factory and the new vehicle dealer where separate and
17 valuable consideration has been offered and accepted;
18 10. Being a factory that:
19 a. establishes a system of motor vehicle allocation or
20 distribution which is unfair, inequitable, or
21 unreasonably discriminatory. Upon the request of any
22 new motor vehicle dealer or new powersports vehicle

24 writing to the dealer the basis upon which new
Req. No. 12302 Page 46

1 vehicles are allocated, scheduled, and delivered among
2 the new motor vehicle dealers of the same line-make
3 for that factory, or
4 b. changes an established plan or system of new motor
5 vehicle or new powersports vehicle distribution. A
6 new motor vehicle dealer or new powersports vehicle
7 dealer franchise agreement shall continue in full
8 force and operation notwithstanding a change, in whole
9 or in part, of an established plan or system of
10 distribution of the motor vehicles or new powersports
11 vehicles offered or previously offered for sale under
12 the franchise agreement. The appointment of a new
13 importer or distributor for motor vehicles or new
14 powersports vehicle offered for sale under the
15 franchise agreement shall be deemed to be a change of
16 an established plan or system of distribution. The
17 discontinuation of a line-make shall not be deemed to
18 be a change of an established plan or system of motor
19 vehicle or new powersports vehicle distribution. The
20 creation of a line-make shall not be deemed to be a
21 change of an established plan or system of motor
22 vehicle distribution as long as the new line-make is
23 not selling the same, or substantially the same
24 vehicle or vehicles previously sold through another
Req. No. 12302 Page 47

1 line-make by new motor vehicle dealers or new
2 powersports vehicle dealers with an active franchise
3 agreement for the other line-make in the state if such
4 dealers are no longer authorized to sell the
5 comparable vehicle previously sold through their line-
6 make. Changing a vehicle's powertrain is not
7 sufficient to show it is substantially different.
8 Upon the occurrence of such change, the manufacturer
9 or distributor shall be prohibited from obtaining a
10 license to distribute vehicles under the new plan or
11 system of distribution unless the manufacturer or
12 distributor offers to each vehicle dealer who is a
13 party to the franchise agreement a new franchise
14 agreement containing substantially the same provisions
15 which were contained in the previous franchise
16 agreement;
17 11. Being a factory that sells directly or indirectly new motor
18 vehicles or new powersports vehicles to any retail consumer in the
19 state except through a new motor vehicle dealer or new powersports
20 vehicle dealer holding a franchise for the line-make that includes
21 the new motor vehicle or new powersports vehicle. This paragraph
22 does not apply to factory sales of new vehicles to its employees,
23 family members of employees, retirees and family members of
24 retirees, not-for-profit organizations, or the federal, state, or
Req. No. 12302 Page 48

1 loca l governments. The provisions of this paragraph shall not
2 preclude a factory from providing information to a consumer for the
3 purpose of marketing or facilitating a sale of a new vehicle or from
4 establishing a program to sell or offer to sell new motor vehicles
5 or new powersports vehicle through participating dealers subject to
6 the limitations provided in paragraph 2 of Section 562 of this
7 title;
8 12. a. Being a factory which directly or indirectly:

15 or new powersports vehicle dealer, or
16 (3) acts in the capacity of a new motor vehicle
17 dealer or new powersports vehicle dealer.
18 b. (1) This paragraph does not prohibit a factory from
19 owning or controlling a new motor vehicle dealer
20 or new powersports vehicle dealer while in a bona
21 fide relationship with a dealer development
22 candidate who has made a substantial initial
23 investment in the franchise and whose initial
24 investment is subject to potential loss. The
Req. No. 12302 Page 49

1 dealer development candidate can reasonably
2 expect to acquire full ownership of a new vehicle
3 dealer within a reasonable period of time not to
4 exceed ten (10) years and on reasonable terms and
5 conditions. The ten-year acquisition period may
6 be expanded for good cause shown.
7 (2) This paragraph does not prohibit a factory from
8 owning, operating, controlling, or acting in the
9 capacity of a new motor vehicle dealer or new
10 powersports vehicle dealer for a period not to
11 exceed twelve (12) months during the transition
12 from one independent dealer to another
13 independent dealer if the dealership is for sale
14 at a reasonable price and on reasonable terms and
15 conditions to an independent qualified buyer. On
16 showing by a factory of good cause, the Oklahoma
17 New Motor Vehicle Commission may extend the time
18 limit set forth above; extensions may be granted
19 for periods not to exceed twelve (12) months.
20 (3) This paragraph does not prohibit a factory from
21 owning, operating, or controlling or acting in
22 the capacity of a new motor vehicle dealer or new

13 (b) all of the franchise agreements of the
14 manufacturer confer rights on the dealer of
15 the line-make to develop and operate, within
16 a defined geographic territory or area, as
17 many dealership facilities as the dealer and
18 manufacturer shall agree are appropriate,
19 (c) at the time the manufacturer first acquires
20 an ownership interest or assumes operation,

12 have furnished or made available to
13 prospective new vehicle dealers an offering
14 circular in accordance with the Trade
15 Regulation Rule on Franchising of the

6 submitted an accounting of those expenses within thirty (30) days of
7 receipt of the written request of the factory for such an
8 accounting. The accounting may be requested by a factory before

18 provide a written response within said thirty (30) day
19 timeframe, it shall be presumed that the purchasing
20 dealer is not willing to proceed with the transaction
21 subject to the factory's right of first refusal. The
