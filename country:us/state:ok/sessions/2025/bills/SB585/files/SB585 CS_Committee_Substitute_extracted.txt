7 as to the amount and the fact that it is irrevocable until the
8 matter is finally resolved;
9 3. The right of the claimant to have this claim satisfied from
10 the deposit if the claimant is successful on the claim; and
11 4. The notice and hearing opportunities in accordance with the
12 tribe’s tort law, if any, otherwise in accordance with principles of
13 due process, which will be afforded to the claimant so that the
14 intent of this Compact to provide claimants with a meaningful
15 opportunity to seek a just remedy under fair conditions will be
16 fulfilled.

20 responsibilities, the tribe shall require the enterprise do the
21 following:
22 1. Operate the conduct of covered games in compliance with this
23 Compact, including, but not limited to, the standards and the
24 tribe’s rules and regulations;
Req. No. 1592 Page 41
1 2. Take reasonable measures to assure the physical safety of
2 enterprise patrons and personnel, prevent illegal activity at the
3 facility, and protect any rights of patrons under the Indian Civil
4 Rights Act of 1968, 25 U.S.C., Sec. 1302-1303 Sections 1302 through
5 1303;
6 3. Promptly notify appropriate law enforcement authorities of
7 persons who may be involved in illegal acts in accordance with
8 applicable law;
9 4. Assure that the construction and maintenance of the facility
10 meets or exceeds federal and tribal standards for comparable

12 5. Prepare adequate emergency access plans to ensure the health
13 and safety of all covered game patrons. Upon the finalization of
14 emergency access plans, the TCA or enterprise shall forward copies
15 of such plans to the SCA.
16 B. All licenses for members and employees of the TCA shall be
17 issued according to the same standards and terms applicable to
18 facility employees. The TCA shall employ qualified compliance
19 officers under the authority of the TCA. The compliance officers
20 shall be independent of the enterprise, and shall be supervised and
21 accountable only to the TCA. A TCA compliance officer shall be
22 available to the facility during all hours of operation upon
23 reasonable notice, and shall have immediate access to any and all
24 areas of the facility for the purpose of ensuring compliance with
Req. No. 1592 Page 42
1 the provisions of this Compact. The TCA shall investigate any such
2 suspected or reported violation of this Compact and shall require
3 the enterprise to correct such violations. The TCA shall officially
4 enter into its files timely written reports of investigations and
5 any action taken thereon, and shall forward copies of such reports
6 to the SCA within fifteen (15) days of such filing. Any such
7 violations shall be reported immediately to the TCA, and the TCA
8 shall immediately forward the same to the SCA. In addition, the TCA
9 shall promptly report to the SCA any such violations which it
10 independently discovers.
11 C. In order to develop and foster a positive and effective
12 relationship in the enforcement of the provisions of this Compact,
13 representatives of the TCA and the SCA shall meet, not less than on
14 an annual basis, to review past practices and examine methods to
15 improve the regulatory scheme created by this Compact. The meetings
16 shall take place at a location mutually agreed to by the TCA and the
17 SCA. The SCA, prior to or during such meetings, shall disclose to
18 the TCA any concerns, suspected activities, or pending matters
19 reasonably believed to possibly constitute violations of this
20 Compact by any person, organization or entity, if such disclosure
21 will not compromise the interest sought to be protected.
22 Part 8. STATE MONITORING OF COMPACT
23 A. The SCA shall, pursuant to the provisions of this Compact,
24 have the authority to monitor the conduct of covered games to ensure
Req. No. 1592 Page 43
1 that the covered games are conducted in compliance with the
2 provisions of this Compact. In order to properly monitor the
3 conduct of covered games, agents of the SCA shall have reasonable
4 access to all areas of the facility related to the conduct of
5 covered games as provided herein:
6 1. Access to the facility by the SCA shall be during the
7 facility’s normal operating hours only; provided that to the extent
8 such inspections are limited to areas of the facility where the
9 public is normally permitted, SCA agents may inspect the facility
10 without giving prior notice to the enterprise;
11 2. Any suspected or claimed violations of this Compact or of
12 law shall be directed in writing to the TCA; SCA agents shall not
13 interfere with the functioning of the enterprise; and
14 3. Before SCA agents enter any nonpublic area of the facility,
15 they shall provide proper photographic identification to the TCA.
16 SCA agents shall be accompanied in nonpublic areas of the facility
17 by a TCA agent. A one-hour notice by SCA to the TCA may be required
18 to assure that a TCA officer is available to accompany SCA agents at
19 all times.
20 B. Subject to the provisions herein, agents of the SCA shall
21 have the right to review and copy documents of the enterprise
22 related to its conduct of covered games. The review and copying of
23 such documents shall be during normal business hours or hours
24 otherwise at tribe’s discretion. However, the SCA shall not be
Req. No. 1592 Page 44
1 perm itted to copy those portions of any documents of the enterprise
2 related to its conduct of covered games that contain business or
3 marketing strategies or other proprietary and confidential
4 information of the enterprise, including, but not limited to,
5 customer lists, business plans, advertising programs, marketing
6 studies, and customer demographics or profiles. No documents of the
7 enterprise related to its conduct of covered games or copies thereof
8 shall be released to the public by the state under any
9 circumstances. All such documents shall be deemed confidential
10 documents owned by the tribe and shall not be subject to public
11 release by the state.
12 C. At the completion of any SCA inspection or investigation,
13 the SCA shall forward a written report thereof to the TCA. The TCA
14 shall be apprised on a timely basis of all pertinent,
15 nonconfidential information regarding any violation of federal,
16 state, or tribal laws, the rules or regulations, or this Compact.
17 Nothing herein prevents the SCA from contacting tribal or federal
18 law enforcement authorities for suspected criminal wrongdoing
19 involving the TCA. TCA may interview SCA inspectors upon reasonable
20 notice and examine work papers and SCA in the same fashion that SCA
21 inspectors may examine auditors’ notes and make auditor inquiry
22 unless providing such information to the TCA will compromise the
23 interests sought to be protected. If the SCA determines that
24 providing the information to the TCA will compromise the interests
Req. No. 1592 Page 45
1 soug ht to be protected, then the SCA shall provide such information
2 to the tribe in accordance with Part 13 14 of this Compact.
3 D. Nothing in this Compact shall be deemed to authorize the
4 state to regulate the tribe’s government, including the TCA, or to
5 interfere in any way with the tribe’s selection of its governmental
6 officers, including members of the TCA; provided, however, the SCA
7 and the tribe, upon request of the tribe, shall jointly employ, at
8 the tribe’s expense, an independent firm to perform on behalf of the
9 SCA the duties set forth in subsections A and B of this Part.
10 Part 9. JURISDICTION
11 This Compact shall not alter tribal, federal or state civil
12 adjudicatory or criminal jurisdiction.
13 Part 10. LICENSING
14 A. 1. Except as provided in paragraph 6 of Part 3 of this
15 Compact, no covered game employee shall be employed at a facility or
16 by an enterprise unless such person is licensed in accordance with
17 this Compact. In addition to the provisions of this Part which are
18 applicable to the licensing of all covered game employees, the
19 requirements of 25 C.F.R., Part 556, Background Investigations for
20 Primary Management Officials and Key Employees, and 25 C.F.R., Part
21 558, Gaming Licenses for Key Employees and Primary Management
22 Officials, apply to Key Employees and Primary Management Officials
23 of the facility and enterprise.
24
Req. No. 1592 Page 46
1 2. All prospective covered game employees shall apply to the
2 TCA for a license. Licenses shall be issued for periods of no more
3 than two (2) years, after which they may be renewed only following
4 review and update of the information upon which the license was
5 based; provided, the TCA may extend the period in which the license
6 is valid for a reasonable time pending the outcome of any
7 investigation being conducted in connection with the renewal of such
8 license. In the event the SCA contends that any such extension is
9 unreasonable, it may seek resolution of that issue pursuant to Part
10 11 12 of this Compact.
11 3. The application process shall require the TCA to obtain
12 sufficient information and identification from the applicant to
13 permit a background investigation to determine if a license should
14 be issued in accordance with this Part and the rules and
15 regulations. The TCA shall obtain information about a prospective
16 covered game employee that includes:
17 a. full name, including any aliases by which applicant
18 has ever been known,
19 b. social security number,
20 c. date and place of birth,

9 k. military service history, and
10 l. any other information the TCA determines is necessary
11 to conduct a thorough background investigation.
12 4. Upon obtaining the required initial information from a
13 prospective covered game employee, the TCA shall forward a copy of
14 such information to the SCA, along with any determinations made with
15 respect to the issuance or denial of a temporary or permanent
16 license. The SCA may conduct its own background investigation of
17 the applicant at SCA expense, shall notify the TCA of such
18 investigation within a reasonable time from initiation of the
19 investigation, and shall provide a written report to the TCA of the
20 outcome of such investigation within a reasonable time from the
21 receipt of a request from the TCA for such information. SCA
22 inspector field notes and the SCA inspector shall be available upon
23 reasonable notice for TCA review and inquiry.
24
Req. No. 1592 Page 48
1 5. The TCA may issue a temporary license for a period not to
2 exceed ninety (90) days, and the enterprise may employ on a
3 probationary basis, any prospective covered game employee who
4 represents in writing that he or she meets the standards set forth
5 in this Part, provided the TCA or enterprise is not in possession of
6 information to the contrary. The temporary license shall expire at
7 the end of the ninety-day period or upon issuance or denial of a
8 permanent license, whichever event occurs first. Provided that the
9 temporary license period may be extended at the discretion of the
10 TCA so long as good faith efforts are being made by the applicant to
11 provide required information, or the TCA is continuing to conduct
12 its investigation or is waiting on information from others, and
13 provided further that in the course of such temporary or extended
14 temporary licensing period, no information has come to the attention
15 of the TCA which, in the absence of countervailing information then
16 in the record, would otherwise require denial of license. A
17 permanent license shall be issued or denied within a reasonable time
18 following the completion of the applicant’s background
19 investigation.
20 6. In covered gaming the tribe shall not employ and shall
21 terminate, and the TCA shall not license and shall revoke a license
22 previously issued to, any covered game employee who:
23 a. has been convicted of any felony or an offense related
24 to any covered games or other gaming activity,
Req. No. 1592 Page 49
1 b. has knowingly and willfully provided false material,
2 statements or information on his or her employment
3 application, or
4 c. is a person whose prior activities, criminal record,
5 or reputation, habits, and associations pose a threat
6 to the public interest or to the effective regulation
7 and control of the conduct of covered games, or create
8 or enhance the dangers of unsuitable, unfair, or
9 illegal practices, methods, and activities in the
10 conduct of covered games or the carrying on of the
11 business and financial arrangements incidental
12 thereto.
13 7. The SCA may object to the employment of any individual by
14 the enterprise based upon the criteria set forth in paragraph 6 of
15 this subsection A of this Part. Such objection shall be in writing
16 setting forth the basis of the objection. The SCA inspector’s work
17 papers, notes and exhibits which formed the SCA conclusion shall be
18 available upon reasonable notice for TCA review. The enterprise
19 shall have discretion to employ an individual over the objection of
20 the SCA.
21 8. The TCA shall have the discretion to initiate or continue a
22 background investigation of any licensee or license applicant and to
23 take appropriate action with respect to the issuance or continued
24
Req. No. 1592 Page 50
1 vali dity of any license at any time, including suspending or
2 revoking such license.
3 9. The TCA shall require all covered game employees to wear, in
4 plain view, identification cards issued by the TCA which include a
5 photograph of the employee, his or her first name, a four-digit
6 identification number unique to the license issued to the employee,
7 a tribal seal or signature verifying official issuance of the card,
8 and a date of expiration, which shall not extend beyond such
9 employee’s license expiration date.
10 B. 1. Any person or entity who, directly or indirectly,
11 provides or is likely to provide at least Twenty-five Thousand
12 Dollars ($25,000.00) in goods or services to the enterprise in any
13 twelve-month period, or who has received at least Twenty-five
14 Thousand Dollars ($25,000.00) for goods or services provided to the
15 enterprise in any consecutive twelve-month period within the
16 immediately preceding twenty-four-month period, or any person or
17 entity who provides through sale, lease, rental or otherwise covered
18 games, or parts, maintenance or service in connection therewith to
19 the tribe or the enterprise at any time and in any amount, shall be
20 licensed by the TCA prior to the provision thereof. Provided, that
21 attorneys or certified public accountants and their firms shall be
22 exempt from the licensing requirement herein to the extent that they
23 are providing services covered by their professional licenses.
24
Req. No. 1592 Page 51
1 2. Background investigations and licensing shall follow the
2 same process and apply the same criteria as for covered game
3 employees set forth in paragraph 6 of subsection A of this Part.
4 3. In the case of a license application of any entity, all
5 principals thereof shall be subjected to the same background
6 investigation required for the licensing of a covered game employee,
7 but no license as such need be issued; provided, no license shall be
8 issued to the entity if the TCA determines that one or more of its
9 principals will be persons who would not be qualified to receive a
10 license if they applied as covered game employees.
11 4. Nothing herein shall prohibit the TCA from processing and
12 issuing a license to a principal in his or her own name.
13 5. Licenses issued under this subsection shall be reviewed at
14 least every two (2) years for continuing compliance, and shall be
15 promptly revoked if the licensee is determined to be in violation of
16 the standards set forth in paragraph 6 of subsection A of this Part.
17 In connection with such a review, the TCA shall require the person
18 or entity to update all information provided in the previous
19 application.
20 6. The enterprise shall not enter into, or continue to make
21 payments pursuant to, any contract or agreement for the provision of
22 goods or services with any person or entity who does not meet the
23 requirements of this Part including, but not limited to, any person
24
Req. No. 1592 Page 52
1 or e ntity whose application to the TCA for a license has been
2 denied, or whose license has expired or been suspended or revoked.
3 7. Pursuant to 25 C.F.R., Part 533, all management contracts
4 must be approved by the Chair of the National Indian Gaming
5 Commission. The SCA shall be notified promptly after any such
6 approval.
7 8. In addition to any licensing criteria set forth above, if
8 any person or entity seeking licensing under this subsection is to
9 receive any fee or other payment based on the revenues or profits of
10 the enterprise, the TCA may take into account whether or not such
11 fee or other payment is fair in light of market conditions and
12 practices.
13 C. 1. Subject to the exceptions set forth in paragraph 4 of
14 this subsection, any person or entity extending financing, directly
15 or indirectly, to the facility or enterprise in excess of Fifty
16 Thousand Dollars ($50,000.00) in any twelve-month period shall be
17 licensed prior to providing such financing. Principals thereof
18 shall be subjected to background investigations and determinations
19 in accordance with the procedures and standards set forth in
20 subsection A of this Part. Licenses issued under this section shall
21 be reviewed at least every two (2) years for continuing compliance,
22 and shall be promptly revoked if the licensee is determined to be in
23 violation of the standards set forth in paragraph 6 of subsection A
24 of this Part. In connection with such a review, the TCA shall
Req. No. 1592 Page 53
1 requ ire the person or entity to update all information provided in
2 the previous application.
3 2. The SCA shall be notified of all financing and loan
4 transactions with respect to covered games or supplies in which the

6 month period, and shall be entitled to review copies of all
7 agreements and documents in connection therewith.
8 3. A supplier of goods or services who provides financing

17 including, but not limited to, an institutional investor who, alone
18 or in conjunction with others, lends money through publicly or
19 commercially traded bonds or other commercially traded instruments,
20 including but not limited to the holders of such bonds or

7 license by such person or entity, it may notify the TCA of its
8 objection. The notice shall set forth the basis of the objection

15 Part 11. EXCLUSIVITY AND FEES
16 A. The parties acknowledge and recognize that this Compact
17 provides tribes with substantial exclusivity and, consistent with
18 the goals of IGRA, special opportunities for tribal economic
19 opportunity through gaming within the external boundaries of
20 Oklahoma in respect to the covered games. In consideration thereof,
21 so long as the state does not change its laws after the effective
22 date of this Compact to permit the operation of any additional form
23 of gaming by any such organization licensee, or change its laws to
24
Req. No. 1592 Page 55
1 perm it any additional electronic or machine gaming within Oklahoma,
2 the tribe agrees to pay the following fees:
3 1. The tribe covenants and agrees to pay to the state a fee
4 derived from covered game revenues calculated as set forth in
5 paragraph 2 of this subsection. Such fee shall be paid no later
6 than the twentieth day of the month for revenues received by the
7 tribe in the preceding month; and
8 2. The fee shall be:
9 a. four percent (4%) of the first Ten Million Dollars
10 ($10,000,000.00) of adjusted gross revenues received
11 by a tribe in a calendar year from the play of
12 electronic amusement games, electronic bonanza-style
13 bingo games and electronic instant bingo games,

15 ($10,000,000.00) of adjusted gross revenues received
16 by a tribe in a calendar year from the play of
17 electronic amusement games, electronic bonanza-style
18 bingo games and electronic instant bingo games,
19 c. six percent (6%) of all subsequent adjusted gross
20 revenues received by a tribe in a calendar year from
21 the play of electronic amusement games, electronic
22 bonanza-style bingo games and electronic instant bingo
23 games, and
24
Req. No. 1592 Page 56
1 d. ten percent (10%) of the monthly net win of the common
2 pool(s) or pot(s) from which prizes are paid for
3 nonhouse-banked card games. The tribe is entitled to
4 keep an amount equal to state payments from the common
5 pool(s) or pot(s) as part of its cost of operating the
6 games.
7 Payments of such fees shall be made to the Treasurer of the
8 State of Oklahoma. Nothing Except as provided in Section 4 of this
9 act, nothing herein shall require the allocation of such fees to
10 particular state purposes, including, but not limited to, the actual
11 costs of performing the state’s regulatory responsibilities
12 hereunder.
13 B. Annual oversight assessment. In addition to the fee
14 provided for in subsection A of this Part, the state shall be
15 entitled to payment for its costs incurred in connection with the
16 oversight of covered games to the extent provided herein, “annual
17 oversight assessment”. The annual oversight assessment, which shall
18 be Thirty-five Thousand Dollars ($35,000.00), shall be determined
19 and paid in advance on a fiscal year basis for each twelve (12)
20 months ending on June 30 of each year.
21 C. Upon the effective date of this Compact, the tribe shall

23 (“start-up assessment”). The purpose of the start-up assessment
24 shall be to assist the state in initiating its administrative and
Req. No. 1592 Page 57
1 over sight responsibilities hereunder and shall be a one-time payment
2 to the state for such purposes.
3 D. Nothing in this Compact shall be deemed to authorize the
4 state to impose any tax, fee, charge or assessment upon the tribe or
5 enterprise except as expressly authorized pursuant to this Compact;
6 provided that, to the extent that the tribe is required under
7 federal law to report prizes awarded, the tribe agrees to copy such
8 reports to the SCA.
9 E. In consideration for the covenants and agreements contained
10 herein, the state agrees that it will not, during the term of this
11 Compact, permit the nontribal operation of any machines or devices
12 to play covered games or electronic or mechanical gaming devices
13 otherwise presently prohibited by law within the state in excess of
14 the number and outside of the designated locations authorized by the
15 State-Tribal Gaming Act. The state recognizes the importance of
16 this provision to the tribe and agrees, in the event of a breach of
17 this provision by the state, to require any nontribal entity which
18 operates any such devices or machines in excess of such number or
19 outside of the designated location to remit to the state at least
20 quarterly no less than fifty percent (50%) of any increase in the
21 entities’ adjusted gross revenues following the addition of such
22 excess machines. The state further agrees to remit at least
23 quarterly to eligible tribes, as liquidated damages, a sum equal to
24 fifty percent (50%) of any increase in the entities’ adjusted gross
Req. No. 1592 Page 58
1 reve nues following the addition of such excess machines. For
2 purposes of this Part, “eligible tribes” means those tribes which
3 have entered into this Compact and are operating gaming pursuant to
4 this Compact within forty-five (45) miles of an entity which is
5 operating covered game machines in excess of the number authorized
6 by, or outside of the location designated by, the State-Tribal
7 Gaming Act. Such liquidated damages shall be allocated pro rata to
8 eligible tribes based on the number of covered game machines
9 operated by each Eligible Tribe in the time period when such
10 adjusted gross revenues were generated.
11 F. In consideration for the covenants and agreements contained
12 herein, the tribe agrees that in the event it has currently or
13 locates in the future a facility within a radius of twenty (20)
14 miles from a recipient licensee as that term is defined in
15 subsection K of Section 263 of this title that it shall comply with
16 the requirements of subsection K of Section 263 of this title.
17 Part 12. DISPUTE RESOLUTION
18 In the event that either party to this Compact believes that the
19 other party has failed to comply with any requirement of this
20 Compact, or in the event of any dispute hereunder, including, but
21 not limited to, a dispute over the proper interpretation of the
22 terms and conditions of this Compact, the following procedures may
23 be invoked:
24
Req. No. 1592 Page 59
1 1. The goal of the parties shall be to resolve all disputes
2 amicably and voluntarily whenever possible. A party asserting
3 noncompliance or seeking an interpretation of this Compact first
4 shall serve written notice on the other party. The notice shall
5 identify the specific Compact provision alleged to have been
6 violated or in dispute and shall specify in detail the asserting
7 party’s contention and any factual basis for the claim.
8 Representatives of the tribe and state shall meet within thirty (30)
9 days of receipt of notice in an effort to resolve the dispute;
10 2. Subject to the limitation set forth in paragraph 3 of this
11 Part, either party may refer a dispute arising under this Compact to
12 arbitration under the rules of the American Arbitration Association
13 (AAA), subject to enforcement or pursuant to review as provided by
14 paragraph 3 of this Part by a federal district court. The remedies
15 available through arbitration are limited to enforcement of the
16 provisions of this Compact. The parties consent to the jurisdiction
17 of such arbitration forum and court for such limited purposes and no
18 other, and each waives immunity with respect thereto. One
19 arbitrator shall be chosen by the parties from a list of qualified
20 arbitrators to be provided by the AAA. If the parties cannot agree
21 on an arbitrator, then the arbitrator shall be named by the AAA.
22 The expenses of arbitration shall be borne equally by the parties.
23 A party asserting noncompliance or seeking an interpretation of
24 this Compact under this section shall be deemed to have certified
Req. No. 1592 Page 60
1 that to the best of the party’s knowledge, information, and belief
2 formed after reasonable inquiry, the claim of noncompliance or the
3 request for interpretation of this Compact is warranted and made in
4 good faith and not for any improper purpose, such as to harass or to
5 cause unnecessary delay or the needless incurring of the cost of
6 resolving the dispute. If the dispute is found to have been
7 initiated in violation of this Part, the Arbitrator, upon request or
8 upon his or her own initiative, shall impose upon the violating
9 party an appropriate sanction, which may include an award to the
10 other party of its reasonable expenses incurred in having to
11 participate in the arbitration; and
12 3. Notwithstanding any provision of law, either party to the
13 Compact may bring an action against the other in a federal district
14 court for the de novo review of any arbitration award under
15 paragraph 2 of this Part. The decision of the court shall be
16 subject to appeal. Each of the parties hereto waives immunity and
17 consents to suit therein for such limited purposes, and agrees not
18 to raise the Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution or
19 comparable defense to the validity of such waiver.
20 Nothing herein shall be construed to authorize a money judgment

14 the patron, and
15 b. the claim of such other party would have been subject
16 to a consent to suit hereunder if it had been made by
17 the claimant directly; and
18 2. For prize claims, consent is granted only to the extent such
19 claim does not exceed the prize limit. Under no circumstances shall
20 any award exceed the prize limit. This consent shall only extend to
21 the patron actually claiming to have engaged in the play of a
22 covered game on which the claim is based. Prize claims shall not be
23 assignable. In the event any assignment of the prize claim is made,
24 or any person other than the claimant entitled to make the claim
Req. No. 1592 Page 39

1 beco mes a party to any action hereunder, this consent shall be
2 deemed revoked for all purposes. Notwithstanding the foregoing,

14 the patron, and
15 b. the claim of such other party would have been subject
16 to a consent to suit hereunder if it had been made by
17 the claimant directly.
18 D. Remedies in the Event of No or Inadequate Insurance for Tort
19 Claim. In the event a tort claim is made and there is no, or
20 inadequate, insurance in effect as required under this Compact, the
21 enterprise shall be deemed to be in default hereunder unless, within
22 ten (10) days of a demand by the SCA or a claimant to do so, the
23 enterprise has posted in an irrevocable escrow account at a state or
24 federally chartered bank which is not owned or controlled by the

13 representatives of the TCA and the SCA shall meet, not less than on
14 an annual basis, to review past practices and examine methods to

18 the TCA any concerns, suspected activities, or pending matters
19 reasonably believed to possibly constitute violations of this
20 Compact by any person, organization or entity, if such disclosure
21 will not compromise the interest sought to be protected.
22 Part 8. STATE MONITORING OF COMPACT
23 A. The SCA shall, pursuant to the provisions of this Compact,
24 have the authority to monitor the conduct of covered games to ensure
Req. No. 1592 Page 43

4 access to all areas of the facility related to the conduct of
5 covered games as provided herein:
6 1. Access to the facility by the SCA shall be during the
7 facility’s normal operating hours only; provided that to the extent
8 such inspections are limited to areas of the facility where the
9 public is normally permitted, SCA agents may inspect the facility
10 without giving prior notice to the enterprise;

15 they shall provide proper photographic identification to the TCA.
16 SCA agents shall be accompanied in nonpublic areas of the facility
17 by a TCA agent. A one-hour notice by SCA to the TCA may be required

19 all times.
20 B. Subject to the provisions herein, agents of the SCA shall
21 have the right to review and copy documents of the enterprise
22 related to its conduct of covered games. The review and copying of
23 such documents shall be during normal business hours or hours
24 otherwise at tribe’s discretion. However, the SCA shall not be
Req. No. 1592 Page 44

1 perm itted to copy those portions of any documents of the enterprise

3 marketing strategies or other proprietary and confidential
4 information of the enterprise, including, but not limited to,
5 customer lists, business plans, advertising programs, marketing
6 studies, and customer demographics or profiles. No documents of the
7 enterprise related to its conduct of covered games or copies thereof
8 shall be released to the public by the state under any
9 circumstances. All such documents shall be deemed confidential
10 documents owned by the tribe and shall not be subject to public
11 release by the state.
12 C. At the completion of any SCA inspection or investigation,
13 the SCA shall forward a written report thereof to the TCA. The TCA
14 shall be apprised on a timely basis of all pertinent,
15 nonconfidential information regarding any violation of federal,
16 state, or tribal laws, the rules or regulations, or this Compact.
17 Nothing herein prevents the SCA from contacting tribal or federal
18 law enforcement authorities for suspected criminal wrongdoing
19 involving the TCA. TCA may interview SCA inspectors upon reasonable
20 notice and examine work papers and SCA in the same fashion that SCA
21 inspectors may examine auditors’ notes and make auditor inquiry
22 unless providing such information to the TCA will compromise the
23 interests sought to be protected. If the SCA determines that
24 providing the information to the TCA will compromise the interests

1 soug ht to be protected, then the SCA shall provide such information
2 to the tribe in accordance with Part 13 14 of this Compact.
3 D. Nothing in this Compact shall be deemed to authorize the
4 state to regulate the tribe’s government, including the TCA, or to
5 interfere in any way with the tribe’s selection of its governmental
6 officers, including members of the TCA; provided, however, the SCA
7 and the tribe, upon request of the tribe, shall jointly employ, at
8 the tribe’s expense, an independent firm to perform on behalf of the
9 SCA the duties set forth in subsections A and B of this Part.
10 Part 9. JURISDICTION

12 adjudicatory or criminal jurisdiction.
13 Part 10. LICENSING

7 investigation being conducted in connection with the renewal of such

9 unreasonable, it may seek resolution of that issue pursuant to Part
10 11 12 of this Compact.
11 3. The application process shall require the TCA to obtain
12 sufficient information and identification from the applicant to
13 permit a background investigation to determine if a license should

17 electronic amusement games, electronic bonanza-style
18 bingo games and electronic instant bingo games,

Req. No. 1592 Page 56

3 nonhouse-banked card games. The tribe is entitled to
4 keep an amount equal to state payments from the common
5 pool(s) or pot(s) as part of its cost of operating the
6 games.
7 Payments of such fees shall be made to the Treasurer of the
8 State of Oklahoma. Nothing Except as provided in Section 4 of this
9 act, nothing herein shall require the allocation of such fees to
10 particular state purposes, including, but not limited to, the actual

20 months ending on June 30 of each year.
21 C. Upon the effective date of this Compact, the tribe shall

Req. No. 1592 Page 57

1 over sight responsibilities hereunder and shall be a one-time payment
2 to the state for such purposes.
3 D. Nothing in this Compact shall be deemed to authorize the
4 state to impose any tax, fee, charge or assessment upon the tribe or

6 provided that, to the extent that the tribe is required under
7 federal law to report prizes awarded, the tribe agrees to copy such
8 reports to the SCA.

10 herein, the state agrees that it will not, during the term of this
11 Compact, permit the nontribal operation of any machines or devices
12 to play covered games or electronic or mechanical gaming devices
13 otherwise presently prohibited by law within the state in excess of
14 the number and outside of the designated locations authorized by the
15 State-Tribal Gaming Act. The state recognizes the importance of
16 this provision to the tribe and agrees, in the event of a breach of
17 this provision by the state, to require any nontribal entity which
18 operates any such devices or machines in excess of such number or
19 outside of the designated location to remit to the state at least
20 quarterly no less than fifty percent (50%) of any increase in the
21 entities’ adjusted gross revenues following the addition of such
22 excess machines. The state further agrees to remit at least
23 quarterly to eligible tribes, as liquidated damages, a sum equal to
24 fifty percent (50%) of any increase in the entities’ adjusted gross

4 this Compact within forty-five (45) miles of an entity which is
5 operating covered game machines in excess of the number authorized
6 by, or outside of the location designated by, the State-Tribal
7 Gaming Act. Such liquidated damages shall be allocated pro rata to
8 eligible tribes based on the number of covered game machines
9 operated by each Eligible Tribe in the time period when such
10 adjusted gross revenues were generated.
11 F. In consideration for the covenants and agreements contained
12 herein, the tribe agrees that in the event it has currently or
13 locates in the future a facility within a radius of twenty (20)
14 miles from a recipient licensee as that term is defined in
15 subsection K of Section 263 of this title that it shall comply with
16 the requirements of subsection K of Section 263 of this title.
17 Part 12. DISPUTE RESOLUTION
18 In the event that either party to this Compact believes that the
19 other party has failed to comply with any requirement of this
20 Compact, or in the event of any dispute hereunder, including, but
21 not limited to, a dispute over the proper interpretation of the
22 terms and conditions of this Compact, the following procedures may
23 be invoked:
24
Req. No. 1592 Page 59

1 1. The goal of the parties shall be to resolve all disputes
2 amicably and voluntarily whenever possible. A party asserting
3 noncompliance or seeking an interpretation of this Compact first
4 shall serve written notice on the other party. The notice shall
5 identify the specific Compact provision alleged to have been
6 violated or in dispute and shall specify in detail the asserting
7 party’s contention and any factual basis for the claim.
8 Representatives of the tribe and state shall meet within thirty (30)
9 days of receipt of notice in an effort to resolve the dispute;
10 2. Subject to the limitation set forth in paragraph 3 of this
11 Part, either party may refer a dispute arising under this Compact to
12 arbitration under the rules of the American Arbitration Association
13 (AAA), subject to enforcement or pursuant to review as provided by
14 paragraph 3 of this Part by a federal district court. The remedies
15 available through arbitration are limited to enforcement of the
16 provisions of this Compact. The parties consent to the jurisdiction
17 of such arbitration forum and court for such limited purposes and no
18 other, and each waives immunity with respect thereto. One
19 arbitrator shall be chosen by the parties from a list of qualified
20 arbitrators to be provided by the AAA. If the parties cannot agree
21 on an arbitrator, then the arbitrator shall be named by the AAA.
22 The expenses of arbitration shall be borne equally by the parties.
23 A party asserting noncompliance or seeking an interpretation of
24 this Compact under this section shall be deemed to have certified
Req. No. 1592 Page 60

1 that to the best of the party’s knowledge, information, and belief
2 formed after reasonable inquiry, the claim of noncompliance or the
3 request for interpretation of this Compact is warranted and made in
4 good faith and not for any improper purpose, such as to harass or to
5 cause unnecessary delay or the needless incurring of the cost of
6 resolving the dispute. If the dispute is found to have been
7 initiated in violation of this Part, the Arbitrator, upon request or
8 upon his or her own initiative, shall impose upon the violating
9 party an appropriate sanction, which may include an award to the
10 other party of its reasonable expenses incurred in having to
11 participate in the arbitration; and
12 3. Notwithstanding any provision of law, either party to the
13 Compact may bring an action against the other in a federal district
14 court for the de novo review of any arbitration award under
15 paragraph 2 of this Part. The decision of the court shall be
16 subject to appeal. Each of the parties hereto waives immunity and
17 consents to suit therein for such limited purposes, and agrees not
18 to raise the Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution or
19 comparable defense to the validity of such waiver.
20 Nothing herein shall be construed to authorize a money judgment
21 other than for damages for failure to comply with an arbitration
22 decision requiring the payment of monies.
