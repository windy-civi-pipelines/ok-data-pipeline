14 shall be subject to the exclusivity payments set forth in Part 11 of
15 this Compact. In the case of electronic bonanza-style bingo games,
16 there have been disagreements between tribes and federal regulators
17 as to whether or not such games are Class II. Without conceding
18 that such games are Class III, the tribe has agreed to compact with
19 the state to operate the specific type of electronic bonanza-style
20 bingo game described in this Compact to remove any legal uncertainty
21 as to the tribe’s right to lawfully operate the game. Should the
22 electronic bonanza-style bingo game or the electronic instant bingo
23 game described in this act be determined to be Class II by the NIGC
24 or a federal court, then the tribe shall have the option to operate
SENATE FLOOR VERSION - SB585 SFLR Page 20
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)

1 such games outside of this Compact; provided, any obligations
2 pursuant to subsection F of Part 11 of this Compact shall not be
3 affected thereby.
4 B. A tribe shall not operate an electronic bonanza-style bingo
5 game, an electronic instant bingo game or an electronic amusement
6 game pursuant to this Compact until such game has been certified by
7 an independent testing laboratory and the TCA as meeting the
8 standards set out in the State-Tribal Gaming Act for electronic
9 bonanza-style bingo games, electronic instant bingo games or
10 electronic amusement games, as applicable or any standards contained
11 in the Oklahoma Horse Racing Commission rules issued pursuant to
12 subsection B of Section 268 of this title that modify the standards
13 for such games that may be conducted by organizational licensees.
14 Provided, the tribe may rely on any certification of an electronic
15 bonanza-style bingo game, an electronic instant bingo, or electronic
16 amusement games by the Oklahoma Horse Racing Commission which was
17 obtained by an organization licensee pursuant to the State-Tribal
18 Gaming Act to establish certification compliance under this Compact.
19 The tribe may also rely on any certification of an electronic
20 bonanza-style bingo game, electronic instant bingo or an electronic
21 amusement game by the TCA obtained by another tribe which has
22 entered into the model compact to establish certification compliance
23 under this Compact.

6 appointment of said representative or indispensable
7 party, and participation of such other party is in
8 lieu of and not in addition to pursuit of the claim by

10 b. the claim of such other party would have been subject
11 to a consent to suit hereunder if it had been made by
12 the claimant directly.
13 D. Remedies in the Event of No or Inadequate Insurance for Tort
14 Claim. In the event a tort claim is made and there is no, or
15 inadequate, insurance in effect as required under this Compact, the
16 enterprise shall be deemed to be in default hereunder unless, within

18 enterprise has posted in an irrevocable escrow account at a state or
19 federally chartered bank which is not owned or controlled by the
20 tribe, sufficient cash, a bond or other security sufficient to cover
21 any award that might be made within the limits set forth in

6 4. The notice and hearing opportunities in accordance with the

15 shall be independent of the enterprise, and shall be supervised and
16 accountable only to the TCA. A TCA compliance officer shall be
17 available to the facility during all hours of operation upon
18 reasonable notice, and shall have immediate access to any and all
19 areas of the facility for the purpose of ensuring compliance with
20 the provisions of this Compact. The TCA shall investigate any such
21 suspected or reported violation of this Compact and shall require

SENATE FLOOR VERSION - SB585 SFLR Page 42
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)

5 independently discovers.
6 C. In order to develop and foster a positive and effective
7 relationship in the enforcement of the provisions of this Compact,
8 representatives of the TCA and the SCA shall meet, not less than on
9 an annual basis, to review past practices and examine methods to

11 shall take place at a location mutually agreed to by the TCA and the
12 SCA. The SCA, prior to or during such meetings, shall disclose to
13 the TCA any concerns, suspected activities, or pending matters
14 reasonably believed to possibly constitute violations of this
15 Compact by any person, organization or entity, if such disclosure
16 will not compromise the interest sought to be protected.
17 Part 8. STATE MONITORING OF COMPACT
18 A. The SCA shall, pursuant to the provisions of this Compact,
19 have the authority to monitor the conduct of covered games to ensure
20 that the covered games are conducted in compliance with the
21 provisions of this Compact. In order to properly monitor the
22 conduct of covered games, agents of the SCA shall have reasonable
23 access to all areas of the facility related to the conduct of
24 covered games as provided herein:
SENATE FLOOR VERSION - SB585 SFLR Page 43
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)

1 1. Access to the facility by the SCA shall be during the
2 facility’s normal operating hours only; provided that to the extent
3 such inspections are limited to areas of the facility where the
4 public is normally permitted, SCA agents may inspect the facility
5 without giving prior notice to the enterprise;
6 2. Any suspected or claimed violations of this Compact or of
7 law shall be directed in writing to the TCA; SCA agents shall not
8 interfere with the functioning of the enterprise; and
9 3. Before SCA agents enter any nonpublic area of the facility,
10 they shall provide proper photographic identification to the TCA.
11 SCA agents shall be accompanied in nonpublic areas of the facility
12 by a TCA agent. A one-hour notice by SCA to the TCA may be required
13 to assure that a TCA officer is available to accompany SCA agents at
14 all times.
15 B. Subject to the provisions herein, agents of the SCA shall
16 have the right to review and copy documents of the enterprise
17 related to its conduct of covered games. The review and copying of
18 such documents shall be during normal business hours or hours
19 otherwise at tribe’s discretion. However, the SCA shall not be
20 permitted to copy those portions of any documents of the enterprise
21 related to its conduct of covered games that contain business or
22 marketing strategies or other proprietary and confidential
23 information of the enterprise, including, but not limited to,
24 customer lists, business plans, advertising programs, marketing
SENATE FLOOR VERSION - SB585 SFLR Page 44
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)

1 stud ies, and customer demographics or profiles. No documents of the
2 enterprise related to its conduct of covered games or copies thereof

4 circumstances. All such documents shall be deemed confidential
5 documents owned by the tribe and shall not be subject to public
6 release by the state.
7 C. At the completion of any SCA inspection or investigation,
8 the SCA shall forward a written report thereof to the TCA. The TCA
9 shall be apprised on a timely basis of all pertinent,
10 nonconfidential information regarding any violation of federal,
11 state, or tribal laws, the rules or regulations, or this Compact.
12 Nothing herein prevents the SCA from contacting tribal or federal
13 law enforcement authorities for suspected criminal wrongdoing
14 involving the TCA. TCA may interview SCA inspectors upon reasonable
15 notice and examine work papers and SCA in the same fashion that SCA
16 inspectors may examine auditors’ notes and make auditor inquiry
17 unless providing such information to the TCA will compromise the
18 interests sought to be protected. If the SCA determines that
19 providing the information to the TCA will compromise the interests
20 sought to be protected, then the SCA shall provide such information
21 to the tribe in accordance with Part 13 14 of this Compact.
22 D. Nothing in this Compact shall be deemed to authorize the
23 state to regulate the tribe’s government, including the TCA, or to
24 interfere in any way with the tribe’s selection of its governmental
SENATE FLOOR VERSION - SB585 SFLR Page 45
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)

1 offi cers, including members of the TCA; provided, however, the SCA

4 SCA the duties set forth in subsections A and B of this Part.
5 Part 9. JURISDICTION

11 by an enterprise unless such person is licensed in accordance with
12 this Compact. In addition to the provisions of this Part which are
13 applicable to the licensing of all covered game employees, the
14 requirements of 25 C.F.R., Part 556, Background Investigations for
15 Primary Management Officials and Key Employees, and 25 C.F.R., Part

24 is valid for a reasonable time pending the outcome of any
SENATE FLOOR VERSION - SB585 SFLR Page 46
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)

1 inve stigation being conducted in connection with the renewal of such
2 license. In the event the SCA contends that any such extension is
3 unreasonable, it may seek resolution of that issue pursuant to Part
4 11 12 of this Compact.
5 3. The application process shall require the TCA to obtain
6 sufficient information and identification from the applicant to
7 permit a background investigation to determine if a license should

8 respect to the issuance or denial of a temporary or permanent
9 license. The SCA may conduct its own background investigation of
10 the applicant at SCA expense, shall notify the TCA of such
11 investigation within a reasonable time from initiation of the
12 investigation, and shall provide a written report to the TCA of the
13 outcome of such investigation within a reasonable time from the
14 receipt of a request from the TCA for such information. SCA
15 inspector field notes and the SCA inspector shall be available upon
16 reasonable notice for TCA review and inquiry.
17 5. The TCA may issue a temporary license for a period not to
18 exceed ninety (90) days, and the enterprise may employ on a
19 probationary basis, any prospective covered game employee who
20 represents in writing that he or she meets the standards set forth
21 in this Part, provided the TCA or enterprise is not in possession of
22 information to the contrary. The temporary license shall expire at
23 the end of the ninety-day period or upon issuance or denial of a
24 permanent license, whichever event occurs first. Provided that the
SENATE FLOOR VERSION - SB585 SFLR Page 48
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)

1 temp orary license period may be extended at the discretion of the
2 TCA so long as good faith efforts are being made by the applicant to

4 its investigation or is waiting on information from others, and
5 provided further that in the course of such temporary or extended
6 temporary licensing period, no information has come to the attention
7 of the TCA which, in the absence of countervailing information then
8 in the record, would otherwise require denial of license. A
9 permanent license shall be issued or denied within a reasonable time
10 following the completion of the applicant’s background
11 investigation.
12 6. In covered gaming the tribe shall not employ and shall
13 terminate, and the TCA shall not license and shall revoke a license

18 statements or information on his or her employment
19 application, or
20 c. is a person whose prior activities, criminal record,
21 or reputation, habits, and associations pose a threat
22 to the public interest or to the effective regulation

7 this subsection A of this Part. Such objection shall be in writing
8 setting forth the basis of the objection. The SCA inspector’s work
9 papers, notes and exhibits which formed the SCA conclusion shall be
10 available upon reasonable notice for TCA review. The enterprise
11 shall have discretion to employ an individual over the objection of
12 the SCA.
13 8. The TCA shall have the discretion to initiate or continue a
14 background investigation of any licensee or license applicant and to
15 take appropriate action with respect to the issuance or continued
16 validity of any license at any time, including suspending or
17 revoking such license.
18 9. The TCA shall require all covered game employees to wear, in
19 plain view, identification cards issued by the TCA which include a
20 photograph of the employee, his or her first name, a four-digit

17 pool(s) or pot(s) as part of its cost of operating the
18 games.
19 Payments of such fees shall be made to the Treasurer of the
20 State of Oklahoma. Nothing Except as provided in Section 4 of this

19 Gaming Act. Such liquidated damages shall be allocated pro rata to
20 eligible tribes based on the number of covered game machines
21 operated by each Eligible Tribe in the time period when such
22 adjusted gross revenues were generated.
23 F. In consideration for the covenants and agreements contained
24 herein, the tribe agrees that in the event it has currently or

7 other party has failed to comply with any requirement of this
8 Compact, or in the event of any dispute hereunder, including, but
9 not limited to, a dispute over the proper interpretation of the
10 terms and conditions of this Compact, the following procedures may
11 be invoked:
