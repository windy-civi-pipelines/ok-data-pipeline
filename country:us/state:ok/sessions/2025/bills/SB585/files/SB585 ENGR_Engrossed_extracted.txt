6 exceed the limit of liability. Under no circumstances shall any
7 consent to suit be effective as to any award which exceeds such
8 applicable amounts. This consent shall only extend to the patron
9 actually claiming to have been injured. A tort claim shall not be
10 assignable. In the event any assignment of the tort claim is made
11 in violation of this Compact, or any person other than the patron
12 claiming the injury becomes a party to any action hereunder, this
13 consent shall be deemed revoked for all purposes. Notwithstanding
14 the foregoing, consent to suit shall not be revoked if an action on

ENGR. S. B. NO. 585 Page 38
1 party, and participation of such other party is in
2 lieu of and not in addition to pursuit of the claim by
3 the patron, and
4 b. the claim of such other party would have been subject
5 to a consent to suit hereunder if it had been made by
6 the claimant directly; and
7 2. For prize claims, consent is granted only to the extent such
8 claim does not exceed the prize limit. Under no circumstances shall
9 any award exceed the prize limit. This consent shall only extend to
10 the patron actually claiming to have engaged in the play of a
11 covered game on which the claim is based. Prize claims shall not be
12 assignable. In the event any assignment of the prize claim is made,
13 or any person other than the claimant entitled to make the claim
14 becomes a party to any action hereunder, this consent shall be
15 deemed revoked for all purposes. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
16 consent to suit shall not be revoked if an action on a prize claim
17 is filed by (i) a court-appointed representative of a claimant’s
18 estate, or (ii) an indispensable party, provided that nothing herein
19 is intended to, or shall constitute a consent to suit against the
20 enterprise as to such party except to the extent such party’s claim
21 is:
22 a. in lieu of and identical to the claim that would have
23 been made by the claimant directly but for the
24 appointment of said representative or indispensable
ENGR. S. B. NO. 585 Page 39
1 party, and participation of such other party is in
2 lieu of and not in addition to pursuit of the claim by
3 the patron, and
4 b. the claim of such other party would have been subject
5 to a consent to suit hereunder if it had been made by
6 the claimant directly.
7 D. Remedies in the Event of No or Inadequate Insurance for Tort
8 Claim. In the event a tort claim is made and there is no, or
9 inadequate, insurance in effect as required under this Compact, the

11 ten (10) days of a demand by the SCA or a claimant to do so, the
12 enterprise has posted in an irrevocable escrow account at a state or
13 federally chartered bank which is not owned or controlled by the
14 tribe, sufficient cash, a bond or other security sufficient to cover
15 any award that might be made within the limits set forth in
16 paragraph 1 of subsection A of this Part, and informs the claimant
17 and the state of:
18 1. The posting of the cash or bond;
19 2. The means by which the deposit can be independently verified
20 as to the amount and the fact that it is irrevocable until the

24
ENGR. S. B. NO. 585 Page 40
1 4. The notice and hearing opportunities in accordance with the
2 tribe’s tort law, if any, otherwise in accordance with principles of
3 due process, which will be afforded to the claimant so that the
4 intent of this Compact to provide claimants with a meaningful
5 opportunity to seek a just remedy under fair conditions will be
6 fulfilled.
7 Part 7. ENFORCEMENT OF COMPACT PROVISIONS
8 A. The tribe and TCA shall be responsible for regulating
9 activities pursuant to this Compact. As part of its
10 responsibilities, the tribe shall require the enterprise do the
11 following:
12 1. Operate the conduct of covered games in compliance with this
13 Compact, including, but not limited to, the standards and the
14 tribe’s rules and regulations;
15 2. Take reasonable measures to assure the physical safety of
16 enterprise patrons and personnel, prevent illegal activity at the
17 facility, and protect any rights of patrons under the Indian Civil
18 Rights Act of 1968, 25 U.S.C., Sec. 1302-1303 Sections 1302 through
19 1303;
20 3. Promptly notify appropriate law enforcement authorities of
21 persons who may be involved in illegal acts in accordance with
22 applicable law;
23
24
ENGR. S. B. NO. 585 Page 41
1 4. Assure that the construction and maintenance of the facility
2 meets or exceeds federal and tribal standards for comparable
3 buildings; and
4 5. Prepare adequate emergency access plans to ensure the health
5 and safety of all covered game patrons. Upon the finalization of
6 emergency access plans, the TCA or enterprise shall forward copies
7 of such plans to the SCA.
8 B. All licenses for members and employees of the TCA shall be
9 issued according to the same standards and terms applicable to
10 facility employees. The TCA shall employ qualified compliance
11 officers under the authority of the TCA. The compliance officers
12 shall be independent of the enterprise, and shall be supervised and
13 accountable only to the TCA. A TCA compliance officer shall be
14 available to the facility during all hours of operation upon
15 reasonable notice, and shall have immediate access to any and all
16 areas of the facility for the purpose of ensuring compliance with
17 the provisions of this Compact. The TCA shall investigate any such
18 suspected or reported violation of this Compact and shall require
19 the enterprise to correct such violations. The TCA shall officially
20 enter into its files timely written reports of investigations and
21 any action taken thereon, and shall forward copies of such reports
22 to the SCA within fifteen (15) days of such filing. Any such
23 violations shall be reported immediately to the TCA, and the TCA
24 shall immediately forward the same to the SCA. In addition, the TCA
ENGR. S. B. NO. 585 Page 42
1 shal l promptly report to the SCA any such violations which it
2 independently discovers.
3 C. In order to develop and foster a positive and effective
4 relationship in the enforcement of the provisions of this Compact,
5 representatives of the TCA and the SCA shall meet, not less than on
6 an annual basis, to review past practices and examine methods to
7 improve the regulatory scheme created by this Compact. The meetings
8 shall take place at a location mutually agreed to by the TCA and the
9 SCA. The SCA, prior to or during such meetings, shall disclose to
10 the TCA any concerns, suspected activities, or pending matters
11 reasonably believed to possibly constitute violations of this
12 Compact by any person, organization or entity, if such disclosure
13 will not compromise the interest sought to be protected.
14 Part 8. STATE MONITORING OF COMPACT
15 A. The SCA shall, pursuant to the provisions of this Compact,
16 have the authority to monitor the conduct of covered games to ensure
17 that the covered games are conducted in compliance with the
18 provisions of this Compact. In order to properly monitor the
19 conduct of covered games, agents of the SCA shall have reasonable
20 access to all areas of the facility related to the conduct of
21 covered games as provided herein:
22 1. Access to the facility by the SCA shall be during the
23 facility’s normal operating hours only; provided that to the extent
24 such inspections are limited to areas of the facility where the
ENGR. S. B. NO. 585 Page 43
1 publ ic is normally permitted, SCA agents may inspect the facility
2 without giving prior notice to the enterprise;
3 2. Any suspected or claimed violations of this Compact or of
4 law shall be directed in writing to the TCA; SCA agents shall not
5 interfere with the functioning of the enterprise; and
6 3. Before SCA agents enter any nonpublic area of the facility,
7 they shall provide proper photographic identification to the TCA.
8 SCA agents shall be accompanied in nonpublic areas of the facility
9 by a TCA agent. A one-hour notice by SCA to the TCA may be required
10 to assure that a TCA officer is available to accompany SCA agents at
11 all times.
12 B. Subject to the provisions herein, agents of the SCA shall
13 have the right to review and copy documents of the enterprise
14 related to its conduct of covered games. The review and copying of
15 such documents shall be during normal business hours or hours
16 otherwise at tribe’s discretion. However, the SCA shall not be
17 permitted to copy those portions of any documents of the enterprise
18 related to its conduct of covered games that contain business or
19 marketing strategies or other proprietary and confidential
20 information of the enterprise, including, but not limited to,
21 customer lists, business plans, advertising programs, marketing
22 studies, and customer demographics or profiles. No documents of the
23 enterprise related to its conduct of covered games or copies thereof
24 shall be released to the public by the state under any
ENGR. S. B. NO. 585 Page 44
1 circ umstances. All such documents shall be deemed confidential
2 documents owned by the tribe and shall not be subject to public
3 release by the state.
4 C. At the completion of any SCA inspection or investigation,
5 the SCA shall forward a written report thereof to the TCA. The TCA
6 shall be apprised on a timely basis of all pertinent,
7 nonconfidential information regarding any violation of federal,
8 state, or tribal laws, the rules or regulations, or this Compact.
9 Nothing herein prevents the SCA from contacting tribal or federal
10 law enforcement authorities for suspected criminal wrongdoing
11 involving the TCA. TCA may interview SCA inspectors upon reasonable
12 notice and examine work papers and SCA in the same fashion that SCA
13 inspectors may examine auditors’ notes and make auditor inquiry
14 unless providing such information to the TCA will compromise the
15 interests sought to be protected. If the SCA determines that
16 providing the information to the TCA will compromise the interests
17 sought to be protected, then the SCA shall provide such information
18 to the tribe in accordance with Part 13 14 of this Compact.
19 D. Nothing in this Compact shall be deemed to authorize the
20 state to regulate the tribe’s government, including the TCA, or to
21 interfere in any way with the tribe’s selection of its governmental
22 officers, including members of the TCA; provided, however, the SCA
23 and the tribe, upon request of the tribe, shall jointly employ, at
24
ENGR. S. B. NO. 585 Page 45
1 the tribe’s expense, an independent firm to perform on behalf of the
2 SCA the duties set forth in subsections A and B of this Part.
3 Part 9. JURISDICTION
4 This Compact shall not alter tribal, federal or state civil
5 adjudicatory or criminal jurisdiction.
6 Part 10. LICENSING
7 A. 1. Except as provided in paragraph 6 of Part 3 of this
8 Compact, no covered game employee shall be employed at a facility or
9 by an enterprise unless such person is licensed in accordance with
10 this Compact. In addition to the provisions of this Part which are
11 applicable to the licensing of all covered game employees, the
12 requirements of 25 C.F.R., Part 556, Background Investigations for
13 Primary Management Officials and Key Employees, and 25 C.F.R., Part
14 558, Gaming Licenses for Key Employees and Primary Management
15 Officials, apply to Key Employees and Primary Management Officials
16 of the facility and enterprise.
17 2. All prospective covered game employees shall apply to the
18 TCA for a license. Licenses shall be issued for periods of no more
19 than two (2) years, after which they may be renewed only following
20 review and update of the information upon which the license was
21 based; provided, the TCA may extend the period in which the license
22 is valid for a reasonable time pending the outcome of any
23 investigation being conducted in connection with the renewal of such
24 license. In the event the SCA contends that any such extension is
ENGR. S. B. NO. 585 Page 46
1 unre asonable, it may seek resolution of that issue pursuant to Part
2 11 12 of this Compact.
3 3. The application process shall require the TCA to obtain
4 sufficient information and identification from the applicant to
5 permit a background investigation to determine if a license should
6 be issued in accordance with this Part and the rules and
7 regulations. The TCA shall obtain information about a prospective
8 covered game employee that includes:
9 a. full name, including any aliases by which applicant
10 has ever been known,
11 b. social security number,
12 c. date and place of birth,
13 d. residential addresses for the past five (5) years,
14 e. employment history for the past five (5) years,
15 f. driver license number,
16 g. all licenses issued and disciplinary charges filed,
17 whether or not discipline was imposed, by any state or
18 tribal regulatory authority,
19 h. all criminal arrests and proceedings, except for minor
20 traffic offenses, to which the applicant has been a
21 party,
22 i. a set of fingerprints,
23 j. a current photograph,
24 k. military service history, and
ENGR. S. B. NO. 585 Page 47
1 l. any other information the TCA determines is necessary
2 to conduct a thorough background investigation.
3 4. Upon obtaining the required initial information from a
4 prospective covered game employee, the TCA shall forward a copy of
5 such information to the SCA, along with any determinations made with
6 respect to the issuance or denial of a temporary or permanent
7 license. The SCA may conduct its own background investigation of
8 the applicant at SCA expense, shall notify the TCA of such
9 investigation within a reasonable time from initiation of the
10 investigation, and shall provide a written report to the TCA of the
11 outcome of such investigation within a reasonable time from the
12 receipt of a request from the TCA for such information. SCA
13 inspector field notes and the SCA inspector shall be available upon
14 reasonable notice for TCA review and inquiry.
15 5. The TCA may issue a temporary license for a period not to
16 exceed ninety (90) days, and the enterprise may employ on a
17 probationary basis, any prospective covered game employee who
18 represents in writing that he or she meets the standards set forth
19 in this Part, provided the TCA or enterprise is not in possession of
20 information to the contrary. The temporary license shall expire at
21 the end of the ninety-day period or upon issuance or denial of a
22 permanent license, whichever event occurs first. Provided that the
23 temporary license period may be extended at the discretion of the
24 TCA so long as good faith efforts are being made by the applicant to
ENGR. S. B. NO. 585 Page 48
1 prov ide required information, or the TCA is continuing to conduct
2 its investigation or is waiting on information from others, and
3 provided further that in the course of such temporary or extended
4 temporary licensing period, no information has come to the attention
5 of the TCA which, in the absence of countervailing information then
6 in the record, would otherwise require denial of license. A
7 permanent license shall be issued or denied within a reasonable time
8 following the completion of the applicant’s background
9 investigation.
10 6. In covered gaming the tribe shall not employ and shall
11 terminate, and the TCA shall not license and shall revoke a license
12 previously issued to, any covered game employee who:
13 a. has been convicted of any felony or an offense related
14 to any covered games or other gaming activity,
15 b. has knowingly and willfully provided false material,
16 statements or information on his or her employment
17 application, or
18 c. is a person whose prior activities, criminal record,
19 or reputation, habits, and associations pose a threat
20 to the public interest or to the effective regulation
21 and control of the conduct of covered games, or create
22 or enhance the dangers of unsuitable, unfair, or
23 illegal practices, methods, and activities in the
24 conduct of covered games or the carrying on of the
ENGR. S. B. NO. 585 Page 49
1 business and financial arrangements incidental
2 thereto.
3 7. The SCA may object to the employment of any individual by
4 the enterprise based upon the criteria set forth in paragraph 6 of
5 this subsection A of this Part. Such objection shall be in writing
6 setting forth the basis of the objection. The SCA inspector’s work
7 papers, notes and exhibits which formed the SCA conclusion shall be
8 available upon reasonable notice for TCA review. The enterprise
9 shall have discretion to employ an individual over the objection of
10 the SCA.
11 8. The TCA shall have the discretion to initiate or continue a
12 background investigation of any licensee or license applicant and to
13 take appropriate action with respect to the issuance or continued
14 validity of any license at any time, including suspending or
15 revoking such license.
16 9. The TCA shall require all covered game employees to wear, in
17 plain view, identification cards issued by the TCA which include a
18 photograph of the employee, his or her first name, a four-digit
19 identification number unique to the license issued to the employee,
20 a tribal seal or signature verifying official issuance of the card,
21 and a date of expiration, which shall not extend beyond such
22 employee’s license expiration date.
23 B. 1. Any person or entity who, directly or indirectly,
24 provides or is likely to provide at least Twenty-five Thousand
ENGR. S. B. NO. 585 Page 50
1 Doll ars ($25,000.00) in goods or services to the enterprise in any
2 twelve-month period, or who has received at least Twenty-five
3 Thousand Dollars ($25,000.00) for goods or services provided to the
4 enterprise in any consecutive twelve-month period within the
5 immediately preceding twenty-four-month period, or any person or
6 entity who provides through sale, lease, rental or otherwise covered
7 games, or parts, maintenance or service in connection therewith to
8 the tribe or the enterprise at any time and in any amount, shall be
9 licensed by the TCA prior to the provision thereof. Provided, that
10 attorneys or certified public accountants and their firms shall be
11 exempt from the licensing requirement herein to the extent that they
12 are providing services covered by their professional licenses.
13 2. Background investigations and licensing shall follow the
14 same process and apply the same criteria as for covered game
15 employees set forth in paragraph 6 of subsection A of this Part.
16 3. In the case of a license application of any entity, all
17 principals thereof shall be subjected to the same background
18 investigation required for the licensing of a covered game employee,
19 but no license as such need be issued; provided, no license shall be
20 issued to the entity if the TCA determines that one or more of its
21 principals will be persons who would not be qualified to receive a
22 license if they applied as covered game employees.
23 4. Nothing herein shall prohibit the TCA from processing and
24 issuing a license to a principal in his or her own name.
ENGR. S. B. NO. 585 Page 51
1 5. Licenses issued under this subsection shall be reviewed at
2 least every two (2) years for continuing compliance, and shall be
3 promptly revoked if the licensee is determined to be in violation of
4 the standards set forth in paragraph 6 of subsection A of this Part.
5 In connection with such a review, the TCA shall require the person
6 or entity to update all information provided in the previous
7 application.
8 6. The enterprise shall not enter into, or continue to make
9 payments pursuant to, any contract or agreement for the provision of
10 goods or services with any person or entity who does not meet the
11 requirements of this Part including, but not limited to, any person
12 or entity whose application to the TCA for a license has been
13 denied, or whose license has expired or been suspended or revoked.
14 7. Pursuant to 25 C.F.R., Part 533, all management contracts
15 must be approved by the Chair of the National Indian Gaming
16 Commission. The SCA shall be notified promptly after any such
17 approval.
18 8. In addition to any licensing criteria set forth above, if
19 any person or entity seeking licensing under this subsection is to
20 receive any fee or other payment based on the revenues or profits of
21 the enterprise, the TCA may take into account whether or not such
22 fee or other payment is fair in light of market conditions and
23 practices.
24
ENGR. S. B. NO. 585 Page 52
1 C. 1. Subject to the exceptions set forth in paragraph 4 of
2 this subsection, any person or entity extending financing, directly
3 or indirectly, to the facility or enterprise in excess of Fifty
4 Thousand Dollars ($50,000.00) in any twelve-month period shall be
5 licensed prior to providing such financing. Principals thereof
6 shall be subjected to background investigations and determinations
7 in accordance with the procedures and standards set forth in
8 subsection A of this Part. Licenses issued under this section shall
9 be reviewed at least every two (2) years for continuing compliance,
10 and shall be promptly revoked if the licensee is determined to be in
11 violation of the standards set forth in paragraph 6 of subsection A
12 of this Part. In connection with such a review, the TCA shall
13 require the person or entity to update all information provided in
14 the previous application.
15 2. The SCA shall be notified of all financing and loan
16 transactions with respect to covered games or supplies in which the
17 amount exceeds Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000.00) in any twelve-
18 month period, and shall be entitled to review copies of all
19 agreements and documents in connection therewith.
20 3. A supplier of goods or services who provides financing
21 exclusively in connection with the sale or lease of covered games
22 equipment or supplies shall be licensed solely in accordance with
23 licensing procedures applicable, if at all, to such suppliers
24 herein.
ENGR. S. B. NO. 585 Page 53

2 regulated bank, savings and loan, or trust, or other federally or
3 state-regulated lending institution; any agency of the federal,
4 state, tribal or local government; or any person or entity,
5 including, but not limited to, an institutional investor who, alone
6 or in conjunction with others, lends money through publicly or
7 commercially traded bonds or other commercially traded instruments,
8 including but not limited to the holders of such bonds or
9 instruments or their assignees or transferees, or which bonds or
10 commercially traded instruments are underwritten by any entity whose
11 shares are publicly traded or which underwriter, at the time of the
12 underwriting, has assets in excess of One Hundred Million Dollars
13 ($100,000,000.00), shall be exempt from the licensing and background
14 investigation requirements in subsection B of this Part or this
15 subsection.
16 D. In the event the SCA objects to a lender, vendor or any
17 other person or entity within subsection B or C of this Part seeking
18 to do business with the enterprise, or to the continued holding of a
19 license by such person or entity, it may notify the TCA of its
20 objection. The notice shall set forth the basis of the objection
21 with sufficient particularity to enable the TCA to investigate the
22 basis of the objection. The SCA inspector and SCA inspector field
23 notes shall be available for TCA review and inquiry. Within a
24 reasonable time after such notification, the TCA shall report to the
ENGR. S. B. NO. 585 Page 54
1 SCA on the outcome of its investigation and of any action taken or
2 decision not to take action.
3 Part 11. EXCLUSIVITY AND FEES
4 A. The parties acknowledge and recognize that this Compact
5 provides tribes with substantial exclusivity and, consistent with
6 the goals of IGRA, special opportunities for tribal economic
7 opportunity through gaming within the external boundaries of
8 Oklahoma in respect to the covered games. In consideration thereof,
9 so long as the state does not change its laws after the effective
10 date of this Compact to permit the operation of any additional form
11 of gaming by any such organization licensee, or change its laws to
12 permit any additional electronic or machine gaming within Oklahoma,
13 the tribe agrees to pay the following fees:
14 1. The tribe covenants and agrees to pay to the state a fee
15 derived from covered game revenues calculated as set forth in
16 paragraph 2 of this subsection. Such fee shall be paid no later
17 than the twentieth day of the month for revenues received by the
18 tribe in the preceding month; and
19 2. The fee shall be:
20 a. four percent (4%) of the first Ten Million Dollars
21 ($10,000,000.00) of adjusted gross revenues received
22 by a tribe in a calendar year from the play of
23 electronic amusement games, electronic bonanza-style
24 bingo games and electronic instant bingo games,
ENGR. S. B. NO. 585 Page 55
1 b. five percent (5%) of the next Ten Million Dollars
2 ($10,000,000.00) of adjusted gross revenues received
3 by a tribe in a calendar year from the play of
4 electronic amusement games, electronic bonanza-style
5 bingo games and electronic instant bingo games,
6 c. six percent (6%) of all subsequent adjusted gross
7 revenues received by a tribe in a calendar year from
8 the play of electronic amusement games, electronic
9 bonanza-style bingo games and electronic instant bingo
10 games, and
11 d. ten percent (10%) of the monthly net win of the common
12 pool(s) or pot(s) from which prizes are paid for
13 nonhouse-banked card games. The tribe is entitled to
14 keep an amount equal to state payments from the common
15 pool(s) or pot(s) as part of its cost of operating the
16 games.
17 Payments of such fees shall be made to the Treasurer of the
18 State of Oklahoma. Nothing Except as provided in Section 4 of this
19 act, nothing herein shall require the allocation of such fees to
20 particular state purposes, including, but not limited to, the actual
21 costs of performing the state’s regulatory responsibilities
22 hereunder.
23 B. Annual oversight assessment. In addition to the fee
24 provided for in subsection A of this Part, the state shall be
ENGR. S. B. NO. 585 Page 56
1 enti tled to payment for its costs incurred in connection with the
2 oversight of covered games to the extent provided herein, “annual
3 oversight assessment”. The annual oversight assessment, which shall
4 be Thirty-five Thousand Dollars ($35,000.00), shall be determined
5 and paid in advance on a fiscal year basis for each twelve (12)
6 months ending on June 30 of each year.
7 C. Upon the effective date of this Compact, the tribe shall
8 deposit with the SCA the sum of Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000.00)
9 (“start-up assessment”). The purpose of the start-up assessment
10 shall be to assist the state in initiating its administrative and
11 oversight responsibilities hereunder and shall be a one-time payment
12 to the state for such purposes.
13 D. Nothing in this Compact shall be deemed to authorize the
14 state to impose any tax, fee, charge or assessment upon the tribe or
15 enterprise except as expressly authorized pursuant to this Compact;
16 provided that, to the extent that the tribe is required under
17 federal law to report prizes awarded, the tribe agrees to copy such
18 reports to the SCA.
19 E. In consideration for the covenants and agreements contained
20 herein, the state agrees that it will not, during the term of this
21 Compact, permit the nontribal operation of any machines or devices
22 to play covered games or electronic or mechanical gaming devices
23 otherwise presently prohibited by law within the state in excess of
24 the number and outside of the designated locations authorized by the
ENGR. S. B. NO. 585 Page 57
1 Stat e-Tribal Gaming Act. The state recognizes the importance of
2 this provision to the tribe and agrees, in the event of a breach of
3 this provision by the state, to require any nontribal entity which
4 operates any such devices or machines in excess of such number or
5 outside of the designated location to remit to the state at least
6 quarterly no less than fifty percent (50%) of any increase in the
7 entities’ adjusted gross revenues following the addition of such
8 excess machines. The state further agrees to remit at least
9 quarterly to eligible tribes, as liquidated damages, a sum equal to
10 fifty percent (50%) of any increase in the entities’ adjusted gross
11 revenues following the addition of such excess machines. For
12 purposes of this Part, “eligible tribes” means those tribes which
13 have entered into this Compact and are operating gaming pursuant to
14 this Compact within forty-five (45) miles of an entity which is
15 operating covered game machines in excess of the number authorized
16 by, or outside of the location designated by, the State-Tribal
17 Gaming Act. Such liquidated damages shall be allocated pro rata to
18 eligible tribes based on the number of covered game machines
19 operated by each Eligible Tribe in the time period when such
20 adjusted gross revenues were generated.
21 F. In consideration for the covenants and agreements contained
22 herein, the tribe agrees that in the event it has currently or
23 locates in the future a facility within a radius of twenty (20)
24 miles from a recipient licensee as that term is defined in
ENGR. S. B. NO. 585 Page 58
1 subs ection K of Section 263 of this title that it shall comply with
2 the requirements of subsection K of Section 263 of this title.
3 Part 12. DISPUTE RESOLUTION
4 In the event that either party to this Compact believes that the
5 other party has failed to comply with any requirement of this
6 Compact, or in the event of any dispute hereunder, including, but
7 not limited to, a dispute over the proper interpretation of the
8 terms and conditions of this Compact, the following procedures may
9 be invoked:
10 1. The goal of the parties shall be to resolve all disputes
11 amicably and voluntarily whenever possible. A party asserting
12 noncompliance or seeking an interpretation of this Compact first
13 shall serve written notice on the other party. The notice shall
14 identify the specific Compact provision alleged to have been
15 violated or in dispute and shall specify in detail the asserting
16 party’s contention and any factual basis for the claim.
17 Representatives of the tribe and state shall meet within thirty (30)
18 days of receipt of notice in an effort to resolve the dispute;
19 2. Subject to the limitation set forth in paragraph 3 of this
20 Part, either party may refer a dispute arising under this Compact to
21 arbitration under the rules of the American Arbitration Association
22 (AAA), subject to enforcement or pursuant to review as provided by
23 paragraph 3 of this Part by a federal district court. The remedies
24 available through arbitration are limited to enforcement of the
ENGR. S. B. NO. 585 Page 59
1 prov isions of this Compact. The parties consent to the jurisdiction
2 of such arbitration forum and court for such limited purposes and no
3 other, and each waives immunity with respect thereto. One
4 arbitrator shall be chosen by the parties from a list of qualified
5 arbitrators to be provided by the AAA. If the parties cannot agree
6 on an arbitrator, then the arbitrator shall be named by the AAA.
7 The expenses of arbitration shall be borne equally by the parties.
8 A party asserting noncompliance or seeking an interpretation of
9 this Compact under this section shall be deemed to have certified
10 that to the best of the party’s knowledge, information, and belief
11 formed after reasonable inquiry, the claim of noncompliance or the
12 request for interpretation of this Compact is warranted and made in
13 good faith and not for any improper purpose, such as to harass or to
14 cause unnecessary delay or the needless incurring of the cost of
15 resolving the dispute. If the dispute is found to have been
16 initiated in violation of this Part, the Arbitrator, upon request or
17 upon his or her own initiative, shall impose upon the violating
18 party an appropriate sanction, which may include an award to the
19 other party of its reasonable expenses incurred in having to
20 participate in the arbitration; and
21 3. Notwithstanding any provision of law, either party to the
22 Compact may bring an action against the other in a federal district
23 court for the de novo review of any arbitration award under
24 paragraph 2 of this Part. The decision of the court shall be
ENGR. S. B. NO. 585 Page 60
1 subj ect to appeal. Each of the parties hereto waives immunity and
2 consents to suit therein for such limited purposes, and agrees not
3 to raise the Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution or

3 following additional conditions and limitations:
4 1. For tort claims, consent to suit is granted only to the
5 extent such claim or any award or judgment rendered thereon does not
6 exceed the limit of liability. Under no circumstances shall any
7 consent to suit be effective as to any award which exceeds such
8 applicable amounts. This consent shall only extend to the patron
9 actually claiming to have been injured. A tort claim shall not be
10 assignable. In the event any assignment of the tort claim is made
11 in violation of this Compact, or any person other than the patron
12 claiming the injury becomes a party to any action hereunder, this
13 consent shall be deemed revoked for all purposes. Notwithstanding
14 the foregoing, consent to suit shall not be revoked if an action on
15 a tort claim is filed by (i) a court appointed representative of a
16 claimant’s estate, (ii) an indispensable party, or (iii) a health
17 provider or other party subrogated to the claimant’s rights by
18 virtue of any insurance policy; provided, that nothing herein is
19 intended to, or shall constitute a consent to suit against the
20 enterprise as to such party except to the extent such party’s claim
21 is:
22 a. in lieu of and identical to the claim that would have
23 been made by the claimant directly but for the
24 appointment of said representative or indispensable
ENGR. S. B. NO. 585 Page 38

1 party, and participation of such other party is in
2 lieu of and not in addition to pursuit of the claim by
3 the patron, and
4 b. the claim of such other party would have been subject
5 to a consent to suit hereunder if it had been made by
6 the claimant directly; and
7 2. For prize claims, consent is granted only to the extent such
8 claim does not exceed the prize limit. Under no circumstances shall
9 any award exceed the prize limit. This consent shall only extend to
10 the patron actually claiming to have engaged in the play of a
11 covered game on which the claim is based. Prize claims shall not be
12 assignable. In the event any assignment of the prize claim is made,
13 or any person other than the claimant entitled to make the claim
14 becomes a party to any action hereunder, this consent shall be
15 deemed revoked for all purposes. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
16 consent to suit shall not be revoked if an action on a prize claim
17 is filed by (i) a court-appointed representative of a claimant’s
18 estate, or (ii) an indispensable party, provided that nothing herein
19 is intended to, or shall constitute a consent to suit against the
20 enterprise as to such party except to the extent such party’s claim
21 is:
22 a. in lieu of and identical to the claim that would have
23 been made by the claimant directly but for the
24 appointment of said representative or indispensable
ENGR. S. B. NO. 585 Page 39

1 party, and participation of such other party is in
2 lieu of and not in addition to pursuit of the claim by
3 the patron, and
4 b. the claim of such other party would have been subject
5 to a consent to suit hereunder if it had been made by
6 the claimant directly.
7 D. Remedies in the Event of No or Inadequate Insurance for Tort
8 Claim. In the event a tort claim is made and there is no, or
9 inadequate, insurance in effect as required under this Compact, the
10 enterprise shall be deemed to be in default hereunder unless, within
11 ten (10) days of a demand by the SCA or a claimant to do so, the
12 enterprise has posted in an irrevocable escrow account at a state or
13 federally chartered bank which is not owned or controlled by the
14 tribe, sufficient cash, a bond or other security sufficient to cover
15 any award that might be made within the limits set forth in
16 paragraph 1 of subsection A of this Part, and informs the claimant
17 and the state of:
18 1. The posting of the cash or bond;
19 2. The means by which the deposit can be independently verified
20 as to the amount and the fact that it is irrevocable until the
21 matter is finally resolved;
22 3. The right of the claimant to have this claim satisfied from
23 the deposit if the claimant is successful on the claim; and
24

2 tribe’s tort law, if any, otherwise in accordance with principles of
3 due process, which will be afforded to the claimant so that the
4 intent of this Compact to provide claimants with a meaningful
5 opportunity to seek a just remedy under fair conditions will be
6 fulfilled.

6 emergency access plans, the TCA or enterprise shall forward copies
7 of such plans to the SCA.
8 B. All licenses for members and employees of the TCA shall be
9 issued according to the same standards and terms applicable to
10 facility employees. The TCA shall employ qualified compliance
11 officers under the authority of the TCA. The compliance officers

13 accountable only to the TCA. A TCA compliance officer shall be
14 available to the facility during all hours of operation upon
15 reasonable notice, and shall have immediate access to any and all
16 areas of the facility for the purpose of ensuring compliance with
17 the provisions of this Compact. The TCA shall investigate any such
18 suspected or reported violation of this Compact and shall require
19 the enterprise to correct such violations. The TCA shall officially
20 enter into its files timely written reports of investigations and
21 any action taken thereon, and shall forward copies of such reports
22 to the SCA within fifteen (15) days of such filing. Any such
23 violations shall be reported immediately to the TCA, and the TCA
24 shall immediately forward the same to the SCA. In addition, the TCA
ENGR. S. B. NO. 585 Page 42

1 shal l promptly report to the SCA any such violations which it
2 independently discovers.
3 C. In order to develop and foster a positive and effective
4 relationship in the enforcement of the provisions of this Compact,
5 representatives of the TCA and the SCA shall meet, not less than on
6 an annual basis, to review past practices and examine methods to
7 improve the regulatory scheme created by this Compact. The meetings
8 shall take place at a location mutually agreed to by the TCA and the
9 SCA. The SCA, prior to or during such meetings, shall disclose to
10 the TCA any concerns, suspected activities, or pending matters
11 reasonably believed to possibly constitute violations of this
12 Compact by any person, organization or entity, if such disclosure
13 will not compromise the interest sought to be protected.
14 Part 8. STATE MONITORING OF COMPACT
15 A. The SCA shall, pursuant to the provisions of this Compact,
16 have the authority to monitor the conduct of covered games to ensure
17 that the covered games are conducted in compliance with the
18 provisions of this Compact. In order to properly monitor the
19 conduct of covered games, agents of the SCA shall have reasonable
20 access to all areas of the facility related to the conduct of
21 covered games as provided herein:
22 1. Access to the facility by the SCA shall be during the
23 facility’s normal operating hours only; provided that to the extent
24 such inspections are limited to areas of the facility where the
ENGR. S. B. NO. 585 Page 43

1 publ ic is normally permitted, SCA agents may inspect the facility
2 without giving prior notice to the enterprise;
3 2. Any suspected or claimed violations of this Compact or of
4 law shall be directed in writing to the TCA; SCA agents shall not
5 interfere with the functioning of the enterprise; and
6 3. Before SCA agents enter any nonpublic area of the facility,
7 they shall provide proper photographic identification to the TCA.
8 SCA agents shall be accompanied in nonpublic areas of the facility
9 by a TCA agent. A one-hour notice by SCA to the TCA may be required
10 to assure that a TCA officer is available to accompany SCA agents at
11 all times.
12 B. Subject to the provisions herein, agents of the SCA shall
13 have the right to review and copy documents of the enterprise
14 related to its conduct of covered games. The review and copying of
15 such documents shall be during normal business hours or hours
16 otherwise at tribe’s discretion. However, the SCA shall not be
17 permitted to copy those portions of any documents of the enterprise
18 related to its conduct of covered games that contain business or
19 marketing strategies or other proprietary and confidential
20 information of the enterprise, including, but not limited to,
21 customer lists, business plans, advertising programs, marketing
22 studies, and customer demographics or profiles. No documents of the
23 enterprise related to its conduct of covered games or copies thereof
24 shall be released to the public by the state under any
ENGR. S. B. NO. 585 Page 44

1 circ umstances. All such documents shall be deemed confidential
2 documents owned by the tribe and shall not be subject to public
3 release by the state.
4 C. At the completion of any SCA inspection or investigation,
5 the SCA shall forward a written report thereof to the TCA. The TCA
6 shall be apprised on a timely basis of all pertinent,
7 nonconfidential information regarding any violation of federal,
8 state, or tribal laws, the rules or regulations, or this Compact.
9 Nothing herein prevents the SCA from contacting tribal or federal
10 law enforcement authorities for suspected criminal wrongdoing
11 involving the TCA. TCA may interview SCA inspectors upon reasonable
12 notice and examine work papers and SCA in the same fashion that SCA
13 inspectors may examine auditors’ notes and make auditor inquiry
14 unless providing such information to the TCA will compromise the
15 interests sought to be protected. If the SCA determines that
16 providing the information to the TCA will compromise the interests
17 sought to be protected, then the SCA shall provide such information
18 to the tribe in accordance with Part 13 14 of this Compact.
19 D. Nothing in this Compact shall be deemed to authorize the
20 state to regulate the tribe’s government, including the TCA, or to
21 interfere in any way with the tribe’s selection of its governmental
22 officers, including members of the TCA; provided, however, the SCA
23 and the tribe, upon request of the tribe, shall jointly employ, at
24
ENGR. S. B. NO. 585 Page 45

1 the tribe’s expense, an independent firm to perform on behalf of the
2 SCA the duties set forth in subsections A and B of this Part.

4 This Compact shall not alter tribal, federal or state civil
5 adjudicatory or criminal jurisdiction.
6 Part 10. LICENSING
7 A. 1. Except as provided in paragraph 6 of Part 3 of this

21 based; provided, the TCA may extend the period in which the license
22 is valid for a reasonable time pending the outcome of any

ENGR. S. B. NO. 585 Page 46

1 unre asonable, it may seek resolution of that issue pursuant to Part
2 11 12 of this Compact.
3 3. The application process shall require the TCA to obtain
4 sufficient information and identification from the applicant to
5 permit a background investigation to determine if a license should

3 4. Upon obtaining the required initial information from a
4 prospective covered game employee, the TCA shall forward a copy of

6 respect to the issuance or denial of a temporary or permanent
7 license. The SCA may conduct its own background investigation of
8 the applicant at SCA expense, shall notify the TCA of such
9 investigation within a reasonable time from initiation of the
10 investigation, and shall provide a written report to the TCA of the
11 outcome of such investigation within a reasonable time from the

19 in this Part, provided the TCA or enterprise is not in possession of
20 information to the contrary. The temporary license shall expire at
21 the end of the ninety-day period or upon issuance or denial of a
22 permanent license, whichever event occurs first. Provided that the
23 temporary license period may be extended at the discretion of the
24 TCA so long as good faith efforts are being made by the applicant to

3 provided further that in the course of such temporary or extended
4 temporary licensing period, no information has come to the attention
5 of the TCA which, in the absence of countervailing information then
6 in the record, would otherwise require denial of license. A
7 permanent license shall be issued or denied within a reasonable time
8 following the completion of the applicant’s background
9 investigation.
10 6. In covered gaming the tribe shall not employ and shall
11 terminate, and the TCA shall not license and shall revoke a license

14 to any covered games or other gaming activity,
15 b. has knowingly and willfully provided false material,
16 statements or information on his or her employment
17 application, or

5 this subsection A of this Part. Such objection shall be in writing
6 setting forth the basis of the objection. The SCA inspector’s work
7 papers, notes and exhibits which formed the SCA conclusion shall be
8 available upon reasonable notice for TCA review. The enterprise
9 shall have discretion to employ an individual over the objection of
10 the SCA.
11 8. The TCA shall have the discretion to initiate or continue a
12 background investigation of any licensee or license applicant and to
13 take appropriate action with respect to the issuance or continued
14 validity of any license at any time, including suspending or
15 revoking such license.
16 9. The TCA shall require all covered game employees to wear, in
17 plain view, identification cards issued by the TCA which include a
18 photograph of the employee, his or her first name, a four-digit
19 identification number unique to the license issued to the employee,

13 2. Background investigations and licensing shall follow the
14 same process and apply the same criteria as for covered game
15 employees set forth in paragraph 6 of subsection A of this Part.
16 3. In the case of a license application of any entity, all
17 principals thereof shall be subjected to the same background
18 investigation required for the licensing of a covered game employee,
19 but no license as such need be issued; provided, no license shall be
20 issued to the entity if the TCA determines that one or more of its
21 principals will be persons who would not be qualified to receive a
22 license if they applied as covered game employees.
23 4. Nothing herein shall prohibit the TCA from processing and
24 issuing a license to a principal in his or her own name.
ENGR. S. B. NO. 585 Page 51

2 least every two (2) years for continuing compliance, and shall be

6 or entity to update all information provided in the previous
7 application.
8 6. The enterprise shall not enter into, or continue to make

13 denied, or whose license has expired or been suspended or revoked.
14 7. Pursuant to 25 C.F.R., Part 533, all management contracts

16 Commission. The SCA shall be notified promptly after any such
17 approval.
18 8. In addition to any licensing criteria set forth above, if
19 any person or entity seeking licensing under this subsection is to
20 receive any fee or other payment based on the revenues or profits of
21 the enterprise, the TCA may take into account whether or not such
22 fee or other payment is fair in light of market conditions and
23 practices.

3 Part 11. EXCLUSIVITY AND FEES
4 A. The parties acknowledge and recognize that this Compact
5 provides tribes with substantial exclusivity and, consistent with
6 the goals of IGRA, special opportunities for tribal economic
7 opportunity through gaming within the external boundaries of
8 Oklahoma in respect to the covered games. In consideration thereof,
9 so long as the state does not change its laws after the effective
10 date of this Compact to permit the operation of any additional form
11 of gaming by any such organization licensee, or change its laws to
12 permit any additional electronic or machine gaming within Oklahoma,
13 the tribe agrees to pay the following fees:
14 1. The tribe covenants and agrees to pay to the state a fee
15 derived from covered game revenues calculated as set forth in
16 paragraph 2 of this subsection. Such fee shall be paid no later
17 than the twentieth day of the month for revenues received by the
18 tribe in the preceding month; and
19 2. The fee shall be:
20 a. four percent (4%) of the first Ten Million Dollars
21 ($10,000,000.00) of adjusted gross revenues received
22 by a tribe in a calendar year from the play of
23 electronic amusement games, electronic bonanza-style
24 bingo games and electronic instant bingo games,
ENGR. S. B. NO. 585 Page 55

1 b. five percent (5%) of the next Ten Million Dollars
2 ($10,000,000.00) of adjusted gross revenues received
3 by a tribe in a calendar year from the play of
4 electronic amusement games, electronic bonanza-style
5 bingo games and electronic instant bingo games,
6 c. six percent (6%) of all subsequent adjusted gross
7 revenues received by a tribe in a calendar year from
8 the play of electronic amusement games, electronic
9 bonanza-style bingo games and electronic instant bingo
10 games, and
11 d. ten percent (10%) of the monthly net win of the common
12 pool(s) or pot(s) from which prizes are paid for
13 nonhouse-banked card games. The tribe is entitled to
14 keep an amount equal to state payments from the common
15 pool(s) or pot(s) as part of its cost of operating the
16 games.
17 Payments of such fees shall be made to the Treasurer of the
18 State of Oklahoma. Nothing Except as provided in Section 4 of this
19 act, nothing herein shall require the allocation of such fees to
20 particular state purposes, including, but not limited to, the actual
21 costs of performing the state’s regulatory responsibilities
22 hereunder.
23 B. Annual oversight assessment. In addition to the fee
24 provided for in subsection A of this Part, the state shall be
ENGR. S. B. NO. 585 Page 56

1 enti tled to payment for its costs incurred in connection with the
2 oversight of covered games to the extent provided herein, “annual
3 oversight assessment”. The annual oversight assessment, which shall
4 be Thirty-five Thousand Dollars ($35,000.00), shall be determined
5 and paid in advance on a fiscal year basis for each twelve (12)
6 months ending on June 30 of each year.
7 C. Upon the effective date of this Compact, the tribe shall
8 deposit with the SCA the sum of Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000.00)
9 (“start-up assessment”). The purpose of the start-up assessment
10 shall be to assist the state in initiating its administrative and
11 oversight responsibilities hereunder and shall be a one-time payment
12 to the state for such purposes.
13 D. Nothing in this Compact shall be deemed to authorize the
14 state to impose any tax, fee, charge or assessment upon the tribe or
15 enterprise except as expressly authorized pursuant to this Compact;
16 provided that, to the extent that the tribe is required under
17 federal law to report prizes awarded, the tribe agrees to copy such
18 reports to the SCA.
19 E. In consideration for the covenants and agreements contained
20 herein, the state agrees that it will not, during the term of this
21 Compact, permit the nontribal operation of any machines or devices
22 to play covered games or electronic or mechanical gaming devices
23 otherwise presently prohibited by law within the state in excess of
24 the number and outside of the designated locations authorized by the
ENGR. S. B. NO. 585 Page 57

1 Stat e-Tribal Gaming Act. The state recognizes the importance of
2 this provision to the tribe and agrees, in the event of a breach of
3 this provision by the state, to require any nontribal entity which
4 operates any such devices or machines in excess of such number or
5 outside of the designated location to remit to the state at least
6 quarterly no less than fifty percent (50%) of any increase in the
7 entities’ adjusted gross revenues following the addition of such
8 excess machines. The state further agrees to remit at least
9 quarterly to eligible tribes, as liquidated damages, a sum equal to
10 fifty percent (50%) of any increase in the entities’ adjusted gross
11 revenues following the addition of such excess machines. For
12 purposes of this Part, “eligible tribes” means those tribes which
13 have entered into this Compact and are operating gaming pursuant to
14 this Compact within forty-five (45) miles of an entity which is
15 operating covered game machines in excess of the number authorized
16 by, or outside of the location designated by, the State-Tribal
17 Gaming Act. Such liquidated damages shall be allocated pro rata to
18 eligible tribes based on the number of covered game machines
19 operated by each Eligible Tribe in the time period when such
20 adjusted gross revenues were generated.
21 F. In consideration for the covenants and agreements contained
22 herein, the tribe agrees that in the event it has currently or
23 locates in the future a facility within a radius of twenty (20)
24 miles from a recipient licensee as that term is defined in
ENGR. S. B. NO. 585 Page 58

1 subs ection K of Section 263 of this title that it shall comply with
2 the requirements of subsection K of Section 263 of this title.
3 Part 12. DISPUTE RESOLUTION
4 In the event that either party to this Compact believes that the
5 other party has failed to comply with any requirement of this
6 Compact, or in the event of any dispute hereunder, including, but
7 not limited to, a dispute over the proper interpretation of the
8 terms and conditions of this Compact, the following procedures may
9 be invoked:
10 1. The goal of the parties shall be to resolve all disputes
11 amicably and voluntarily whenever possible. A party asserting
12 noncompliance or seeking an interpretation of this Compact first
13 shall serve written notice on the other party. The notice shall
14 identify the specific Compact provision alleged to have been
15 violated or in dispute and shall specify in detail the asserting
16 party’s contention and any factual basis for the claim.
17 Representatives of the tribe and state shall meet within thirty (30)
18 days of receipt of notice in an effort to resolve the dispute;
19 2. Subject to the limitation set forth in paragraph 3 of this
20 Part, either party may refer a dispute arising under this Compact to
21 arbitration under the rules of the American Arbitration Association
22 (AAA), subject to enforcement or pursuant to review as provided by
23 paragraph 3 of this Part by a federal district court. The remedies
24 available through arbitration are limited to enforcement of the
ENGR. S. B. NO. 585 Page 59

1 prov isions of this Compact. The parties consent to the jurisdiction
2 of such arbitration forum and court for such limited purposes and no
3 other, and each waives immunity with respect thereto. One
4 arbitrator shall be chosen by the parties from a list of qualified
5 arbitrators to be provided by the AAA. If the parties cannot agree
6 on an arbitrator, then the arbitrator shall be named by the AAA.
7 The expenses of arbitration shall be borne equally by the parties.
8 A party asserting noncompliance or seeking an interpretation of
9 this Compact under this section shall be deemed to have certified
10 that to the best of the party’s knowledge, information, and belief
11 formed after reasonable inquiry, the claim of noncompliance or the
12 request for interpretation of this Compact is warranted and made in
13 good faith and not for any improper purpose, such as to harass or to
14 cause unnecessary delay or the needless incurring of the cost of
15 resolving the dispute. If the dispute is found to have been
16 initiated in violation of this Part, the Arbitrator, upon request or
17 upon his or her own initiative, shall impose upon the violating
18 party an appropriate sanction, which may include an award to the
19 other party of its reasonable expenses incurred in having to
20 participate in the arbitration; and
21 3. Notwithstanding any provision of law, either party to the
22 Compact may bring an action against the other in a federal district
23 court for the de novo review of any arbitration award under
24 paragraph 2 of this Part. The decision of the court shall be
ENGR. S. B. NO. 585 Page 60

1 subj ect to appeal. Each of the parties hereto waives immunity and
2 consents to suit therein for such limited purposes, and agrees not
3 to raise the Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution or
4 comparable defense to the validity of such waiver.
5 Nothing herein shall be construed to authorize a money judgment
6 other than for damages for failure to comply with an arbitration
7 decision requiring the payment of monies.
8 Part 13. CONSTRUCTION OF COMPACT; FEDERAL APPROVAL
9 A. Each provision, section, and subsection of this Compact
10 shall stand separate and independent of every other provision,
11 section, or subsection. In the event that a federal district court
12 shall find any provision, section, or subsection of this Compact to
13 be invalid, the remaining provisions, sections, and subsections of
14 this Compact shall remain in full force and effect, unless the
15 invalidated provision, section or subsection is material.
16 B. Each party hereto agrees to defend the validity of this
17 Compact and the legislation in which it is embodied. This Compact
18 shall constitute a binding agreement between the parties and shall

7 standards are changed by amendment of the State-Tribal Gaming Act,
8 the tribe shall have the option to incorporate said changes into
9 this Compact by delivery of written notice of said changes to the
