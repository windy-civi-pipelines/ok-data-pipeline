various types of property owners, businesses, and governmental
9
10
entities. Except where such modification or variance is prohibited
10
11
by statutory or constitutional constraints, if the Authority finds

its proposal to exclude the activity that may potentially cause such
21
22
adverse effects; and
22
23
6. When the Authority provides notice pursuant to paragraph 1
