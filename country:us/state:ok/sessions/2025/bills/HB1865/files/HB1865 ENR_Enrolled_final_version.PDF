2022 (26 O.S. Supp. 2024, Section 6-104.1), is amended to read as
follows:
Section 6-104.1. A. All ballots used for any election shall be
printed on paper to ensure a fair and accurate count; provided, each
precinct polling place and in-person absentee voting location shall
provide a means for any voter who requires assistance by reason of
blindness, disability, or inability to read or write to cast a
ballot privately and independently, in a manner to be determined by
the Secretary of the State Election Board.

B. 1. Ballots for each election day precinct shall be printed
in advance of the date of the election. Provided, the Secretary of
the State Election Board may authorize the printing of additional
ballots on election day in the event of a ballot shortage or due to
an emergency or unforeseen circumstance as described in Section 22-
101 of this title.
2. Nothing in this subsection shall prohibit the printing or
marking of ballots for persons with blindness, disability, or
inability to read or write as provided in subsection A of this
section.
SECTION 2. AMENDATORY 26 O.S. 2021, Section 7-104, is
amended to read as follows:
Section 7-104. A. At every Primary, Runoff Primary and General
Election and any other election conducted by a county election
board, each polling place in the state shall open at 7:00 a.m. and
shall remain open continuously until 7:00 p.m., and every registered
voter of a precinct who presents himself or herself between said
hours shall be entitled to vote, as provided by law, provided
further, all qualified voters who are in line waiting to vote at
7:00 p.m. shall be allowed to vote.
B. 1. A registered voter wishing to vote on election day shall
appear at the polling place for his or her assigned precinct.

exception to this requirement may be authorized for a county
election board by the Secretary of the State Election Board in the

The emergency use of a countywide vote center must be limited to the
precincts directly impacted by the emergency.
3. Nothing in this subsection shall prohibit the use of
subprecincts as described in Section 3-119 of this title, nor shall
it prohibit the assignment of precinct officials to serve more than
one precinct, if authorized by law, if the precincts share the same
election day polling place.
