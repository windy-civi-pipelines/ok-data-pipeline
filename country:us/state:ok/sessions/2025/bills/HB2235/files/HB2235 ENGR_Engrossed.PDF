ENGR. H. B. NO. 2235 Page 1

1 Section 19. A. Any person qualified under Section 18 of this
2 title may petition the district court of the district in which the
3 arrest information pertaining to the person is located for the
4 sealing of all or any part of the record, except basic
5 identification information.
6 B. The process for the automatic expungement of a clean slate
7 eligible arrest record as defined in subsection C of Section 18 of
8 this title is as follows:
9 1. On a monthly basis, the Oklahoma State Bureau of
10 Investigation shall identify arrest records which are clean slate
11 eligible by conducting a search of the criminal history repository
12 records of the Bureau;
13 2. The Bureau shall, on a monthly basis, provide a list of
14 clean slate eligible arrest records to the prosecuting agency and
15 the arresting agency;
16 3. The prosecuting agency, arresting agency, and the Bureau
17 may, no later than forty-five (45) days from the day on which the
18 notice described in paragraph 2 of this subsection is transmitted,
19 object to an automatic expungement and such objection shall be
20 transmitted to all parties. An objection may be made for any of the
21 following reasons:
22 a. after reviewing the agency record, the agency believes
23 the arrest record does not meet the definition of a
24 clean slate eligible arrest record,
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2235 Page 2

1 b. the individual has not paid court-ordered restitution
2 to the victim, or
3 c. the agency has a reasonable belief, grounded in
4 supporting facts, that an individual with a clean
5 slate eligible arrest record is continuing to engage
6 in criminal activity, whether charged or not charged,
7 within or outside the state;
8 4. If an agency identified in paragraph 3 of this subsection
9 objects for a reason described in paragraph 3 of this subsection
10 within forty-five (45) days of the day on which the notice described
11 in paragraph 2 of this subsection is transmitted, the record shall
12 not be expunged. Once a year, the Bureau shall electronically
13 submit a report to the Legislature with a list of all cases where a
14 record was not expunged pursuant to this paragraph; and
15 5. After forty-five (45) days pass from the day on which the
16 notice described in paragraph 2 of this subsection is sent, the
17 Bureau shall provide to the courts a list of all cases where
18 responses from all parties were received and no parties objected.
19 The court shall review this list and provide to all agencies that
20 have criminal history records a signed expungement order for all
21 cases approved. Upon receipt of a signed expungement order, each
22 agency shall seal the relevant records.

24
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2235 Page 3

1 The Bureau and the Supreme Court may promulgate rules to govern
2 the process for automatic expungement of records for a clean slate
3 eligible arrest record in accordance with this subsection.
4 C. 1. Nothing in this section precludes an individual from
5 filing a petition for expungement of records that are eligible for
6 automatic expungement under subsection C of Section 18 of this title
7 if an automatic expungement has not occurred pursuant to subsection
8 B of this section.
9 2. An individual does not have a cause of action for damages as
10 a result of the failure of the Bureau to identify an arrest record
11 as eligible for automatic expungement.
12 D. An automatic expungement granted under subsection B of this
13 section does not preclude an individual from requesting the
14 unsealing of records in accordance with subsection P of this
15 section.
16 E. Upon the filing of a petition or entering of a court order
17 as prescribed in subsection A of this section, the court shall set a
18 date for a hearing and shall provide thirty (30) days of notice of
19 the hearing to the prosecuting agency, the arresting agency, the
20 Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation, and any other person or
21 agency whom the court has reason to believe may have relevant
22 information related to the sealing of such record.
23 F. If a petitioner requests expungement for multiple offenses
24 in one county, each of which would qualify for expungement if
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2235 Page 4

1 proc essed sequentially, the expungements may be considered under a
2 single petition. The petitioner shall not be required to submit
3 multiple petitions to accomplish the sequential sealing of multiple
4 offenses in a single county.
5 G. Upon a finding that the harm to privacy of the person in
6 interest or dangers of unwarranted adverse consequences outweigh the
7 public interest in retaining the records, the court may order such
8 records, or any part thereof except basic identification
9 information, to be sealed. If the court finds that neither sealing
10 of the records nor maintaining of the records unsealed by the agency
11 would serve the ends of justice, the court may enter an appropriate
12 order limiting access to such records.
13 Any order entered under this subsection shall specify those
14 agencies to which such order shall apply. Any order entered
15 pursuant to this subsection may be appealed by the petitioner, the
16 prosecuting agency, the arresting agency, or the Oklahoma State
17 Bureau of Investigation to the Supreme Court in accordance with the
18 rules of the Supreme Court. In all such appeals, the Oklahoma State
19 Bureau of Investigation is a necessary party and must be given
20 notice of the appellate proceedings.
21 H. Upon the entry of an order to seal the records, or any part
22 thereof, or upon an automatic expungement described in subsection B
23 of this section, the subject official actions shall be deemed never
24 to have occurred, and the person in interest and all criminal
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2235 Page 5

1 just ice agencies may properly reply, upon any inquiry in the matter,
2 that no such action ever occurred and that no such record exists
3 with respect to such person.
4 I. Inspection of the records included in the order may
5 thereafter be permitted by the court only upon petition by the
6 person in interest who is the subject of such records, the Attorney
7 General, or by the prosecuting agency and only to those persons and
8 for such purposes named in such petition.
9 J. Employers, educational institutions, state and local
10 government agencies, officials, and employees shall not, in any
11 application or interview or otherwise, require an applicant to
12 disclose any information contained in sealed records. An applicant
13 need not, in answer to any question concerning arrest and criminal
14 records, provide information that has been sealed, including any
15 reference to or information concerning such sealed information and
16 may state that no such action has ever occurred. Such an
17 application may not be denied solely because of the refusal of the
18 applicant to disclose arrest and criminal records information that
19 has been sealed.
20 K. All arrest and criminal records information existing prior
21 to May 14, 1987, except basic identification information, is also
22 subject to sealing in accordance with subsection G of this section.
23 L. Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize the
24 physical destruction of any criminal justice records.
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2235 Page 6

1 M. For the purposes of this section, sealed materials which are
2 recorded in the same document as unsealed material may be recorded
3 in a separate document, and sealed, then obliterated in the original
4 document.
5 N. For the purposes of this section, district court index
6 reference of sealed material shall be destroyed, removed or
7 obliterated.
8 O. Any record ordered to be sealed pursuant to this section, if
9 not unsealed within ten (10) years of the expungement order, may be
10 obliterated or destroyed at the end of the ten-year period.
11 P. Subsequent to records being sealed as provided herein, the
12 prosecuting agency, the arresting agency, the Oklahoma State Bureau
13 of Investigation, or other interested person or agency may petition
14 the court for an order unsealing such records. Upon filing of a
15 petition, the court shall set a date for hearing, which hearing may
16 be closed at the discretion of the court, and shall provide thirty
17 (30) days of notice to all interested parties. If, upon hearing,
18 the court determines there has been a change of conditions or that
19 there is a compelling reason to unseal the records, the court may
20 order all or a portion of the records unsealed.
21 Q. Nothing herein shall prohibit the introduction of evidence
22 regarding actions sealed pursuant to the provisions of this section
23 at any hearing or trial for purposes of impeaching the credibility
24
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2235 Page 7

1 of a witness or as evidence of character testimony pursuant to
2 Section 2608 of Title 12 of the Oklahoma Statutes.
3 R. If a person qualifies for an expungement under the
4 provisions of paragraph 3 of subsection A of Section 18 of this
5 title and the petition for expungement is granted by the court, the
6 court shall order the reimbursement of all filing fees and court
7 costs incurred by the petitioner as a result of filing the
8 expungement request.
9 S. If a person qualifies for an expungement under the
10 provisions of paragraph 3 or 4 of subsection A of Section 18 of this
11 title, the person may request a hearing be set within thirty (30)
12 days after the date of filing the petition for expungement. The
13 court shall grant the request for the hearing and shall provide a
14 notice of no less than ten (10) days for said hearing to the
15 prosecuting agency, the arresting agency, the Oklahoma State Bureau
16 of Investigation, and any other person or agency whom the court has
17 reason to believe may have relevant information related to the
18 sealing of such record. Any order entered pursuant to the
19 provisions of this subsection shall be subject to the provisions of
20 subsections F through P of this section.
21 T. Any offense that has been expunged shall not be treated as a
22 prior offense in determining whether another offense qualifies for
23 an expungement under Section 18 of this title.
