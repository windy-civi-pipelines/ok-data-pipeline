2 SECTION 1. AMENDATORY 22 O.S. 2021, Section 19, as last
3 amended by Section 2, Chapter 259, O.S.L. 2024 (22 O.S. Supp. 2024,
4 Section 19), is amended to read as follows:
5 Section 19. A. Any person qualified under Section 18 of this
6 title may petition the district court of the district in which the
7 arrest information pertaining to the person is located for the
8 sealing of all or any part of the record, except basic
9 identification information.
10 B. The process for the automatic expungement of a clean slate
11 eligible arrest record as defined in subsection C of Section 18 of
12 this title is as follows:
13 1. On a monthly basis, the Oklahoma State Bureau of
14 Investigation shall identify arrest records which are clean slate
15 eligible by conducting a search of the criminal history repository
16 records of the Bureau;
17 2. The Bureau shall, on a monthly basis, provide a list of
18 clean slate eligible arrest records to the prosecuting agency and
19 the arresting agency;
20 3. The prosecuting agency, arresting agency, and the Bureau
21 may, no later than forty-five (45) days from the day on which the
22 notice described in paragraph 2 of this subsection is transmitted,
23 object to an automatic expungement and such objection shall be
24
HB2235 HFLR Page 2
BOLD FACE denotes Committee Amendments.
1 tran smitted to all parties. An objection may be made for any of the
2 following reasons:
3 a. after reviewing the agency record, the agency believes
4 the arrest record does not meet the definition of a
5 clean slate eligible arrest record,
6 b. the individual has not paid court-ordered restitution
7 to the victim, or
8 c. the agency has a reasonable belief, grounded in
9 supporting facts, that an individual with a clean
10 slate eligible arrest record is continuing to engage
11 in criminal activity, whether charged or not charged,
12 within or outside the state;
13 4. If an agency identified in paragraph 3 of this subsection
14 objects for a reason described in paragraph 3 of this subsection
15 within forty-five (45) days of the day on which the notice described
16 in paragraph 2 of this subsection is transmitted, the record shall
17 not be expunged. Once a year, the Bureau shall electronically
18 submit a report to the Legislature with a list of all cases where a
19 record was not expunged pursuant to this paragraph; and
20 5. After forty-five (45) days pass from the day on which the
21 notice described in paragraph 2 of this subsection is sent, the
22 Bureau shall provide to the courts a list of all cases where
23 responses from all parties were received and no parties objected.
24 The court shall review this list and provide to all agencies that
HB2235 HFLR Page 3
BOLD FACE denotes Committee Amendments.
1 have criminal history records a signed expungement order for all
2 cases approved. Upon receipt of a signed expungement order, each
3 agency shall seal the relevant records.
4 The Bureau and the Supreme Court may promulgate rules to govern
5 the process for automatic expungement of records for a clean slate
6 eligible arrest record in accordance with this subsection.
7 C. 1. Nothing in this section precludes an individual from
8 filing a petition for expungement of records that are eligible for
9 automatic expungement under subsection C of Section 18 of this title
10 if an automatic expungement has not occurred pursuant to subsection
11 B of this section.
12 2. An individual does not have a cause of action for damages as
13 a result of the failure of the Bureau to identify an arrest record
14 as eligible for automatic expungement.
15 D. An automatic expungement granted under subsection B of this
16 section does not preclude an individual from requesting the
17 unsealing of records in accordance with subsection P of this
18 section.
19 E. Upon the filing of a petition or entering of a court order
20 as prescribed in subsection A of this section, the court shall set a
21 date for a hearing and shall provide thirty (30) days of notice of
22 the hearing to the prosecuting agency, the arresting agency, the
23 Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation, and any other person or
24
HB2235 HFLR Page 4
BOLD FACE denotes Committee Amendments.
1 agen cy whom the court has reason to believe may have relevant
2 information related to the sealing of such record.
3 F. If a petitioner requests expungement for multiple offenses
4 in one county, each of which would qualify for expungement if
5 processed sequentially, the expungements may be considered under a
6 single petition. The petitioner shall not be required to submit
7 multiple petitions to accomplish the sequential sealing of multiple
8 offenses in a single county.
9 G. Upon a finding that the harm to privacy of the person in
10 interest or dangers of unwarranted adverse consequences outweigh the
11 public interest in retaining the records, the court may order such
12 records, or any part thereof except basic identification
13 information, to be sealed. If the court finds that neither sealing
14 of the records nor maintaining of the records unsealed by the agency
15 would serve the ends of justice, the court may enter an appropriate
16 order limiting access to such records.
17 Any order entered under this subsection shall specify those
18 agencies to which such order shall apply. Any order entered
19 pursuant to this subsection may be appealed by the petitioner, the
20 prosecuting agency, the arresting agency, or the Oklahoma State
21 Bureau of Investigation to the Supreme Court in accordance with the
22 rules of the Supreme Court. In all such appeals, the Oklahoma State
23 Bureau of Investigation is a necessary party and must be given
24 notice of the appellate proceedings.

1 H. Upon the entry of an order to seal the records, or any part
2 thereof, or upon an automatic expungement described in subsection B
3 of this section, the subject official actions shall be deemed never
4 to have occurred, and the person in interest and all criminal
5 justice agencies may properly reply, upon any inquiry in the matter,
6 that no such action ever occurred and that no such record exists
7 with respect to such person.
8 I. Inspection of the records included in the order may
9 thereafter be permitted by the court only upon petition by the
10 person in interest who is the subject of such records, the Attorney
11 General, or by the prosecuting agency and only to those persons and
12 for such purposes named in such petition.
13 J. Employers, educational institutions, state and local
14 government agencies, officials, and employees shall not, in any
15 application or interview or otherwise, require an applicant to
16 disclose any information contained in sealed records. An applicant
17 need not, in answer to any question concerning arrest and criminal
18 records, provide information that has been sealed, including any
19 reference to or information concerning such sealed information and
20 may state that no such action has ever occurred. Such an
21 application may not be denied solely because of the refusal of the
22 applicant to disclose arrest and criminal records information that
23 has been sealed.

11 reference of sealed material shall be destroyed, removed or
12 obliterated.
13 O. Any record ordered to be sealed pursuant to this section, if
14 not unsealed within ten (10) years of the expungement order, may be
15 obliterated or destroyed at the end of the ten-year period.
16 P. Subsequent to records being sealed as provided herein, the
17 prosecuting agency, the arresting agency, the Oklahoma State Bureau
18 of Investigation, or other interested person or agency may petition
19 the court for an order unsealing such records. Upon filing of a
20 petition, the court shall set a date for hearing, which hearing may
21 be closed at the discretion of the court, and shall provide thirty
22 (30) days of notice to all interested parties. If, upon hearing,
23 the court determines there has been a change of conditions or that
24

20 prosecuting agency, the arresting agency, the Oklahoma State Bureau
21 of Investigation, and any other person or agency whom the court has
22 reason to believe may have relevant information related to the
23 sealing of such record. Any order entered pursuant to the
24
HB2235 HFLR Page 8
BOLD FACE denotes Committee Amendments.
1 prov isions of this subsection shall be subject to the provisions of
2 subsections F through P of this section.
3 T. Any offense that has been expunged shall not be treated as a
4 prior offense in determining whether another offense qualifies for
5 an expungement under Section 18 of this title.

24 The court shall review this list and provide to all agencies that

1 have criminal history records a signed expungement order for all
2 cases approved. Upon receipt of a signed expungement order, each
3 agency shall seal the relevant records.
4 The Bureau and the Supreme Court may promulgate rules to govern
5 the process for automatic expungement of records for a clean slate
6 eligible arrest record in accordance with this subsection.
7 C. 1. Nothing in this section precludes an individual from
8 filing a petition for expungement of records that are eligible for
9 automatic expungement under subsection C of Section 18 of this title
10 if an automatic expungement has not occurred pursuant to subsection
11 B of this section.
12 2. An individual does not have a cause of action for damages as
13 a result of the failure of the Bureau to identify an arrest record
14 as eligible for automatic expungement.
15 D. An automatic expungement granted under subsection B of this
16 section does not preclude an individual from requesting the
17 unsealing of records in accordance with subsection P of this
18 section.
19 E. Upon the filing of a petition or entering of a court order
20 as prescribed in subsection A of this section, the court shall set a

7 multiple petitions to accomplish the sequential sealing of multiple
8 offenses in a single county.
9 G. Upon a finding that the harm to privacy of the person in
10 interest or dangers of unwarranted adverse consequences outweigh the
11 public interest in retaining the records, the court may order such
12 records, or any part thereof except basic identification
13 information, to be sealed. If the court finds that neither sealing
14 of the records nor maintaining of the records unsealed by the agency
15 would serve the ends of justice, the court may enter an appropriate
16 order limiting access to such records.
17 Any order entered under this subsection shall specify those
18 agencies to which such order shall apply. Any order entered
19 pursuant to this subsection may be appealed by the petitioner, the
20 prosecuting agency, the arresting agency, or the Oklahoma State
21 Bureau of Investigation to the Supreme Court in accordance with the
22 rules of the Supreme Court. In all such appeals, the Oklahoma State
23 Bureau of Investigation is a necessary party and must be given
24 notice of the appellate proceedings.

5 justice agencies may properly reply, upon any inquiry in the matter,
6 that no such action ever occurred and that no such record exists
7 with respect to such person.
8 I. Inspection of the records included in the order may
9 thereafter be permitted by the court only upon petition by the
10 person in interest who is the subject of such records, the Attorney
11 General, or by the prosecuting agency and only to those persons and
12 for such purposes named in such petition.
13 J. Employers, educational institutions, state and local
14 government agencies, officials, and employees shall not, in any

17 need not, in answer to any question concerning arrest and criminal
18 records, provide information that has been sealed, including any
19 reference to or information concerning such sealed information and
20 may state that no such action has ever occurred. Such an
21 application may not be denied solely because of the refusal of the
22 applicant to disclose arrest and criminal records information that
23 has been sealed.

17 prosecuting agency, the arresting agency, the Oklahoma State Bureau
18 of Investigation, or other interested person or agency may petition
19 the court for an order unsealing such records. Upon filing of a
20 petition, the court shall set a date for hearing, which hearing may
21 be closed at the discretion of the court, and shall provide thirty
22 (30) days of notice to all interested parties. If, upon hearing,
