1 B. The process for the automatic expungement of a clean slate
2 eligible arrest record as defined in subsection C of Section 18 of
3 this title is as follows:
4 1. On a monthly basis, the Oklahoma State Bureau of
5 Investigation shall identify arrest records which are clean slate

8 2. The Bureau shall, on a monthly basis, provide a list of
9 clean slate eligible arrest records to the prosecuting agency and
10 the arresting agency;
11 3. The prosecuting agency, arresting agency, and the Bureau
12 may, no later than forty-five (45) days from the day on which the
13 notice described in paragraph 2 of this subsection is transmitted,
14 object to an automatic expungement and such objection shall be
15 transmitted to all parties. An objection may be made for any of the
16 following reasons:
17 a. after reviewing the agency record, the agency believes
18 the arrest record does not meet the definition of a
19 clean slate eligible arrest record,
20 b. the individual has not paid court-ordered restitution
21 to the victim, or
22 c. the agency has a reasonable belief, grounded in
23 supporting facts, that an individual with a clean

SENATE FLOOR VERSION - HB2235 SFLR Page 2
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)

1 in criminal activity, whether charged or not charged,
2 within or outside the state;
3 4. If an agency identified in paragraph 3 of this subsection
4 objects for a reason described in paragraph 3 of this subsection
5 within forty-five (45) days of the day on which the notice described
6 in paragraph 2 of this subsection is transmitted, the record shall
7 not be expunged. Once a year, the Bureau shall electronically
8 submit a report to the Legislature with a list of all cases where a
9 record was not expunged pursuant to this paragraph; and
10 5. After forty-five (45) days pass from the day on which the
11 notice described in paragraph 2 of this subsection is sent, the
12 Bureau shall provide to the courts a list of all cases where
13 responses from all parties were received and no parties objected.
14 The court shall review this list and provide to all agencies that
15 have criminal history records a signed expungement order for all
16 cases approved. Upon receipt of a signed expungement order, each
17 agency shall seal the relevant records.
18 The Bureau and the Supreme Court may promulgate rules to govern
19 the process for automatic expungement of records for a clean slate

22 filing a petition for expungement of records that are eligible for
23 automatic expungement under subsection C of Section 18 of this title
24
SENATE FLOOR VERSION - HB2235 SFLR Page 3
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)

1 if a n automatic expungement has not occurred pursuant to subsection
2 B of this section.
3 2. An individual does not have a cause of action for damages as
4 a result of the failure of the Bureau to identify an arrest record
5 as eligible for automatic expungement.
6 D. An automatic expungement granted under subsection B of this
7 section does not preclude an individual from requesting the
8 unsealing of records in accordance with subsection P of this
9 section.
10 E. Upon the filing of a petition or entering of a court order
11 as prescribed in subsection A of this section, the court shall set a
12 date for a hearing and shall provide thirty (30) days of notice of
13 the hearing to the prosecuting agency, the arresting agency, the
14 Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation, and any other person or
15 agency whom the court has reason to believe may have relevant
16 information related to the sealing of such record.
17 F. If a petitioner requests expungement for multiple offenses
18 in one county, each of which would qualify for expungement if
19 processed sequentially, the expungements may be considered under a
20 single petition. The petitioner shall not be required to submit
21 multiple petitions to accomplish the sequential sealing of multiple
22 offenses in a single county.
23 G. Upon a finding that the harm to privacy of the person in
24 interest or dangers of unwarranted adverse consequences outweigh the
SENATE FLOOR VERSION - HB2235 SFLR Page 4
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)

1 publ ic interest in retaining the records, the court may order such
2 records, or any part thereof except basic identification
3 information, to be sealed. If the court finds that neither sealing
4 of the records nor maintaining of the records unsealed by the agency
5 would serve the ends of justice, the court may enter an appropriate
6 order limiting access to such records.
7 Any order entered under this subsection shall specify those
8 agencies to which such order shall apply. Any order entered
9 pursuant to this subsection may be appealed by the petitioner, the
10 prosecuting agency, the arresting agency, or the Oklahoma State
11 Bureau of Investigation to the Supreme Court in accordance with the
12 rules of the Supreme Court. In all such appeals, the Oklahoma State
13 Bureau of Investigation is a necessary party and must be given
14 notice of the appellate proceedings.
15 H. Upon the entry of an order to seal the records, or any part
16 thereof, or upon an automatic expungement described in subsection B
17 of this section, the subject official actions shall be deemed never
18 to have occurred, and the person in interest and all criminal
19 justice agencies may properly reply, upon any inquiry in the matter,
20 that no such action ever occurred and that no such record exists
21 with respect to such person.
22 I. Inspection of the records included in the order may
23 thereafter be permitted by the court only upon petition by the
24 person in interest who is the subject of such records, the Attorney
SENATE FLOOR VERSION - HB2235 SFLR Page 5
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)

1 Gene ral, or by the prosecuting agency and only to those persons and
2 for such purposes named in such petition.
3 J. Employers, educational institutions, state and local
4 government agencies, officials, and employees shall not, in any
5 application or interview or otherwise, require an applicant to
6 disclose any information contained in sealed records. An applicant
7 need not, in answer to any question concerning arrest and criminal
8 records, provide information that has been sealed, including any
9 reference to or information concerning such sealed information and
10 may state that no such action has ever occurred. Such an
11 application may not be denied solely because of the refusal of the
12 applicant to disclose arrest and criminal records information that
13 has been sealed.
14 K. All arrest and criminal records information existing prior
15 to May 14, 1987, except basic identification information, is also

8 prosecuting agency, the arresting agency, the Oklahoma State Bureau
9 of Investigation, or other interested person or agency may petition
10 the court for an order unsealing such records. Upon filing of a
11 petition, the court shall set a date for hearing, which hearing may
12 be closed at the discretion of the court, and shall provide thirty
13 (30) days of notice to all interested parties. If, upon hearing,
14 the court determines there has been a change of conditions or that
15 there is a compelling reason to unseal the records, the court may
16 order all or a portion of the records unsealed.
17 Q. Nothing herein shall prohibit the introduction of evidence
18 regarding actions sealed pursuant to the provisions of this section
19 at any hearing or trial for purposes of impeaching the credibility

10 prosecuting agency, the arresting agency, the Oklahoma State Bureau
11 of Investigation, and any other person or agency whom the court has
12 reason to believe may have relevant information related to the
13 sealing of such record. Any order entered pursuant to the
14 provisions of this subsection shall be subject to the provisions of
15 subsections F through P of this section.
16 T. Any offense that has been expunged shall not be treated as a
17 prior offense in determining whether another offense qualifies for
18 an expungement under Section 18 of this title.
