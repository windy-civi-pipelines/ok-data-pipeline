8 emancipated;
9 2. Any minor who is separated from his or her parents or legal

11 parents or guardian;

16 conditions specified in this section. Any health professional who

4 cannot give consent and has no known relatives or legal guardian, if
5 two physicians agree on the health service to be given;
6 7. Any minor in need of emergency services for conditions which
7 will endanger his or her health or life if delay would result by
8 obtaining consent from his or her spouse, parent, or legal guardian;
9 provided, however, that the prescribing of any medicine or device
10 for the prevention of pregnancy shall not be considered such an
11 emergency service; or
12 8. Any minor who is the victim of sexual assault; provided,
13 however, that such self-consent only applies to a forensic medical
14 examination by a qualified licensed health care professional.
15 B. If any minor falsely represents facts that he may would

17 section and a health professional provides health services in good
18 faith based upon that misrepresentation, the minor shall receive
19 full services without the consent of the minor’s parent or legal
20 guardian and the health professional shall incur no liability except
21 for negligence or intentional harm. Consent of the minor shall not
22 be subject to later disaffirmance or revocation because of his or
