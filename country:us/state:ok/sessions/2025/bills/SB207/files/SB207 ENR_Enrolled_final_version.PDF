Section 1-533. A. The State Commissioner of Health shall
provide, pursuant to the provisions of Section 1-534 of this title,
as technologies and funds become available, an intensive educational
and newborn screening program among physicians, hospitals, public
health nurses, and the public concerning phenylketonuria, related
inborn metabolic disorders, and other genetic or biochemical
disorders for which:

Section 22:
1. Newborn screening will provide early treatment and
management opportunities that might not be available without
screening; and

Section 23:
2. Treatment and management will prevent intellectual
disabilities and/or reduce infant morbidity and mortality.
ENR. S. B. NO. 207 Page 5
B. This educational and newborn screening program shall include

C. For purposes of this section, “phenylketonuria” means an

defect in phenylalanine hydroxylase, the enzyme that catalyzes the
conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine. The deficiency permits the
accumulation of phenylalanine and its metabolic products in the body
fluids. The deficiency can result in intellectual disabilities
(phenylpyruvic oligophrenia), neurologic manifestations (including
hyperkinesia, epilepsy, and microcephaly), light pigmentation, and
eczema. The disorder is transmitted as an autosomal recessive trait

published on the Department’s website and shall be submitted
electronically to the President Pro Tempore of the Senate, the
Speaker of the House of Representatives, the Governor, and the
Oklahoma Rare Disease Advisory Council established under Section 1
of this act.
F. The Commissioner shall promulgate any rules necessary to
effectuate the provision of this section.

Section 27:
SECTION 3. This act shall become effective July 1, 2025.
ENR. S. B. NO. 207 Page 6

Section 28:
SECTION 4. It being immediately necessary for the preservation
of the public peace, health or safety, an emergency is hereby
declared to exist, by reason whereof this act shall take effect and
be in full force from and after its passage and approval.
