9 Section 1-533), is amended to read as follows:
10 Section 1-533. A. The State Commissioner of Health shall
11 provide, pursuant to the provisions of Section 1-534 of this title,
12 as technologies and funds become available, an intensive educational
13 and newborn screening program among physicians, hospitals, public
14 health nurses, and the public concerning phenylketonuria, related
15 inborn metabolic disorders, and other genetic or biochemical
16 disorders for which:
17 1. Newborn screening will provide early treatment and
18 management opportunities that might not be available without
19 screening; and
20 2. Treatment and management will prevent intellectual
21 disabilities and/or reduce infant morbidity and mortality.

ENGR. S. B. NO. 207 Page 6

1 2. Examinations for the detection of the diseases in infancy;

3 3. Follow-up measures to prevent the morbidity and mortality
4 resulting from these diseases.
5 C. For purposes of this section, “phenylketonuria” means an
6 inborn error of metabolism attributable to a deficiency of or a
7 defect in phenylalanine hydroxylase, the enzyme that catalyzes the
8 conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine. The deficiency permits the
9 accumulation of phenylalanine and its metabolic products in the body
10 fluids. The deficiency can result in intellectual disabilities
11 (phenylpyruvic oligophrenia), neurologic manifestations (including
12 hyperkinesia, epilepsy, and microcephaly), light pigmentation, and
13 eczema. The disorder is transmitted as an autosomal recessive trait
14 and can be treated by administration of a diet low in phenylalanine.
15 D. To the extent practicable, the list of disorders screened
16 for under this section shall be identical to at a minimum include
17 those listed in the Recommended Uniform Screening Panel of the
18 United States Department of Health and Human Services.
19 E. On November 1, 2026, and each November 1 thereafter, the
20 State Department of Health shall compile an annual report listing
21 the disorders screened for under this section, specifying any
22 disorders added since the prior annual report, and detailing efforts
23 being undertaken to add additional disorders. The report shall be
24 published on the Department’s website and shall be submitted
