provide, pursuant to the provisions of Section 1-534 of this title,
16
17
as technologies and funds become available, an intensive educational
17

and newborn screening program among physicians, hospitals, public
18
19
health nurses, and the public concerning phenylketonuria, related
19
20
inborn metabolic disorders, and other genetic or biochemical
20
21
disorders for which:

disabilities and/or reduce infant morbidity and mortality.

information about:

C. For purposes of this section, “phenylketonuria” means an

11
inborn error of metabolism attributable to a deficiency of or a
11
12
defect in phenylalanine hydroxylase, the enzyme that catalyzes the
12
13
conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine. The deficiency permits the
13
14
accumulation of phenylalanine and its metabolic products in the body
14
15
fluids. The deficiency can result in intellectual disabilities
15
16
(phenylpyruvic oligophrenia), neurologic manifestations (including
16
17
hyperkinesia, epilepsy, and microcephaly), light pigmentation, and
17
18
eczema. The disorder is transmitted as an autosomal recessive trait
18
19
and can be treated by administration of a diet low in phenylalanine.

20
D. To the extent practicable, the list of disorders screened
20
