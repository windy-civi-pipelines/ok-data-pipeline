13 BE IT ENACTED BY THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF OKLAHOMA:
14 SECTION 1. AMENDATORY 68 O.S. 2021, Section 2358, as
15 last amended by Section 155, Chapter 452, O.S.L. 2024 (68 O.S. Supp.
16 2024, Section 2358), is amended to read as follows:
17 Section 2358. For all tax years beginning after December 31,
18 1981, taxable income and adjusted gross income shall be adjusted to
19 arrive at Oklahoma taxable income and Oklahoma adjusted gross income
20 as required by this section.
21 A. The taxable income of any taxpayer shall be adjusted to
22 arrive at Oklahoma taxable income for corporations and Oklahoma
23 adjusted gross income for individuals, as follows:
24

1 1. There shall be added interest income on obligations of any
2 state or political subdivision thereto which is not otherwise
3 exempted pursuant to other laws of this state, to the extent that
4 such interest is not included in taxable income and adjusted gross
5 income.
6 2. There shall be deducted amounts included in such income that
7 the state is prohibited from taxing because of the provisions of the
8 Federal Constitution, the State Constitution, federal laws or laws
9 of Oklahoma.
10 3. The amount of any federal net operating loss deduction shall
11 be adjusted as follows:
12 a. For carryovers and carrybacks to taxable years
13 beginning before January 1, 1981, the amount of any
14 net operating loss deduction allowed to a taxpayer for
15 federal income tax purposes shall be reduced to an
16 amount which is the same portion thereof as the loss
17 from sources within this state, as determined pursuant
18 to this section and Section 2362 of this title, for
19 the taxable year in which such loss is sustained is of
20 the total loss for such year;
21 b. For carryovers and carrybacks to taxable years
22 beginning after December 31, 1980, the amount of any
23 net operating loss deduction allowed for the taxable
24 year shall be an amount equal to the aggregate of the

1 Oklahoma net operating loss carryovers and carrybacks
2 to such year. Oklahoma net operating losses shall be
3 separately determined by reference to Section 172 of
4 the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C., Section 172, as
5 modified by the Oklahoma Income Tax Act, Section 2351
6 et seq. of this title, and shall be allowed without
7 regard to the existence of a federal net operating
8 loss. For tax years beginning after December 31,
9 2000, and ending before January 1, 2008, the years to
10 which such losses may be carried shall be determined
11 solely by reference to Section 172 of the Internal
12 Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C., Section 172, with the
13 exception that the terms "net operating loss" and
14 "taxable income" shall be replaced with "Oklahoma net
15 operating loss" and "Oklahoma taxable income". For
16 tax years beginning after December 31, 2007, and
17 ending before January 1, 2009, years to which such
18 losses may be carried back shall be limited to two (2)
19 years. For tax years beginning after December 31,
20 2008, the years to which such losses may be carried
21 back shall be determined solely by reference to
22 Section 172 of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C.,
23 Section 172, with the exception that the terms "net
24 operating loss" and "taxable income" shall be replaced

1 with "Oklahoma net operating loss" and "Oklahoma
2 taxable income".
3 4. Items of the following nature shall be allocated as
4 indicated. Allowable deductions attributable to items separately
5 allocable in subparagraphs a, b and c of this paragraph, whether or
6 not such items of income were actually received, shall be allocated
7 on the same basis as those items:
8 a. Income from real and tangible personal property, such
9 as rents, oil and mining production or royalties, and
10 gains or losses from sales of such property, shall be
11 allocated in accordance with the situs of such
12 property;
13 b. Income from intangible personal property, such as
14 interest, dividends, patent or copyright royalties,
15 and gains or losses from sales of such property, shall
16 be allocated in accordance with the domiciliary situs
17 of the taxpayer, except that:
18 (1) where such property has acquired a nonunitary
19 business or commercial situs apart from the
20 domicile of the taxpayer such income shall be
21 allocated in accordance with such business or
22 commercial situs; interest income from
23 investments held to generate working capital for
24 a unitary business enterprise shall be included

1 in apportionable income; a resident trust or
2 resident estate shall be treated as having a
3 separate commercial or business situs insofar as
4 undistributed income is concerned, but shall not
5 be treated as having a separate commercial or
6 business situs insofar as distributed income is
7 concerned,
8 (2) for taxable years beginning after December 31,
9 2003, capital or ordinary gains or losses from
10 the sale of an ownership interest in a publicly
11 traded partnership, as defined by Section 7704(b)
12 of the Internal Revenue Code, shall be allocated
13 to this state in the ratio of the original cost
14 of such partnership's tangible property in this
15 state to the original cost of such partnership's
16 tangible property everywhere, as determined at
17 the time of the sale; if more than fifty percent
18 (50%) of the value of the partnership's assets
19 consists of intangible assets, capital or
20 ordinary gains or losses from the sale of an
21 ownership interest in the partnership shall be
22 allocated to this state in accordance with the
23 sales factor of the partnership for its first
24 full tax period immediately preceding its tax

1 period during which the ownership interest in the
2 partnership was sold; the provisions of this
3 division shall only apply if the capital or
4 ordinary gains or losses from the sale of an
5 ownership interest in a partnership do not
6 constitute qualifying gain receiving capital
7 treatment as defined in subparagraph a of
8 paragraph 2 of subsection F of this section,
9 (3) income from such property which is required to be
10 allocated pursuant to the provisions of paragraph
11 5 of this subsection shall be allocated as herein
12 provided;
13 c. Net income or loss from a business activity which is
14 not a part of business carried on within or without
15 the state of a unitary character shall be separately
16 allocated to the state in which such activity is
17 conducted;
18 d. In the case of a manufacturing or processing
19 enterprise the business of which in Oklahoma consists
20 solely of marketing its products by:
21 (1) sales having a situs without this state, shipped
22 directly to a point from without the state to a
23 purchaser within the state, commonly known as
24 interstate sales,

1 (2) sales of the product stored in public warehouses
2 within the state pursuant to "in transit"
3 tariffs, as prescribed and allowed by the
4 Interstate Commerce Commission, to a purchaser
5 within the state,
6 (3) sales of the product stored in public warehouses
7 within the state where the shipment to such
8 warehouses is not covered by "in transit"
9 tariffs, as prescribed and allowed by the
10 Interstate Commerce Commission, to a purchaser
11 within or without the state,
12 the Oklahoma net income shall, at the option of the
13 taxpayer, be that portion of the total net income of
14 the taxpayer for federal income tax purposes derived
15 from the manufacture and/or processing and sales
16 everywhere as determined by the ratio of the sales
17 defined in this section made to the purchaser within
18 the state to the total sales everywhere. The term
19 "public warehouse" as used in this subparagraph means
20 a licensed public warehouse, the principal business of
21 which is warehousing merchandise for the public;
22 e. In the case of insurance companies, Oklahoma taxable
23 income shall be taxable income of the taxpayer for
24 federal tax purposes, as adjusted for the adjustments

1 provided pursuant to the provisions of paragraphs 1
2 and 2 of this subsection, apportioned as follows:
3 (1) except as otherwise provided by division (2) of
4 this subparagraph, taxable income of an insurance
5 company for a taxable year shall be apportioned
6 to this state by multiplying such income by a
7 fraction, the numerator of which is the direct
8 premiums written for insurance on property or
9 risks in this state, and the denominator of which
10 is the direct premiums written for insurance on
11 property or risks everywhere. For purposes of
12 this subsection, the term "direct premiums
13 written" means the total amount of direct
14 premiums written, assessments and annuity
15 considerations as reported for the taxable year
16 on the annual statement filed by the company with
17 the Insurance Commissioner in the form approved
18 by the National Association of Insurance
19 Commissioners, or such other form as may be
20 prescribed in lieu thereof,
21 (2) if the principal source of premiums written by an
22 insurance company consists of premiums for
23 reinsurance accepted by it, the taxable income of
24 such company shall be apportioned to this state

1 by multiplying such income by a fraction, the
2 numerator of which is the sum of (a) direct
3 premiums written for insurance on property or
4 risks in this state, plus (b) premiums written
5 for reinsurance accepted in respect of property
6 or risks in this state, and the denominator of
7 which is the sum of (c) direct premiums written
8 for insurance on property or risks everywhere,
9 plus (d) premiums written for reinsurance
10 accepted in respect of property or risks
11 everywhere. For purposes of this paragraph,
12 premiums written for reinsurance accepted in
13 respect of property or risks in this state,
14 whether or not otherwise determinable, may at the
15 election of the company be determined on the
16 basis of the proportion which premiums written
17 for insurance accepted from companies
18 commercially domiciled in Oklahoma bears to
19 premiums written for reinsurance accepted from
20 all sources, or alternatively in the proportion
21 which the sum of the direct premiums written for
22 insurance on property or risks in this state by
23 each ceding company from which reinsurance is
24 accepted bears to the sum of the total direct

1 premiums written by each such ceding company for
2 the taxable year.
3 5. The net income or loss remaining after the separate
4 allocation in paragraph 4 of this subsection, being that which is
5 derived from a unitary business enterprise, shall be apportioned to
6 this state on the basis of the arithmetical average of three factors
7 consisting of property, payroll and sales or gross revenue
8 enumerated as subparagraphs a, b and c of this paragraph. Net
9 income or loss as used in this paragraph includes that derived from
10 patent or copyright royalties, purchase discounts, and interest on
11 accounts receivable relating to or arising from a business activity,
12 the income from which is apportioned pursuant to this subsection,
13 including the sale or other disposition of such property and any
14 other property used in the unitary enterprise. Deductions used in
15 computing such net income or loss shall not include taxes based on
16 or measured by income. Provided, for corporations whose property
17 for purposes of the tax imposed by Section 2355 of this title has an
18 initial investment cost equaling or exceeding Two Hundred Million
19 Dollars ($200,000,000.00) and such investment is made on or after
20 July 1, 1997, or for corporations which expand their property or
21 facilities in this state and such expansion has an investment cost
22 equaling or exceeding Two Hundred Million Dollars ($200,000,000.00)
23 over a period not to exceed three (3) years, and such expansion is
24 commenced on or after January 1, 2000, the three factors shall be

1 appo rtioned with property and payroll, each comprising twenty-five
2 percent (25%) of the apportionment factor and sales comprising fifty
3 percent (50%) of the apportionment factor. The apportionment
4 factors shall be computed as follows:
5 a. The property factor is a fraction, the numerator of
6 which is the average value of the taxpayer's real and
7 tangible personal property owned or rented and used in
8 this state during the tax period and the denominator
9 of which is the average value of all the taxpayer's
10 real and tangible personal property everywhere owned
11 or rented and used during the tax period.
12 (1) Property, the income from which is separately
13 allocated in paragraph 4 of this subsection,
14 shall not be included in determining this
15 fraction. The numerator of the fraction shall
16 include a portion of the investment in
17 transportation and other equipment having no
18 fixed situs, such as rolling stock, buses, trucks
19 and trailers, including machinery and equipment
20 carried thereon, airplanes, salespersons'
21 automobiles and other similar equipment, in the
22 proportion that miles traveled in Oklahoma by
23 such equipment bears to total miles traveled,
24

1 (2) Property owned by the taxpayer is valued at its
2 original cost. Property rented by the taxpayer
3 is valued at eight times the net annual rental
4 rate. Net annual rental rate is the annual
5 rental rate paid by the taxpayer, less any annual
6 rental rate received by the taxpayer from
7 subrentals,
8 (3) The average value of property shall be determined
9 by averaging the values at the beginning and
10 ending of the tax period but the Oklahoma Tax
11 Commission may require the averaging of monthly
12 values during the tax period if reasonably
13 required to reflect properly the average value of
14 the taxpayer's property;
15 b. The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of
16 which is the total compensation for services rendered
17 in the state during the tax period, and the
18 denominator of which is the total compensation for
19 services rendered everywhere during the tax period.
20 "Compensation", as used in this subsection means those
21 paid-for services to the extent related to the unitary
22 business but does not include officers' salaries,
23 wages and other compensation.
24

1 (1) In the case of a transportation enterprise, the
2 numerator of the fraction shall include a portion
3 of such expenditure in connection with employees
4 operating equipment over a fixed route, such as
5 railroad employees, airline pilots, or bus
6 drivers, in this state only a part of the time,
7 in the proportion that mileage traveled in
8 Oklahoma bears to total mileage traveled by such
9 employees,
10 (2) In any case the numerator of the fraction shall
11 include a portion of such expenditures in
12 connection with itinerant employees, such as
13 traveling salespersons, in this state only a part
14 of the time, in the proportion that time spent in
15 Oklahoma bears to total time spent in furtherance
16 of the enterprise by such employees;
17 c. The sales factor is a fraction, the numerator of which
18 is the total sales or gross revenue of the taxpayer in
19 this state during the tax period, and the denominator
20 of which is the total sales or gross revenue of the
21 taxpayer everywhere during the tax period. "Sales",
22 as used in this subsection does not include sales or
23 gross revenue which are separately allocated in
24 paragraph 4 of this subsection.

1 (1) Sales of tangible personal property have a situs
2 in this state if the property is delivered or
3 shipped to a purchaser other than the United
4 States government, within this state regardless
5 of the FOB point or other conditions of the sale;
6 or the property is shipped from an office, store,
7 warehouse, factory or other place of storage in
8 this state and (a) the purchaser is the United
9 States government or (b) the taxpayer is not
10 doing business in the state of the destination of
11 the shipment.
12 (2) In the case of a railroad or interurban railway
13 enterprise, the numerator of the fraction shall
14 not be less than the allocation of revenues to
15 this state as shown in its annual report to the
16 Corporation Commission.
17 (3) In the case of an airline, truck or bus
18 enterprise or freight car, tank car, refrigerator
19 car or other railroad equipment enterprise, the
20 numerator of the fraction shall include a portion
21 of revenue from interstate transportation in the
22 proportion that interstate mileage traveled in
23 Oklahoma bears to total interstate mileage
24 traveled.

1 (4) In the case of an oil, gasoline or gas pipeline
2 enterprise, the numerator of the fraction shall
3 be either the total of traffic units of the
4 enterprise within Oklahoma or the revenue
5 allocated to Oklahoma based upon miles moved, at
6 the option of the taxpayer, and the denominator
7 of which shall be the total of traffic units of
8 the enterprise or the revenue of the enterprise
9 everywhere as appropriate to the numerator. A
10 "traffic unit" is hereby defined as the
11 transportation for a distance of one (1) mile of
12 one (1) barrel of oil, one (1) gallon of gasoline
13 or one thousand (1,000) cubic feet of natural or
14 casinghead gas, as the case may be.
15 (5) In the case of a telephone or telegraph or other
16 communication enterprise, the numerator of the
17 fraction shall include that portion of the
18 interstate revenue as is allocated pursuant to
19 the accounting procedures prescribed by the
20 Federal Communications Commission; provided that
21 in respect to each corporation or business entity
22 required by the Federal Communications Commission
23 to keep its books and records in accordance with
24 a uniform system of accounts prescribed by such

1 Commission, the intrastate net income shall be
2 determined separately in the manner provided by
3 such uniform system of accounts and only the
4 interstate income shall be subject to allocation
5 pursuant to the provisions of this subsection.
6 Provided further, that the gross revenue factors
7 shall be those as are determined pursuant to the
8 accounting procedures prescribed by the Federal
9 Communications Commission.
10 In any case where the apportionment of the three factors
11 prescribed in this paragraph attributes to Oklahoma a portion of net
12 income of the enterprise out of all appropriate proportion to the
13 property owned and/or business transacted within this state, because
14 of the fact that one or more of the factors so prescribed are not
15 employed to any appreciable extent in furtherance of the enterprise;
16 or because one or more factors not so prescribed are employed to a
17 considerable extent in furtherance of the enterprise; or because of
18 other reasons, the Tax Commission is empowered to permit, after a
19 showing by taxpayer that an excessive portion of net income has been
20 attributed to Oklahoma, or require, when in its judgment an
21 insufficient portion of net income has been attributed to Oklahoma,
22 the elimination, substitution, or use of additional factors, or
23 reduction or increase in the weight of such prescribed factors.
24 Provided, however, that any such variance from such prescribed

1 fact ors which has the effect of increasing the portion of net income
2 attributable to Oklahoma must not be inherently arbitrary, and
3 application of the recomputed final apportionment to the net income
4 of the enterprise must attribute to Oklahoma only a reasonable
5 portion thereof.
6 6. For calendar years 1997 and 1998, the owner of a new or
7 expanded agricultural commodity processing facility in this state
8 may exclude from Oklahoma taxable income, or in the case of an
9 individual, the Oklahoma adjusted gross income, fifteen percent
10 (15%) of the investment by the owner in the new or expanded
11 agricultural commodity processing facility. For calendar year 1999,
12 and all subsequent years, the percentage, not to exceed fifteen
13 percent (15%), available to the owner of a new or expanded
14 agricultural commodity processing facility in this state claiming
15 the exemption shall be adjusted annually so that the total estimated
16 reduction in tax liability does not exceed One Million Dollars
17 ($1,000,000.00) annually. The Tax Commission shall promulgate rules
18 for determining the percentage of the investment which each eligible
19 taxpayer may exclude. The exclusion provided by this paragraph
20 shall be taken in the taxable year when the investment is made. In
21 the event the total reduction in tax liability authorized by this
22 paragraph exceeds One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) in any
23 calendar year, the Tax Commission shall permit any excess over One
24 Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) and shall factor such excess into

1 the percentage for subsequent years. Any amount of the exemption
2 permitted to be excluded pursuant to the provisions of this
3 paragraph but not used in any year may be carried forward as an
4 exemption from income pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph
5 for a period not exceeding six (6) years following the year in which
6 the investment was originally made.
7 For purposes of this paragraph:
8 a. "Agricultural commodity processing facility" means
9 building, structures, fixtures and improvements used
10 or operated primarily for the processing or production
11 of marketable products from agricultural commodities.
12 The term shall also mean a dairy operation that
13 requires a depreciable investment of at least Two
14 Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($250,000.00) and which
15 produces milk from dairy cows. The term does not
16 include a facility that provides only, and nothing
17 more than, storage, cleaning, drying or transportation
18 of agricultural commodities, and
19 b. "Facility" means each part of the facility which is
20 used in a process primarily for:
21 (1) the processing of agricultural commodities,
22 including receiving or storing agricultural
23 commodities, or the production of milk at a dairy
24 operation,

1 (2) transporting the agricultural commodities or
2 product before, during or after the processing,
3 or
4 (3) packaging or otherwise preparing the product for
5 sale or shipment.
6 7. Despite any provision to the contrary in paragraph 3 of this
7 subsection, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1999, in
8 the case of a taxpayer which has a farming loss, such farming loss
9 shall be considered a net operating loss carryback in accordance
10 with and to the extent of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C.,
11 Section 172(b)(G). However, the amount of the net operating loss
12 carryback shall not exceed the lesser of:
13 a. Sixty Thousand Dollars ($60,000.00), or
14 b. the loss properly shown on Schedule F of the Internal
15 Revenue Service Form 1040 reduced by one-half (1/2) of
16 the income from all other sources other than reflected
17 on Schedule F.
18 8. In taxable years beginning after December 31, 1995, all
19 qualified wages equal to the federal income tax credit set forth in
20 26 U.S.C.A., Section 45A, shall be deducted from taxable income.
21 The deduction allowed pursuant to this paragraph shall only be
22 permitted for the tax years in which the federal tax credit pursuant
23 to 26 U.S.C.A., Section 45A, is allowed. For purposes of this
24

1 para graph, "qualified wages" means those wages used to calculate the
2 federal credit pursuant to 26 U.S.C.A., Section 45A.
3 9. In taxable years beginning after December 31, 2005, an
4 employer that is eligible for and utilizes the Safety Pays OSHA
5 Consultation Service provided by the Oklahoma Department of Labor
6 shall receive an exemption from taxable income in the amount of One
7 Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00) for the tax year that the service is
8 utilized.
9 10. For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2010,
10 there shall be added to Oklahoma taxable income an amount equal to
11 the amount of deferred income not included in such taxable income
12 pursuant to Section 108(i)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986
13 as amended by Section 1231 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment
14 Act of 2009 (P.L. No. 111-5). There shall be subtracted from
15 Oklahoma taxable income an amount equal to the amount of deferred
16 income included in such taxable income pursuant to Section 108(i)(1)
17 of the Internal Revenue Code by Section 1231 of the American
18 Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (P.L. No. 111-5).
19 11. For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2019,
20 there shall be subtracted from Oklahoma taxable income or adjusted
21 gross income any item of income or gain, and there shall be added to
22 Oklahoma taxable income or adjusted gross income any item of loss or
23 deduction that in the absence of an election pursuant to the
24 provisions of the Pass-Through Entity Tax Equity Act of 2019 would

1 be a llocated to a member or to an indirect member of an electing
2 pass-through entity pursuant to Section 2351 et seq. of this title,
3 if (i) the electing pass-through entity has accounted for such item
4 in computing its Oklahoma net entity income or loss pursuant to the
5 provisions of the Pass-Through Entity Tax Equity Act of 2019, and
6 (ii) the total amount of tax attributable to any resulting Oklahoma
7 net entity income has been paid. The Oklahoma Tax Commission shall
8 promulgate rules for the reporting of such exclusion to direct and
9 indirect members of the electing pass-through entity. As used in
10 this paragraph, "electing pass-through entity", "indirect member",
11 and "member" shall be defined in the same manner as prescribed by
12 Section 2355.1P-2 of this title. Notwithstanding the application of
13 this paragraph, the adjusted tax basis of any ownership interest in
14 a pass-through entity for purposes of Section 2351 et seq. of this
15 title shall be equal to its adjusted tax basis for federal income
16 tax purposes.
17 B. 1. The taxable income of any corporation shall be further
18 adjusted to arrive at Oklahoma taxable income, except those
19 corporations electing treatment as provided in subchapter S of the
20 Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C., Section 1361 et seq., and Section
21 2365 of this title, deductions pursuant to the provisions of the
22 Accelerated Cost Recovery System as defined and allowed in the
23 Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981, Public Law 97-34, 26 U.S.C.,
24 Section 168, for depreciation of assets placed into service after

1 Dece mber 31, 1981, shall not be allowed in calculating Oklahoma
2 taxable income. Such corporations shall be allowed a deduction for
3 depreciation of assets placed into service after December 31, 1981,
4 in accordance with provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, 26
5 U.S.C., Section 1 et seq., in effect immediately prior to the
6 enactment of the Accelerated Cost Recovery System. The Oklahoma tax
7 basis for all such assets placed into service after December 31,
8 1981, calculated in this section shall be retained and utilized for
9 all Oklahoma income tax purposes through the final disposition of
10 such assets.
11 Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Oklahoma Income Tax
12 Act, Section 2351 et seq. of this title, or of the Internal Revenue
13 Code to the contrary, this subsection shall control calculation of
14 depreciation of assets placed into service after December 31, 1981,
15 and before January 1, 1983.
16 For assets placed in service and held by a corporation in which
17 accelerated cost recovery system was previously disallowed, an
18 adjustment to taxable income is required in the first taxable year
19 beginning after December 31, 1982, to reconcile the basis of such
20 assets to the basis allowed in the Internal Revenue Code. The
21 purpose of this adjustment is to equalize the basis and allowance
22 for depreciation accounts between that reported to the Internal
23 Revenue Service and that reported to Oklahoma.
24

1 2. For tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2009, and
2 ending on or before December 31, 2009, there shall be added to
3 Oklahoma taxable income any amount in excess of One Hundred Seventy-
4 five Thousand Dollars ($175,000.00) which has been deducted as a
5 small business expense under Internal Revenue Code, Section 179 as
