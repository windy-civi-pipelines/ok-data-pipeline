3 Section 21-103. A. Before the governing body of a city or town

5 it must obtain the written consent of the owners of at least a
6 majority of the acres to be annexed to the municipality and provide
7 for notice and a public hearing on the proposed annexation of the
8 territory in the manner provided in subsection B of this section.
9 The annexation of land by a connecting strip serving no municipal
10 purpose other than to establish statutory contiguity or
11 adjacentness, or to capture territory within the area to be annexed,
12 constitutes an impermissible exercise of state-delegated authority
13 by a municipality and shall be prohibited. Municipalities with a
14 population of twelve thousand (12,000) or less may only annex up to
15 eight (8) square miles in one area at any one time provided the
16 municipality obtains the written consent of the owners of at least
17 sixty-five percent (65%) of the acres to be annexed and twenty-five
18 percent (25%) of the population to be annexed.
19 B. The governing body shall provide the notice and public
20 hearing required in subsection A of this section in the following
21 manner:
22 1. The governing body of the municipality shall direct that
23 notice of the proposed annexation of the territory be published in a
24 legally qualified newspaper of general circulation in the territory
Req. No. 13830 Page 2

1 and shall describe the boundaries of the territory proposed to be
2 annexed by reference to a map, geographical locations, legal or
3 physical description or other reasonable designation. The notice
4 shall state the date, time, and place the governing body shall
5 conduct a public hearing on the question of annexing the territory.
6 The notice shall be published in a legal newspaper of general
7 circulation in the territory sought to be annexed within fourteen
8 (14) days following the date the governing body directed the notice
9 to be published;
10 2. A copy of the notice of annexation shall be mailed by first-
11 class mail to all owners of property to be annexed as shown by the
12 current year's ownership rolls in the office of the county treasurer
13 and to all owners of property abutting any public right-of-way that
14 forms the boundary of the territory proposed to be annexed and to
15 the Sales and Use Tax Division of the Oklahoma Tax Commission;
16 provided that the notice of annexation shall be mailed by certified
17 mail to every person who owns a parcel of land of five (5) acres or
18 more used for agricultural purposes; and
19 3. The public hearing of such annexation shall be held no
20 earlier than fourteen (14) days nor more than thirty (30) days
21 following the publication and mailing of the notice.

2 annexed.
3 D. 1. Before any territory is annexed to a municipality,
4 without the written consent of the owners of at least a majority of
5 the acres to be annexed to the municipality in accordance with
6 subsection A of this section, the governing body of the municipality
7 shall direct that notice of the proposed annexation of the territory
8 be published in a legally qualified newspaper of general circulation
9 in the territory and shall hold a public hearing on the proposed
10 annexation. Prior and prior to the publication of notice pursuant
11 to subsection B of this section, the municipality shall prepare a
12 plan to extend municipal services including, but not limited to,
13 water, sewer, fire protection, law enforcement and the cost of such
14 services appropriate to the proposed annexed territory. The plan
15 shall be included in the notices published and mailed pursuant to
16 subsection B of this section. The plan shall provide that the
17 municipality complete the implementation of the plan in accordance
18 with any existing capital improvement plan applicable to the portion
19 of the municipality adjacent to the territory proposed to be
20 annexed. If no such capital improvement plan has been adopted, the
21 municipality shall complete the service plan within one hundred
22 twenty (120) months from the date of annexation unless a different
23 time is determined by consensus between property owners and the
24 municipality at the hearing. The time for completion of the service
Req. No. 13830 Page 4

3 notice of annexation shall be mailed by certified mail to every
4 person who owns parcel of land of five (5) acres or more used for
5 agricultural purposes and to the board of county commissioners of
6 the respective county where the proposed annexation is located. If
7 the territory to be annexed encroaches upon any adjacent county, a
8 copy of the notice of annexation shall be mailed by first-class mail
9 to the board of county commissioners of the adjacent county and of
10 the county where the proposed annexation is located;
11 2. The public hearing of such annexation shall be held no

13 following the publication and mailing of the notice; and
14 3. The proposed service plan shall be available for inspection
15 and be explained to the property owners of the territory to be
16 annexed at the public hearing. The plan may be amended through
17 negotiation at the hearing. The final service plan shall be
18 incorporated into and made part of the ordinance annexing the
19 territory. If the municipality fails to detach pursuant to Section
20 21-110 of this title, then the majority of the annexed territory's
21 registered voters may file a petition with the municipality to
22 detach the territory. The petition shall include a legal
23 description of the area to be detached, contain a plat or similar
24 depiction of the area and detail the reason for detachment. The

2 subdivision of the municipality to which it is seeking to be
3 detached, shall have at least one border not within the municipality
4 limits to which the property is seeking to be detached, and shall
5 plead the allegations of failure of the municipality to
6 substantially complete the services set forth in the annexation.
7 Such petition shall be filed with the municipal clerk. If the
8 municipality fails or refuses to detach the area within ninety (90)
9 days of receipt of the petition, any of the petitioners may bring a
10 cause of action in district court to request detachment. The
11 district court shall enter an order detaching the property if the
12 court finds a valid petition was filed with the municipality and the
13 municipality failed to perform its obligations in accordance with
14 the service plan.
15 E. Subject to the requirements of subsections A and B of this
16 section, if the municipality fails to reach the thresholds of
17 consent of owners, a municipality may annex a territory which is
18 bordered by at least fifty percent (50%) by property within
19 municipal limits without such consent in the limited circumstance
20 where the governing board proves beyond a preponderance of the
21 evidence that the annexation will provide more benefit to all owners
22 than being excluded. Owners can refute more benefit by showing
23 lower current utility rates, trash rates, or sanitation rates than
24 rates offered by the municipality. For emergency services, owners
Req. No. 13830 Page 7

1 can show response time comparisons and costs of service. Any
2 determination of less benefit shall result in a judgment for the
3 owners. The board shall also show that all municipal services
4 offered to all other municipal residents will be provided to the
5 territory within one hundred twenty (120) months from the date of
6 annexation, unless otherwise prohibited by law. To prove such
7 benefit, the municipality shall petition a court of competent
8 jurisdiction and provide service to every person entitled to notice
9 under subsection A of this section. Owners in the territory shall
10 be permitted no less than thirty (30) days from the date of service
11 to present a defense. No municipality may bring a forced annexation
12 under this subsection more often than once per year.
13 F. In any situation where the territory to be annexed by any
14 city or town includes land owned by a state beneficiary public trust
15 or that was previously owned and conveyed by a state beneficiary
16 public trust, annexation shall not be carried out under the
17 provisions of subsection D of this section, but instead shall
18 require the written consent of all of said trust and transferees of
19 said trust.
20 F. G. The prevailing property owner in an annexation dispute
21 shall be entitled to court costs and reasonable attorney fees,
22 including, but not limited to, when a municipality withdraws,
23 revokes or otherwise reverses the ordinance at issue in response to
24 litigation before issuance of a final judgment.
Req. No. 13830 Page 8
