Boles, Kane, George,
Schreiber, and Wilk
A Resolution recognizing March 17, 2025, as Profound
Autism Day at the State Capitol; and expressing the
importance of awareness and support for profound
autism.
WHEREAS, the definition of autism has evolved over the years,
creating an increasingly heterogenous spectrum; and
WHEREAS, while the entire spectrum deserves recognition and
support, profound autism is a term intended to provide clarification
about the autistic people who require 24/7 care from an adult
caregiver throughout his or her life; and
WHEREAS, people with profound autism also can have a severe
intellectual disability or have minimal or no language; and
WHEREAS, individuals with profound autism are frequently
excluded from research and support programs because of his or her
unique needs; and
WHEREAS, the Centers for Disease Control released their first
prevalence study on profound autism in April 2023; and
WHEREAS, the research concluded that the percentage of 8-year-
old children with profound autism among those with autism in the
United States was 26.7%. This means that 1 in 4 children with
autism have profound autism; and
WHEREAS, compared with children with nonâ€“profound autism,
children with profound autism were more likely to be female, from
racial and ethnic minority groups, of low socioeconomic status, born

preterm or with low birth weight, have self-injurious behaviors,
have seizure disorders, and have lower adaptive scores; and
WHEREAS, people with profound autism and those who care for them
live in our midst, frequently in isolation, and need our inclusion
and support. Specific consideration of their unique challenge is
critical.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
OF THE 1ST SESSION OF THE 60TH OKLAHOMA LEGISLATURE:
THAT Monday, March 17th, 2025, is hereby recognized by the
Oklahoma House of Representatives and the State of Oklahoma as
Profound Autism Day, in order to raise public awareness and support
for profound autism within our communities and within our state.
Adopted by the House of Representatives the 13th day of March,
