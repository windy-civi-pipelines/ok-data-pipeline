13 WHEREAS, the definition of autism has evolved over the years,
14 creating an increasingly heterogenous spectrum; and
15 WHEREAS, while the entire spectrum deserves recognition and
16 support, profound autism is a term intended to provide clarification
17 about the autistic people who require 24/7 care from an adult
18 caregiver throughout his or her life; and
19 WHEREAS, people with profound autism also can have a severe
20 intellectual disability or have minimal or no language; and
21 WHEREAS, individuals with profound autism are frequently
22 excluded from research and support programs because of his or her
23 unique needs; and

1 WHEREAS, the Centers for Disease Control released their first
2 prevalence study on profound autism in April 2023; and
3 WHEREAS, the research concluded that the percentage of 8-year-
4 old children with profound autism among those with autism in the
5 United States was 26.7%. This means that 1 in 4 children with
6 autism have profound autism; and
7 WHEREAS, compared with children with nonâ€“profound autism,
8 children with profound autism were more likely to be female, from
9 racial and ethnic minority groups, of low socioeconomic status, born
10 preterm or with low birth weight, have self-injurious behaviors,
11 have seizure disorders, and have lower adaptive scores; and
12 WHEREAS, people with profound autism and those who care for them
13 live in our midst, frequently in isolation, and need our inclusion
14 and support. Specific consideration of their unique challenge is
15 critical.
16 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
17 OF THE 1ST SESSION OF THE 60TH OKLAHOMA LEGISLATURE:
18 THAT Monday, March 17th, 2025 is hereby recognized by the
