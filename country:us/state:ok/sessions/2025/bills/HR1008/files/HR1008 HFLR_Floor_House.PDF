12 WHEREAS, the definition of autism has evolved over the years,
13 creating an increasingly heterogenous spectrum; and
14 WHEREAS, while the entire spectrum deserves recognition and
15 support, profound autism is a term intended to provide clarification
16 about the autistic people who require 24/7 care from an adult
17 caregiver throughout his or her life; and
18 WHEREAS, people with profound autism also can have a severe
19 intellectual disability or have minimal or no language; and
20 WHEREAS, individuals with profound autism are frequently
21 excluded from research and support programs because of his or her
22 unique needs; and
23 WHEREAS, the Centers for Disease Control released their first
24 prevalence study on profound autism in April 2023; and

1 WHEREAS, the research concluded that the percentage of 8-year-
2 old children with profound autism among those with autism in the
3 United States was 26.7%. This means that 1 in 4 children with
4 autism have profound autism; and
5 WHEREAS, compared with children with nonâ€“profound autism,
6 children with profound autism were more likely to be female, from
7 racial and ethnic minority groups, of low socioeconomic status, born
8 preterm or with low birth weight, have self-injurious behaviors,
9 have seizure disorders, and have lower adaptive scores; and
10 WHEREAS, people with profound autism and those who care for them
11 live in our midst, frequently in isolation, and need our inclusion
12 and support. Specific consideration of their unique challenge is
13 critical.
14 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
15 OF THE 1ST SESSION OF THE 60TH OKLAHOMA LEGISLATURE:
