of Section 2355 of this title to the Compressed Natural Gas
13
14

15
16
J. For the tax years 2020 through 2022, the total amount of
16
17
credits authorized by this section used to offset tax shall be
17
18
adjusted annually to limit the annual amount of credits to Twenty
18
19
Million Dollars ($20,000,000.00). The Tax Commission shall annually
19
20
calculate and publish by the first day of the affected taxable year
20
21
a percentage by which the credits authorized by this section shall
21
22
be reduced so the total amount of credits used to offset tax does
22
23
not exceed Twenty Million Dollars ($20,000,000.00) per year. The
23
24
formula to be used for the percentage adjustment shall be Twenty
24
Req. No. 832 Page 21
1
Million Dollars ($20,000,000.00) divided by the credits claimed in
1
2
the second preceding year, with respect to any changes to the future

4
K. Pursuant to subsection J of this section, in the event the

6
7
shall permit any excess over Twenty Million Dollars ($20,000,000.00)
7
8
but shall factor such excess into the percentage adjustment formula
8
9
for subsequent years with respect to any changes to the future of
9
10
the credit.
10
11
L. For the tax years 2023 through 2028, the total amount of
11
12
credits authorized by this section used to offset tax shall be
12
13
adjusted annually to limit the annual amount of credits to:
13
14

Section 62:
1. Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000.00) for qualified clean
14
15
burning fuel property propelled by compressed natural gas, liquefied
15
16
natural gas, or liquefied petroleum gas, property related to the
16
17
delivery of compressed natural gas, liquefied natural gas or

19
20

Section 63:

1
2
metered-for-fee, public access recharging system for motor vehicles
2
3
propelled in whole or in part by electricity.
3
4
The Tax Commission shall annually calculate and publish by the
4
5
first day of the affected taxable year a percentage by which the
5
6
credits authorized by this section shall be reduced so the total
6
7
amount of credits used to offset tax does not exceed each of the
7
8
limits provided in paragraphs 1 through 3 of this subsection. The
8
9
formula to be used for the percentage adjustment shall be Ten
9
10
Million Dollars ($10,000,000.00) divided by the credits claimed in
10
11
the second preceding year, with respect to any changes to the future
11
12
of the credit.
12
13
M. Pursuant to subsection L of this section, in the event the
13
14
tax credits authorized by this section exceed any of the limits
14
15
provided in paragraphs 1 through 3 of subsection L of this section
15
16
in any year, the Tax Commission shall permit any excess over Ten
16
17
Million Dollars ($10,000,000.00) but shall factor such excess into
17
18
the percentage adjustment formula for subsequent years with respect
18
19
to any changes to the future of the credit.
19
20
N. The Tax Commission shall notify the Office of the State
20
21
Secretary of Energy and Environment at any time when the amount of
21
22
claims for credits allowed pursuant to this section reaches eighty
22
23
percent (80%) of the total annual limit provided in subsection J of
23
24
this section. Upon such notification, the Secretary shall provide

12
13
promulgate rules by which the purpose of this section shall be
13
14
administered including the power to establish and enforce penalties
14

17
credit authorized pursuant to subsection A of this section has been
17
18
previously claimed for a vehicle, as identified by its vehicle
18
19

19
20
I. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2352 of this
20
21
title, for the fiscal year beginning on July 1, 2014, through fiscal
21
22
year 2023, the Tax Commission shall calculate an amount that equals
22
23
five percent (5%) of the cost of qualified clean-burning motor
23
24
vehicle fuel property as provided for in paragraph 1 of subsection D
24
Req. No. 832 Page 20

1
of this section for tax year 2012. For each subsequent fiscal year
1
2
thereafter, the Tax Commission shall perform the same computation
2
3
with respect to the second tax year preceding the beginning of each
3
4
subsequent fiscal year. For fiscal year 2024, the Tax Commission
4
5
shall calculate an amount that equals twelve percent (12%) of the
5
6
credit for qualified clean-burning motor vehicle fuel property as
6
7
provided in paragraph 1 of subsection D of this section for tax year
7
8
2021. For each subsequent fiscal year, the Tax Commission shall
8
9
perform the same calculation for credits claimed in the second
9
10
preceding tax year. The Tax Commission shall then transfer an
10
11
amount equal to the amount calculated in this subsection from the
11
12
revenue derived pursuant to the provisions of subsections A, B and E
12
13
of Section 2355 of this title to the Compressed Natural Gas
13
14
Conversion Safety and Regulation Fund created in Section 130.25 of
14
15
Title 74 of the Oklahoma Statutes.
15
16
J. For the tax years 2020 through 2022, the total amount of
16
17
credits authorized by this section used to offset tax shall be
17
18
adjusted annually to limit the annual amount of credits to Twenty
18
19
Million Dollars ($20,000,000.00). The Tax Commission shall annually
19
20
calculate and publish by the first day of the affected taxable year
20
21
a percentage by which the credits authorized by this section shall
21
22
be reduced so the total amount of credits used to offset tax does
22
23
not exceed Twenty Million Dollars ($20,000,000.00) per year. The
23
24
formula to be used for the percentage adjustment shall be Twenty
24
Req. No. 832 Page 21

1
Million Dollars ($20,000,000.00) divided by the credits claimed in
1
2
the second preceding year, with respect to any changes to the future
2
3
of the credit.
3
4
K. Pursuant to subsection J of this section, in the event the
4
5
total tax credits authorized by this section exceed Twenty Million
5
6
Dollars ($20,000,000.00) in any calendar year, the Tax Commission
6
7
shall permit any excess over Twenty Million Dollars ($20,000,000.00)
7
8
but shall factor such excess into the percentage adjustment formula
8
9
for subsequent years with respect to any changes to the future of
9
10
the credit.
10
11
L. For the tax years 2023 through 2028, the total amount of
11
12
credits authorized by this section used to offset tax shall be
12
13
adjusted annually to limit the annual amount of credits to:
13
14
1. Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000.00) for qualified clean
14
15
burning fuel property propelled by compressed natural gas, liquefied
15
16
natural gas, or liquefied petroleum gas, property related to the
16
17
delivery of compressed natural gas, liquefied natural gas or
17
18
liquefied petroleum gas, and property directly related to the
18
19
compression and delivery of natural gas;
19
20
2. Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000.00) for property originally
20
21
equipped so that the vehicle may be propelled by a hydrogen fuel
21
22
cell electric fueling system and property directly related to the
22
23
delivery of hydrogen; and
23
24
24
Req. No. 832 Page 22

3. Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000.00) for property which is a
1
2
metered-for-fee, public access recharging system for motor vehicles
2
3
propelled in whole or in part by electricity.
3
4
The Tax Commission shall annually calculate and publish by the
4
5
first day of the affected taxable year a percentage by which the
5
6
credits authorized by this section shall be reduced so the total
6
7
amount of credits used to offset tax does not exceed each of the
7
8
limits provided in paragraphs 1 through 3 of this subsection. The
8
9
formula to be used for the percentage adjustment shall be Ten
9
10
Million Dollars ($10,000,000.00) divided by the credits claimed in
10
11
the second preceding year, with respect to any changes to the future
11
12
of the credit.
12
13
M. Pursuant to subsection L of this section, in the event the
13
14
tax credits authorized by this section exceed any of the limits
14
15
provided in paragraphs 1 through 3 of subsection L of this section
15
16
in any year, the Tax Commission shall permit any excess over Ten
16
17
Million Dollars ($10,000,000.00) but shall factor such excess into
17
18
the percentage adjustment formula for subsequent years with respect
18
19
to any changes to the future of the credit.
19
20
N. The Tax Commission shall notify the Office of the State
20
21
Secretary of Energy and Environment at any time when the amount of
21
22
claims for credits allowed pursuant to this section reaches eighty
22
23
percent (80%) of the total annual limit provided in subsection J of
23
24
this section. Upon such notification, the Secretary shall provide
24
Req. No. 832 Page 23
