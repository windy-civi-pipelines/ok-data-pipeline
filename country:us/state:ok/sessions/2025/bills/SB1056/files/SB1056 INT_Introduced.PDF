19

19
20
Oklahoma Statutes, employed by the state or any political
20
21
subdivision of this state who, under color of law, subjects or

the injured party for legal or equitable relief or any other
2
3
appropriate relief.
3
4
B. Statutory immunities and statutory limitations on liability,
4
5

5

this section.
9
10
D. In any action brought pursuant to this section, a court
10
11
shall award reasonable attorney fees and costs to a prevailing
11
12
plaintiff. In actions for injunctive relief, a court shall deem a
12
13
plaintiff to have prevailed if the lawsuit of the plaintiff was a

the defendant for defending any claims the court finds frivolous.

officer for any liability incurred by the peace officer and for any

judgment or settlement entered against the peace officer for claims

arising pursuant to this section; provided, however, if the employer
21
22
of the peace officer determines the peace officer did not act in
22
23
good faith and upon a reasonable belief that the action was lawful,
23
24
the peace officer shall be personally liable and shall not be

($25,000.00), whichever is less. Notwithstanding any provision of
3

this section to the contrary, if the peace officerâ€™s portion of the
4
5
judgment is not collectible from the peace officer, the employer of
5

the peace officer or insurance provider shall satisfy the full
6

amount of the judgment or settlement. The peace officer shall not
7
8
be indemnified by the employer for any monetary judgments or legal
8
9
expenses, including attorney fees, if the conduct of the peace
9
10
officer from which the claim arose constituted a criminal offense
10
11
and the peace officer was convicted of such criminal offense.
