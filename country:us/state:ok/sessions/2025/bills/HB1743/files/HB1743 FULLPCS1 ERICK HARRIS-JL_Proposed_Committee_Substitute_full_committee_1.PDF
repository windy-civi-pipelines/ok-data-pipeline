3 B. Notice to creditors and notice of hearing upon the petition
4 for summary administration and the final accounting, determination
5 of heirship, and distribution and discharge shall be combined into
6 one notice, referred to as a "combined notice". Combined notice

2 will determine at the hearing whether the will attached to the
3 petition shall be admitted to probate, whether summary proceedings
4 are appropriate and, if so, whether the estate will be distributed
5 and to whom the estate will be distributed; and
6 10. The claim of any creditor will be barred unless the claim
7 is presented to the personal representative no more than thirty (30)
8 days following the granting of the order admitting the petition and
9 combined notice.
10 C. Within ten (10) days of the granting of the order admitting

15 by law to publish legal notices and that is published in the county
16 where the petition is filed. If no newspaper authorized by law to
17 publish legal notices is published in the county, the notice shall
18 be posted in three public places in the county, one of which shall
19 be the county courthouse. Within ten (10) days of the granting of
20 the order admitting the petition and combined notice, the combined
21 notice shall be mailed to creditors of the decedent as provided in

8 the hearing may be postponed to a date certain.

10 of the public peace, health or safety, an emergency is hereby
11 declared to exist, by reason whereof this act shall take effect and
