3 conveyance, duly verified by oath, setting forth the nature of the
4 fraudulent conveyance. Such notice may be filed of record by the

10 fraudulent conveyance shall contain an accurate and full description
11 of the real property affected by the recorded fraudulent conveyance.

14 property is situated. Except as provided in subsection D of this
15 section, the county clerk shall accept any notice presented that
16 describes real property located in the county and shall enter,
17 record, and index such notice in the same manner that a deed is
18 recorded. A county clerk may charge fees for the recording of the
19 notice in accordance with the county clerk fee schedule set forth in
