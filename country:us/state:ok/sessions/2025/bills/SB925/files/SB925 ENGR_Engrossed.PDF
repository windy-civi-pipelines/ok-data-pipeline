1 frau dulent conveyance. Such notice may be filed of record by the
2 victim or by any other person acting on behalf of the victim who is
3 under a disability or otherwise unable to assert the claim on his or
4 her own behalf. Such notice shall serve as constructive notice that
5 the conveyance is alleged to be fraudulent.
6 B. To be effective and entitled to be recorded, notice of a
7 fraudulent conveyance shall contain an accurate and full description
8 of the real property affected by the recorded fraudulent conveyance.
9 Such notice of fraudulent conveyance shall be filed for record in
10 the county clerk’s office of the county or counties where the real
11 property is situated. Except as provided in subsection D of this
12 section, the county clerk shall accept any notice presented that
13 describes real property located in the county and shall enter,
14 record, and index such notice in the same manner that a deed is
15 recorded. A county clerk may charge fees for the recording of the
16 notice in accordance with the county clerk fee schedule set forth in
17 Section 32 of Title 28 of the Oklahoma Statutes. The name or names
18 of any victim appearing in such notice shall be entered as a grantee
19 or grantees in such indexes.

21 county clerk shall deliver a copy of the notice to the district

2 process as defined in subsection H of Section 1533 of Title 21 of
3 the Oklahoma Statutes, or if the clerk has a reasonable belief that
4 the notice is being presented as a slander of title to the real
5 property. If the county clerk refuses to file a notice of
6 fraudulent conveyance, the aggrieved party may petition the district
7 court for a writ of mandamus to compel the county clerk to record
8 the notice pursuant to the provisions of Section 75 of Title 16 of
9 the Oklahoma Statutes.
