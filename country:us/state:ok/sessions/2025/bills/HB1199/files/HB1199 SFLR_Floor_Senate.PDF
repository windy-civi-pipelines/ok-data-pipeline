7 1. "Legal tender" means a recognized medium of exchange for the
8 payment of debts and taxes; and
9 2. "Specie" means:
10 a. coin having gold or silver content, or
11 b. refined gold or silver bullion that is:
12 (1) coined, stamped, or imprinted with its weight,
13 and
14 (2) valued primarily based on its metal content and
15 not its form.
16 B. Specie or legal tender shall consist of:
17 1. Specie coin issued by the United States government; or
