the holders of such bonds, and/or
(5) After such notice to the district as such resolution

consequence; provided, however, that the holders of
more than a majority in principal amount of the bonds
authorized thereby and at the time outstanding by
instrument or instruments in writing delivered to such
trustee have the right to direct and control any and
all action taken or to be taken by such trustee under
this paragraph. Any such resolution, indenture or
agreement may provide that in any such suit, action or
proceeding, any such trustee, whether or not all of
such bonds shall have been declared due and payable,
and with or without possession of any thereof, shall
be entitled as of right to the appointment of a

any part of the properties of the district and operate
and maintain the same, and fix, collect and receive
rates and charges sufficient to provide revenues
adequate to pay the items set forth in subparagraphs

title and the costs and disbursements of such suit,
action or proceeding, and to apply such revenues in
conformity with the provisions of Section 861 et seq.
of this title and the resolution or resolutions
authorizing such bonds. In any suit, action or
proceeding by any such trustee, the reasonable fees,
counsel fees and expense of such trustee and of the
receiver or receivers, if any, shall constitute
taxable disbursements and all costs and disbursements,
and all costs and disbursements allowed by the court
shall be a first charge upon any revenues pledged to
secure the payment of such bonds. Subject to the
provisions of the Oklahoma Constitution of the State
of Oklahoma, the courts of the County of Craig, or
other county wherein the domicile may be situated,
ENR. H. B. NO. 1422 Page 5

shall have jurisdiction of any such suit, action or
proceeding by any such trustee on behalf of the
bondholders and of all property involved therein. In
addition to the powers hereinabove specifically
provided for, each such trustee shall have and possess
all powers necessary or appropriate for the exercise
of any thereof, or incident to the general
representation of the bondholders in the enforcement
of their right.
Before any bonds shall be sold by the district, a certified copy
of the proceedings for the issuance thereof, including the form of
such bonds, together with any other information which the Attorney
General of the State of Oklahoma this state may require, shall be
submitted to the Attorney General and if he or she shall find that
such bonds have been issued in accordance with law he or she shall
approve such bonds and execute a certificate to that effect which
shall be filed in the Office of the State Auditor and Inspector of
the State of Oklahoma this state and be recorded in a record kept
for that purpose. No bonds shall be issued until the same shall
have been registered by the State Auditor and Inspector, who shall
so register the same if the Attorney General shall have filed with
the State Auditor and Inspector his or her certificate approving the
bonds and the proceedings for the issuance thereof as hereinabove
provided. All bonds approved by the Attorney General as aforesaid,
and registered by the State Auditor and Inspector as aforesaid, and
issued in accordance with the proceedings so approved shall be valid
and binding obligations of the district and shall be incontestable
for any cause from and after the time of such registration.
