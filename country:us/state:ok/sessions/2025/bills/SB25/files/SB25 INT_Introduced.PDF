SECTION 1. AMENDATORY 69 O.S. 2021, Section 1913, as

follows:
19
20
Section 1913. There is hereby established a fund within the
20
21
State Treasury to be known as the “Rural Economic Transportation
21
22
Reliability and Optimization Fund” to be administered by the
22
23
Oklahoma Department of Transportation. The fund shall be a
23
24
continuing fund, not subject to fiscal year limitations, and shall
24
Req. No. 392 Page 1

consist of any general revenues as may be directly appropriated or
1
2
otherwise provided by law.
2
3
Any monies appropriated to the Rural Economic Transportation
3
4
Reliability and Optimization Fund shall not result in a decrease in
4
5
historic and traditional total state transportation funding levels
5
6
or be used to supplant or replace existing state funds used for
6
7
transportation purposes.

8
In order to ensure that the funds from the Rural Economic
8
9
Transportation Reliability and Optimization Fund are used to enhance
9
10
and not supplant state funding for the Department of Transportation,
10
11
the State Board of Equalization shall examine and investigate the
11
12
funding levels as described. At the meeting of the State Board of
12
13
Equalization held within five (5) days after the monthly
13
14
apportionment in February of each year, the State Board of
14
15
Equalization shall issue a finding and report which shall state
15
16
whether expenditures from the Rural Economic Transportation
16
17
Reliability and Optimization Fund were used to enhance or supplant
17
18
state funding for the Department of Transportation. If the State
18
19
Board of Equalization finds that state funding for the Department of
19
20
Transportation was supplanted by funds from the Rural Economic
20
21
Transportation Reliability and Optimization Fund, the Board shall
21
22
specify the amount by which such funding was supplanted. In this
22
23
event, the Legislature shall not make any appropriations for the
23
24
24
Req. No. 392 Page 2

1
ensuing fiscal year until an appropriation in that amount is made to
1
2
replenish state funding for the Department of Transportation.
2
3
All monies accruing to the credit of the Rural Economic
3
4
Transportation Reliability and Optimization Fund are hereby
4
5
appropriated and shall be used to assist the Department in the
5
6
equitable prioritization of construction, repair, and maintenance of
6
7
state highways in rural areas where robust economic development has
7
8
resulted in traffic safety and circulation difficulties attributed
8
9
to significant and unanticipated increases in traffic volumes and as
9
10
fully recorded and documented by the Department. “Robust economic
10
11
development”, as used in this act section, shall mean those
11
12
conditions of the highways of this state in counties with a
12
13
population of less than seventy-five thousand (75,000) fifty
13
14
thousand (50,000) where traffic volumes have increased to become so
14
15
impaired or hazardous as to constitute a threat to the safety of
15
16
persons or property traveling over or upon such highways.
16
17
When such traffic conditions as described may arise in rural
17
18
areas, the Department of Transportation shall engage the Oklahoma
18
19
Department of Commerce, the Oklahoma Tax Commission, or other
19
20
agencies or entities of the state, as necessary, to confirm the
20
21
relationship of traffic conditions to robust economic development.
21
22
Once said such relationship is confirmed and documented, the
22
23
Department of Transportation may utilize any proceeds from the Rural
23
24
Economic Transportation Reliability and Optimization Fund in an
24
Req. No. 392 Page 3

1
amount not to exceed fifty percent (50%) of the total project costs
1
2
to incentivize and leverage the acceleration and prioritization of
2
3
improvement projects existing in or to be incorporated into the
3
4
Department’s Eight-Year Construction Work Plan.
