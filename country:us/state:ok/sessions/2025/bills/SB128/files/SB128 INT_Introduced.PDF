amended to read as follows:
2
3
Section 1148.5A. If, in the exercise of reasonable diligence,
3
4
service cannot be made upon the defendant personally nor upon any
4
5
person residing upon the premises over fifteen (15) years of age,
5
6
then in lieu of service by certified mail, service may be obtained
6
7
for the sole purpose of adjudicating the right to restitution of the
7
8
premises by the sheriff’s posting or by private process service
8
9
posting of said the summons conspicuously on the building on the
9
10
premises, and, if there be is no building on said the premises, then
10
11
by posting the same at some conspicuous place on the premises sought
11
12
to be recovered at least five (5) seven (7) days prior to the date
12
13
of trial, and by the claimant’s mailing a copy of said the summons
13
14
to the last-known address of the defendant by certified mail at
14
15
least five (5) seven (7) days prior to said the date of trial;
15
16
provided, however, such service for an action pursuant to subsection
16
17
C or D of Section 132 of Title 41 of the Oklahoma Statutes shall be
17
18
posted at least five (5) days prior to the date of trial. Such
18
19

premises, the claimant shall not be precluded from pursuing a
24
Req. No. 241 Page 3

subsequent action for the payment of rent. A judgment for forcible
1
2
entry and detainer shall not preclude the property owner from
2
3
pursuing a subsequent action for other monetary relief. Such
3
4
service shall not be rendered ineffectual by the failure of the
4
5
defendant to actually see or receive such posted process nor by the
5
6
failure of the defendant to actually receive or sign a return
6
7
receipt for such mailed process.
