1 SECTION 3. AMENDATORY 12 O.S. 2021, Section 1148.5A, is
2 amended to read as follows:
3 Section 1148.5A. If, in the exercise of reasonable diligence,
4 service cannot be made upon the defendant personally nor upon any
5 person residing upon the premises over fifteen (15) years of age,
6 then in lieu of service by certified mail, service may be obtained
7 for the sole purpose of adjudicating the right to restitution of the
8 premises by the sheriff’s posting or by private process service
9 posting of said the summons conspicuously on the building on the
10 premises, and, if there be is no building on said the premises, then
11 by posting the same at some conspicuous place on the premises sought
12 to be recovered at least five (5) seven (7) days prior to the date
13 of trial, and by the claimant’s mailing a copy of said the summons
14 to the last-known address of the defendant by certified mail at

17 C or D of Section 132 of Title 41 of the Oklahoma Statutes shall be
18 posted at least five (5) days prior to the date of trial. Such
19 service shall confer no jurisdiction upon the court to render any
20 judgment against the defendant for the payment of money nor for any
21 relief other than the restoration of possession of the premises to
22 the claimant, unless the defendant appears at trial. If the court
23 only renders a judgment for restoration of possession of the
24 premises, the claimant shall not be precluded from pursuing a
ENGR. S. B. NO. 128 Page 3

1 subs equent action for the payment of rent. A judgment for forcible
2 entry and detainer shall not preclude the property owner from
3 pursuing a subsequent action for other monetary relief. Such
4 service shall not be rendered ineffectual by the failure of the
5 defendant to actually see or receive such posted process nor by the
6 failure of the defendant to actually receive or sign a return
7 receipt for such mailed process.
