7 there is created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:
8 A. If a petition under this act contains allegations, and the

13 section shall be afforded an opportunity to be heard at the earliest
14 possible time after the ex parte warrant is executed, but not later

6 Information Center system and similar state databases to determine
7 if either the petitioner or respondent has a history of domestic
8 violence, stalking, or child abuse or neglect.
9 E. The petition and warrant shall be served on the respondent
10 when or immediately after the child is taken into physical custody.
11 F. A warrant to take physical custody of a child, issued by
12 this state or another state, is enforceable throughout this state.
13 If the court finds that a less intrusive remedy will not be
14 effective, it may authorize law enforcement officers to enter
15 private property to take physical custody of the child. If required
16 by exigent circumstances, the court may authorize law enforcement
17 officers to make a forcible entry at any hour.
18 G. If the court finds, after a hearing, that a petitioner
19 sought an ex parte warrant under subsection A of this section for
20 the purpose of harassment or in bad faith, the court may award the
21 respondent reasonable attorney fees, costs, and expenses.
22 H. This act does not affect the availability of relief allowed
23 under the laws of this state other than this act.

13 section shall be afforded an opportunity to be heard at the earliest
14 possible time after the ex parte warrant is executed, but not later

17 first judicial day possible.

6 Information Center system and similar state databases to determine
7 if either the petitioner or respondent has a history of domestic
8 violence, stalking, or child abuse or neglect.
9 E. The petition and warrant shall be served on the respondent
10 when or immediately after the child is taken into physical custody.
11 F. A warrant to take physical custody of a child, issued by
12 this state or another state, is enforceable throughout this state.
13 If the court finds that a less intrusive remedy will not be
14 effective, it may authorize law enforcement officers to enter
15 private property to take physical custody of the child. If required
16 by exigent circumstances, the court may authorize law enforcement
17 officers to make a forcible entry at any hour.
18 G. If the court finds, after a hearing, that a petitioner
19 sought an ex parte warrant under subsection A of this section for
20 the purpose of harassment or in bad faith, the court may award the
21 respondent reasonable attorney fees, costs, and expenses.
22 H. This act does not affect the availability of relief allowed
