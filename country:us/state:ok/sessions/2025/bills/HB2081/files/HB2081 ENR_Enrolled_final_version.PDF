there is created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:
A. If a petition under this act contains allegations, and the
court finds that there is a credible risk that the child is
imminently likely to be wrongfully removed, the court may issue an
ex parte warrant to take physical custody of the child.
B. The respondent on a petition under subsection A of this
section shall be afforded an opportunity to be heard at the earliest
possible time after the ex parte warrant is executed, but not later
than the next judicial day unless a hearing on that date is
impossible. In such event, the court shall hold the hearing on the

risk of imminent wrongful removal of the child is based;

4. Provide for the safe interim placement of the child pending
further order of the court.
D. If feasible, before issuing a warrant and before determining
the placement of the child after the warrant is executed, the court
may order a search of the relevant databases of the National Crime
Information Center system and similar state databases to determine
if either the petitioner or respondent has a history of domestic
violence, stalking, or child abuse or neglect.
E. The petition and warrant shall be served on the respondent
when or immediately after the child is taken into physical custody.
F. A warrant to take physical custody of a child, issued by
this state or another state, is enforceable throughout this state.
If the court finds that a less intrusive remedy will not be
effective, it may authorize law enforcement officers to enter
private property to take physical custody of the child. If required
by exigent circumstances, the court may authorize law enforcement
officers to make a forcible entry at any hour.
G. If the court finds, after a hearing, that a petitioner
sought an ex parte warrant under subsection A of this section for
the purpose of harassment or in bad faith, the court may award the
respondent reasonable attorney fees, costs, and expenses.
H. This act does not affect the availability of relief allowed
under the laws of this state other than this act.
