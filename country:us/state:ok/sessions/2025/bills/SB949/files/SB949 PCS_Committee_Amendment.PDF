20 temporary guardian and the court issues an order for
21 the Department to continue as the temporary guardian

16 order directing the sale of the real property of the
17 vulnerable adult.
18 d. The court may issue an order authorizing the
19 Department to sell personal property of a vulnerable

8 Section 5-206 et seq. of this title or made or construed as an
9 alternative to involuntary commitment under Section 5-410 et seq. of

9 the court may authorize:
10 a. forcible entry of the premises of the vulnerable adult
11 to be protected for the purpose of rendering
