administrative appeal findings to the owner or administrator of the
facility to prevent further incidents.
G. The Office of Client Advocacy shall establish a system for
investigating allegations of misconduct by a person responsible for

SECTION 8. AMENDATORY 43A O.S. 2021, Section 10-106, is
amended to read as follows:
Section 10-106. A. If the Department of Human Services
determines, as a result of its investigation or an investigation by
the Office of Client Advocacy within the State Department of Health,
that a vulnerable adult needs protective services, the Department of
Human Services shall immediately provide or arrange for the
provision of available protective services in the least restrictive
manner, provided the person affirmatively consents to receive these
services.
B. 1. When a caretaker of a vulnerable adult who consents to

such services to the person, the Department may petition to the
court for a decree enjoining the caretaker from interfering with the
provision of protective services to the person.
2. The complaint must allege specific facts sufficient to show

D. 1. Payment for the costs of providing protective services
shall be made from either:
a. the assets of the vulnerable adult consenting to the

SECTION 9. AMENDATORY 43A O.S. 2021, Section 10-108, is
amended to read as follows:
Section 10-108. A. 1. If the Department of Human Services
determines, as a result of its investigation or an investigation by
the Office of Client Advocacy within the State Department of Health,
that a vulnerable adult is suffering from abuse, neglect, self-
neglect, or financial neglect or exploitation presenting a
substantial risk of death or immediate and serious physical harm to
the person or financial exploitation of the estate of the person,
and the vulnerable adult lacks mental capacity to consent to receive

Department’s temporary guardianship shall be paid as
provided for in Section 10-107 of this title.
2. Under no circumstances shall the court authorize the
Department, pursuant to this subsection, to consent or deny consent
to a Do-Not-Resuscitate order or the withdrawal of hydration or
nutrition or other life-sustaining treatment although the court
retains jurisdiction to hear such matters under applicable law.
3. The district court which may be petitioned by the Department
for an order pursuant to paragraph 1 of this subsection is:
a. the district court in the county in which the
vulnerable adult resides,
b. the district court in the county in which the
vulnerable adult is receiving inpatient services, or
ENR. S. B. NO. 949 Page 33

c. the district court in the county where the vulnerable
adult is located when any delay caused by taking the
petition to the district court in the county of the
residence of the vulnerable adult would result in
greater substantial risk of death or greater serious
physical harm to the vulnerable adult. The petition
shall include an explanation of why the petition was
filed in the district court in the county specified by
this subparagraph rather than in the district court as
specified in subparagraph a or b of this paragraph.
B. The petition shall be sworn to and include the name, age,
and address of the vulnerable adult who the Department has

eight (48) hours prior to any such hearing if the petition seeks
temporary guardianship of thirty (30) days or more.
2. a. The hearing shall be set by the court on an expedited
basis, but no later than five (5) calendar days, not
including weekends or holidays when the court is
closed, from the date the notice scheduling hearing is
signed by the judge. The vulnerable adult shall have
a right to a closed hearing unless such vulnerable
adult requests otherwise.

ENR. S. B. NO. 949 Page 34

(1) the legal guardian, guardian ad litem and
caretaker of the vulnerable adult,
(2) any person so requested by the vulnerable adult
to be present at the hearing, and
(3) persons required to be notified pursuant to
Section 3-110 of Title 30 of the Oklahoma
Statutes.
D. 1. Upon sworn testimony of a representative of the
Department, or statement of a district attorney representing the
Department, that immediate and reasonably foreseeable death or
serious physical harm to or financial exploitation of the vulnerable
adult will result, the court may waive prior notice and issue a
seventy-two-hour temporary guardianship and provide involuntary
protective services whether or not during regular courthouse
business hours. However, within twenty-four (24) hours of issuance
of the seventy-two-hour order, the vulnerable adult and the attorney
of the vulnerable adult, if known, shall be personally served with
written notice scheduling a hearing within seventy-two (72) hours.
2. If a hearing on the seventy-two-hour order is declined, or
upon conclusion of any such hearing, the court may terminate the
temporary guardianship and involuntary services or enter a temporary
guardianship for up to thirty (30) additional calendar days as
provided for in subsection G of this section.
E. 1. The vulnerable adult has a right to be present and
represented by counsel at any hearing authorized by this section.
If the vulnerable adult is indigent or, in the determination of the
court, lacks capacity to waive the right to counsel, the court shall
immediately appoint counsel who shall personally meet with the
vulnerable adult and attempt to discuss the petition or any pending
motion prior to any hearing.
2. If the vulnerable adult is not in attendance at a scheduled
hearing, the court shall make a special finding as to why the
vulnerable adult is unable to attend, and, upon the request of the
vulnerable adult or the attorney of the vulnerable adult, may
continue the hearing to allow the vulnerable adult to attend.
ENR. S. B. NO. 949 Page 35

3. If the vulnerable adult is indigent, the cost of
representation by counsel shall be borne by court funds.
4. If the vulnerable adult is not indigent, the court may order
costs of representation paid from the estate in the same manner as
currently paid under the Oklahoma Guardianship and Conservatorship
Act.
F. 1. After a hearing on the petition, the court may:
a. appoint a temporary guardian and order involuntary
protective services including, but not limited to,
authorization for medical and/or psychological
treatment and evaluations, and residential placement
subject to the provisions of subsection G of this
section,

adult, establish any new accounts necessary to pay the
daily living expenses of the vulnerable adult, and
order a full accounting and investigation of the
person alleged to be improperly managing the
vulnerable adult’s estate,
c. suspend or revoke powers of attorney or terminate a
guardianship or conservatorship upon a finding that
the attorney-in-fact, guardian or conservator failed
to act appropriately on behalf of the vulnerable
adult, or
d. order any law enforcement agency to transport any
incapacitated person or vulnerable adult as necessary
for appropriate care, treatment and residential
placement. If such transportation is ordered,
reimbursement for expenses incurred from the
transportation of a vulnerable adult under the
Department’s temporary guardianship shall be paid as
provided for in Section 10-107 of this title.
2. a. Except as otherwise provided by subparagraphs b and c
of this paragraph, the court appointing a temporary
guardian and ordering involuntary protective services
ENR. S. B. NO. 949 Page 36

shall not have authority to order the sale of the real
property of the vulnerable adult.
b. If the Department of Human Services has been appointed
temporary guardian and the court issues an order for
the Department to continue as the temporary guardian
of the vulnerable adult beyond the one hundred eighty
(180) calendar days authorized by this section because
there is no one willing and able to act as guardian
for the vulnerable adult, the Department, as temporary
guardian may, after one (1) year from its initial
appointment, sell the real property of a vulnerable
adult pursuant to the provisions of the Oklahoma
Guardianship and Conservatorship Act.
c. The Department, as temporary guardian of a vulnerable
adult, may also sell the real property of the
vulnerable adult pursuant to the provisions of the
Oklahoma Guardianship and Conservatorship Act prior to
the one-year requirement specified in subparagraph b
of this paragraph, if not selling the real property
would jeopardize the vulnerable adult’s eligibility
for Medicaid. The fact that the vulnerable adult
would be in jeopardy for receipt of Medicaid if the
property was not sold shall be stated upon the court
order directing the sale of the real property of the
vulnerable adult.
d. The court may issue an order authorizing the
Department to sell personal property of a vulnerable
adult when additional resources are required to pay
for necessary care for the vulnerable adult pursuant
to state law.
G. Whenever the court issues an order for involuntary
protective services, the court shall adhere to the following
limitations:
1. Only such protective services as are necessary to remove the
conditions creating the emergency shall be ordered, and the court
shall specifically designate the approved services in the order of
the court. When the conditions creating the emergency have been
ENR. S. B. NO. 949 Page 37

removed, the court shall dismiss the temporary guardianship ordered
pursuant to this section;
2. The scope of service provided by the Department shall be
limited to protective services or the establishment of eligibility
for protective services for the person and estate. The Department
shall request dismissal of the temporary guardianship ordered
pursuant to this section when:
a. an appropriate level of care for the vulnerable adult
as determined by the Department has been established,
b. assets have been secured, if applicable, and
c. a representative payee or trustee has been set for
financial management, if applicable;
3. Protective services authorized by an involuntary protective
services order shall not include a change of residence unless the
court specifically finds such action is necessary to remove the
conditions creating the emergency and gives specific approval for
such action in the order of the court. Emergency placement may be
made to such facilities as nursing homes, hospital rehabilitation
centers, assisted living centers, foster care and in-home
placements, or to other appropriate facilities for emergency care or

to be protected for the purpose of rendering
protective services but only after a reasonable
showing to the court that good faith attempts to gain
voluntary access to the premises have failed and

location for the provision of involuntary services,
and
c. the eviction of persons who are in a position to
exploit the vulnerable adult from any property owned,
leased, or rented by the vulnerable adult and

submitted to the court within thirty (30) calendar days thereafter
reflecting the evaluation findings and recommended services.
3. Upon filing such motion, the prior temporary guardianship
shall remain in full force and effect pending a review hearing after
the thirty-day evaluation period. The caretaker, guardian or next-
of-kin of the vulnerable adult may request that the evaluation
period be shortened for good cause.
4. The evaluation shall include at least the following
information:
a. the address of the place where the person is residing
and the person or agency which is providing care,
treatment, or services at present,
b. a summary of the professional treatment and services

vulnerable adult and the public.
During the hearing to consider the motion to continue the
temporary guardianship of the vulnerable adult for up to one hundred
eighty (180) calendar days, the court shall consider the
Department’s findings and proposed plan of care and any other
evidence presented by the caretaker, guardian or other interested
persons. The court shall either terminate the temporary
guardianship and all involuntary services or continue the temporary
guardianship and specify any necessary services to be provided by
the Department for a period not to exceed one hundred eighty (180)
calendar days. Provided, the court may continue the guardianship of
the Department, if there is no one willing and able to act as
guardian for the vulnerable adult.
