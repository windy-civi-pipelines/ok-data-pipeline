SECTION 1. AMENDATORY 70 O.S. 2021, Section 3-104.4, is
amended to read as follows:
Section 3-104.4. A. The State Board of Education shall adopt
standards for the accreditation of the public schools in this state
according to the requirements of Section 3-104.3 et seq. of this
title, to be effective as set forth in Section 3-104.3 et seq. of
this title. The accreditation standards shall incorporate the
curricular standards established pursuant to Section 11-103.6 of
this title. The accreditation standards shall equal or exceed
nationally recognized accreditation standards to the extent that the
standards are consistent with an academic results oriented approach
to accreditation. The accreditation adopted by the State Board
shall encompass accreditation for elementary schools, middle
schools, junior high schools, and high schools. The accreditation
standards shall be made available for public inspection at the
offices of the State Department of Education.

B. Standards for accreditation adopted by the State Board of
Education shall include standards relating to the provision of
school counselors to the public school children of this state. The
State Board of Education shall require each local school district to
provide information regarding the number of counselors serving each
school site, the duties of all such counselors including all
administrative duties, the number of students served by each
counselor, and information regarding the number of counselors
employed per elementary school, middle school, junior high school
and high school.
C. 1. Except as otherwise provided, schools shall meet the
accreditation standards as a condition of continued accreditation.
Nothing herein shall be construed as preventing changes to the
adopted standards by the State Board of Education pursuant to the
Administrative Procedures Act.
2. The accreditation standards shall provide for deficiencies,
warnings, probation or nonaccredited status for schools that fail to
meet one or more of the standards.
3. The Department State Department of Education shall
investigate a complaint of failure to provide educational services
or failure to comply with accreditation standards within thirty (30)
days of receiving the complaint. If the Department State Department
of Education determines that a school has failed to comply with the
accreditation standards, the Department shall report the recommended
deficiency, warning, probation or nonaccredited accreditation status
to the State Board of Education within ninety (90) days. Before the
State Board of Education may change a school district's
accreditation status from a warning to probation, or from probation
to non-accredited based on a recommendation by the State Department
of Education as described in this paragraph, the school district
shall be given an opportunity to request a hearing before the State
Board of Education pursuant to the due process procedures adopted by
the Board as provided for in this subsection. The State Board of
Education shall send the applicable school district notice of a
right to a hearing within ten (10) working days of receiving the
recommendations. The hearing shall be conducted by the State Board
of Education. All notices shall be sent by certified mail, with the
postmark used to determine the timeliness of the notice. If the
school district fails to request a hearing within ten (10) working
days of receipt of such notice, the district's right to a hearing
shall be waived.

provided by public school districts or state-accredited private
schools. Each school which is providing or is required to provide

in this subsection shall be actively monitored by the State
Department of Education. The Department shall determine on an
ongoing basis if the educational program and services are in
compliance with the accreditation standards.

considering the possibility of meeting accreditation requirements
through the use of nontraditional means of instruction. The State
