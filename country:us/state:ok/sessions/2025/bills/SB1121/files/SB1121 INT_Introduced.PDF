5
6
C. The committee shall conduct a comprehensive study of
6
7
alternative methods of taxation to replace local tax revenue from

the elimination of ad valorem tax pursuant to the passage of the
8

10
11
D. For each alternative method of taxation considered, the
11
12
committee shall:
12
13
1. Consider whether political subdivisions that currently
13
14
impose ad valorem taxes would have the authority to impose the
14
15
proposed alternative tax;
15
16
2. Determine the average tax rate for the proposed alternative
16
17
tax imposed by each type of political subdivision that would be
17
18
necessary to generate the same amount of tax revenue as the amount
18
19
of tax revenue lost as a result of the elimination of ad valorem
19
20
taxes;
20
21
3. Determine, if appropriate, the effect that broadening the
21
22
application of the proposed alternative tax at the local level would
22
23
have on the tax rates identified pursuant to paragraph 2 of this
23
24
subsection;
24
Req. No. 1430 Page 2

method of taxation would require redistribution to offset

disparities in available local tax revenue as a result of the
3
4
elimination of ad valorem taxes and, if so, evaluate the different
4
5
mechanisms of redistribution available; and
5

addressed to implement the elimination of ad valorem taxes.

assistance in conducting the study under this section.

other action.
