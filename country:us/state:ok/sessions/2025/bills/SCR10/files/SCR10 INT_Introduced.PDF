WHEREAS, the restoration of passenger service, known as the
15
16
Heartland Flyer, in 1999 between Fort Worth, Texas, and Oklahoma

21
expanded with further links terminating in Chicago, Illinois. Many
21

departments of transportation; and

10
11
elected counterparts in Texas to continue this over 25-year
11
12
partnership with the State of Oklahoma by taking action within the
12
13
Texas budget process timeline to provide their essential portion of
13
14
resources to allow rail service to remain operational.
