Section 1:
Resolution
ENROLLED SENATE
CONCURRENT
RESOLUTION NO. 10 By: Mann, Coleman, and Boren of
the Senate
and
Bennett, Luttrell, and
McCane of the House
A Concurrent Resolution recognizing the important
rail service; recognizing the critical need for
ongoing financial partnership with the State of
Texas; and urging the Texas Legislature to take
budget action to allow rail service to continue.
WHEREAS, the restoration of passenger service, known as the
Heartland Flyer, in 1999 between Fort Worth, Texas, and Oklahoma
City, Oklahoma, was a successful outcome of partnership between the
State of Oklahoma, the State of Texas, the Oklahoma Congressional
delegation, and the Texas Congressional delegation; and
WHEREAS, this important transportation link is poised to be
expanded with further links terminating in Chicago, Illinois. Many
of Oklahoma’s state and local leaders, stretching from Ardmore to
Ponca City, have worked tirelessly and made strategic investments to
position Oklahoma to compete and receive benefit from these
opportunities; and
WHEREAS, we acknowledge the financial responsibility for this
service is state-based and, therefore, jointly carried by the State
of Oklahoma and the State of Texas and operated by their respective
departments of transportation; and
WHEREAS, the Oklahoma State Legislature acknowledges the Texas
State Legislature is currently deliberating whether to continue
funding its portion of passenger rail operations; and
WHEREAS, the Oklahoma State Legislature respectfully urges its
elected counterparts in Texas to continue this over 25-year
partnership with the State of Oklahoma by taking action within the
Texas budget process timeline to provide their essential portion of
resources to allow rail service to remain operational.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE OF THE 1ST SESSION
OF THE 60TH OKLAHOMA LEGISLATURE, THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
CONCURRING THEREIN:
THAT the Oklahoma State Legislature believes it is important for
Oklahomans to benefit from a range of transportation options,
including passenger rail.
THAT the Oklahoma State Legislature believes protecting the
anchor rail service is essential to maintain current service, to
continue to work to expand ridership, and to seize opportunities to
expand rail service north along the booming Interstate 35
megalopolis.
THAT the Oklahoma State Legislature acknowledges the importance
of the continued existence of passenger rail in Oklahoma, and
understands that once removed, it would be extraordinarily
challenging to restore this service and continue to provide an
additional transportation option for Oklahomans.
THAT the Oklahoma State Legislature urges the Texas State
Legislature to ensure the continuation of the Heartland Flyer by
supporting funding for the passenger rail service in its budget
process.
