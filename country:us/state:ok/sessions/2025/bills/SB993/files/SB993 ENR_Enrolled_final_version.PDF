administrative organization to contest reimbursement amounts within
fourteen (14) calendar days of the final adjusted payment date. The

pharmacy service administrative organization from filing
reimbursement appeals in an electronic batch format. The pharmacy
benefits manager must respond to a provider, a provider’s
representative and a pharmacy service administrative organization
who have contested a reimbursement amount through this procedure

not require a pharmacy or pharmacy services administrative
organization to log into a system to upload individual claim appeals

warranted, the pharmacy benefits manager shall make the change in
the reimbursement amount, permit the dispensing pharmacy to reverse
and rebill the claim in question, and make the reimbursement amount
change retroactive and effective for all contracted providers; and
5. If a below-cost reimbursement appeal is denied, the PBM
shall provide the reason for the denial, including the National Drug
Code (NDC) number from, and the name of, the specific national or
regional wholesalers doing business in this state where the drug is

pharmacy at a price below the PBM’s reimbursement price. The PBM

shall include documented proof from the specific national or
regional wholesalers doing business in this state showing that the
drug is currently in stock and available for purchase by the
dispensing pharmacy at a price below the PBM’s reimbursement price.
If the NDC number provided by the pharmacy benefits manager is not
available below the acquisition cost obtained from the
pharmaceutical wholesaler from whom the dispensing pharmacy
purchases the majority of the prescription drugs that are dispensed,
the pharmacy benefits manager shall immediately adjust the
reimbursement amount, permit the dispensing pharmacy to reverse and
rebill the claim in question, and make the reimbursement amount
adjustment retroactive and effective for all contracted providers;
6. Any appeal that results in an increase in the reimbursement
from the PBM that continues to be below the pharmacy’s acquisition
cost shall be considered a denial under this section. Any denial of
an appeal shall follow the requirements of paragraph 5 of this
subsection; and
7. The PBM shall not require a pharmacy to collect additional
monies following a successful below-cost reimbursement appeal from
any person or entity other than the PBM who adjudicated the drug
claim, including the patient or plan sponsor.
B. The reimbursement appeal requirements in this section shall
apply to all drugs, medical products, or devices reimbursed
according to any payment methodology, including, but not limited to:

Drug Acquisition Cost;

8. Any other term that a pharmacy benefits manager or an
insurer of a health benefit plan may use to establish reimbursement
rates to a pharmacist or pharmacy for pharmacist services.
C. The pharmacy benefits manager shall not place a drug on a
MAC list, unless there are at least two therapeutically equivalent,
multiple-source drugs, generally available for purchase by
dispensing retail pharmacies from national or regional wholesalers.

Database, pharmacy benefits managers shall reimburse claims to
pharmacies at no less than the wholesale acquisition cost for the
specific NDC number being dispensed.

accreditation or licensing of providers, or any entity licensed or
regulated by the State Board of Pharmacy, other than by the State
Board of Pharmacy or federal government entity as a condition for
participation as a network provider.
F. A pharmacy or pharmacist may decline to provide the
pharmacist clinical or dispensing services to a patient or pharmacy
benefits manager if the pharmacy or pharmacist is to be paid less
than the pharmacy’s cost for providing the pharmacist clinical or
dispensing services.
G. The pharmacy benefits manager shall provide a dedicated
telephone number, email address and names of the personnel with
decision-making authority regarding MAC appeals and pricing.
SECTION 9. NEW LAW A new section of law to be codified
in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 360.1 of Title 59, unless there
is created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:
