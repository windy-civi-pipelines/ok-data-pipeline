SECTION 9. NEW LAW A new section of law to be codified
5
6
in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 561-9 of Title 43, unless there
6
7
is created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:
7
8
A. If a petition under this act contains allegations, and the
8
9
court finds that there is a credible risk that the child is
9
10
imminently likely to be wrongfully removed, the court may issue an
10
11
ex parte warrant to take physical custody of the child.
11
12
B. The respondent on a petition under subsection A of this
12
13
section shall be afforded an opportunity to be heard at the earliest
13
14
possible time after the ex parte warrant is executed, but not later
14
15
than the next judicial day unless a hearing on that date is
15
16
impossible. In such event, the court shall hold the hearing on the
16
17
first judicial day possible.
17
18
C. An ex parte warrant under subsection A of this section to
18
19
take physical custody of a child shall:
19
20
1. Recite the facts upon which a determination of a credible
20
21
risk of imminent wrongful removal of the child is based;
21
22
2. Direct law enforcement officers to take physical custody of
22
23
the child immediately;
23
24
3. State the date and time for the hearing on the petition; and

4. Provide for the safe interim placement of the child pending
1
2
further order of the court.
2
3
D. If feasible, before issuing a warrant and before determining
3
4
the placement of the child after the warrant is executed, the court
4
5
may order a search of the relevant databases of the National Crime
5
6
Information Center system and similar state databases to determine
6
7
if either the petitioner or respondent has a history of domestic
7
8
violence, stalking, or child abuse or neglect.
8
9
E. The petition and warrant shall be served on the respondent
9
10
when or immediately after the child is taken into physical custody.
10
11
F. A warrant to take physical custody of a child, issued by
11
12
this state or another state, is enforceable throughout this state.
12
13
If the court finds that a less intrusive remedy will not be
13
14
effective, it may authorize law enforcement officers to enter
14
15
private property to take physical custody of the child. If required
15
16
by exigent circumstances, the court may authorize law enforcement
16
17
officers to make a forcible entry at any hour.
17
18
G. If the court finds, after a hearing, that a petitioner
18
19
sought an ex parte warrant under subsection A of this section for
19
20
the purpose of harassment or in bad faith, the court may award the
20
21
respondent reasonable attorney fees, costs, and expenses.
21
22
H. This act does not affect the availability of relief allowed
22
23
under the laws of this state other than this act.
