inquire of the accused as to the whereabouts of his or her parents,

by certified mail to the person’s last-known address, requesting a
1
2
return receipt from the addressee only. If delivery is refused,
2
3
notice may be given by mailing a copy of the accused’s warrant
3
4
information by regular first-class mail to the address where the
4
5
person to be notified refused delivery of the notice sent by
5
6
certified mail. Where the address of a custodial parent, guardian
6
7
or next friend is not known, or if the mailed copy of the accused’s
7
8
warrant and information is returned for any reason other than
8
9
refusal of the addressee to accept delivery, after a thorough search
9
10
of all reasonably available sources to ascertain the whereabouts of
10
11
a custodial parent, guardian, or next friend has been conducted, the
11
12
court may order that notice of the hearing be given by publication
12
13
one time in a newspaper of general circulation in the county. The
13
14
court may also order other means of service of notice that the court
14
15
deems advisable or in the interests of justice.
15
16
4. Before service by publication is ordered, the court shall
16
17
conduct an inquiry to determine whether a thorough search has been
17
18
made of all reasonably available sources to ascertain the
18
19
whereabouts of any person for whom notice by publication is sought.
19
20
5. The person is presumed to be a youthful offender, and the
20
21
proceedings shall continue under such presumption unless the court
21
22
grants the person’s motion for certification as a juvenile pursuant
22
23
to Section 6 2-5-206A of this act title or grants the district
23

24
Req. No. 333 Page 6

1
attorney’s motion for imposition of an adult sentence pursuant to
1
2
Section 7 2-5-207A of this act title.
2
3
H. The court shall commence the preliminary hearing within
3
4
ninety (90) days of the filing of the information, pursuant to
4
5
Section 258 of Title 22 of the Oklahoma Statutes, to determine
5
6
whether a crime was committed and if there is probable cause to
6
7
believe the accused committed the crime. The requirement for the
7
8
preliminary hearing to be held within ninety (90) days may be waived
8
9
by the accused.
9
10
1. For a person charged under subsection A or B of Section 2-5-
10
11
205 of this title, if the preliminary hearing is not commenced
11
12
within ninety (90) days of the filing date of the information, the
12
13
district court shall hold a hearing to determine the reasons for
13
14
delay utilizing the procedure set out in Section 812.2 of Title 22
14
15
of the Oklahoma Statutes, to ensure the preliminary hearing is
15
16
expedited, unless the ninety-day requirement has been waived by the
16
17
accused.
17
18
2. For a person charged under subsection C, D, or E of Section
18
19
2-5-205 of this title, if the preliminary hearing is not commenced
19
20
within ninety (90) days of the filing of the information, the
20
21
district attorney shall be prohibited from seeking an adult sentence
21
22
unless the ninety-day requirement has been waived by the accused.
22
23
3. For an accused person charged under subsection A, B, C, D,
23
24
or E of Section 2-5-205 of this title, if the whereabouts of the
24
Req. No. 333 Page 7

1
accused are unknown at the time of the filing of the information or
1
2
if the accused is a fugitive, the State of Oklahoma shall make
2
3
reasonable efforts to locate the accused in order to commence the
3
4
proceedings. An accused who flees the jurisdiction of the court or
4
5
purposely avoids apprehension for the charges, waives the right to
5
6
have the preliminary hearing commenced within ninety (90) days of
6
7
the filing of the information. If the preliminary hearing does not
7
8
commence within ninety (90) days from the filing of the information
8
9
due to the absence or inability to locate the accused, the
9
10
preliminary hearing shall commence within ninety (90) days after the
10
11
state has actual notice of the in-state location of the accused. If
11
12
the accused is found out of state, the court shall set the hearing
12
13
within ninety (90) days after the accused has been returned to the
13
14
State of Oklahoma. An accused who fails to cooperate with providing
14
15
information in locating his or her parent, guardian, or next friend
15
16
for purposes of notice waives the right to have the preliminary
16
17
hearing commence within ninety (90) days of the filing of the
17
18
information.
18
19
I. At the conclusion of the state’s case at the preliminary
19
20
hearing, if the accused has filed a motion for certification as a
20
21
juvenile pursuant to subsection A of this section, or if the
21
22
district attorney has filed a motion for the imposition of an adult
22
23
sentence pursuant to Section 7 2-5-207A of this act title, both the
23
24
24
Req. No. 333 Page 8

1
accused and the district attorney may offer evidence in support or
1
2
in opposition of the pending motion or motions.
2
3
J. The court shall rule on any properly filed motion for
3
4
certification as a juvenile or motion for the imposition of an adult
4
5
sentence before ruling on whether to bind the accused over for
5
6
trial.
6
7
SECTION 2. This act shall become effective November 1, 2025.
