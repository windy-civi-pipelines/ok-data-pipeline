10 The statement must contain:
11 (1) the 1. The name of the partnership;
12 (2) the 2. The street address of the partnership's chief
13 executive office and, if different, the street address of an office
14 of the partnership in this state, if any;

16 state, the name and street address of the partnership's agent for
17 service of process;

17 partnership and the liability of its partners is not affected by
18 errors or later changes in the information required to be contained
19 in the statement of qualification under subsection (c) C of this
20 section.
