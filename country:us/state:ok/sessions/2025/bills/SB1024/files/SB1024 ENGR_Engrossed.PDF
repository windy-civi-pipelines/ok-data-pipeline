24 interpret or describe the requirements, such as federally mandated
ENGR. S. B. NO. 1024 Page 11

5 completed. The determination to waive the rule impact statement

9 inaccurate.
10 E. J. Upon completing the requirements of this section, an
11 agency may adopt a proposed rule. No rule is valid unless adopted
12 in substantial compliance with the provisions of this section.
13 SECTION 2. This act shall become effective July 1, 2025.

24 interpret or describe the requirements, such as federally mandated
ENGR. S. B. NO. 1024 Page 11

12 in substantial compliance with the provisions of this section.
