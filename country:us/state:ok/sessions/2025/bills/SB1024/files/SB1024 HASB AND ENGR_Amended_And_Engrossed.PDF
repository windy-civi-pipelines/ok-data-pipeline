8 Oklahoma Register” at least thirty (30) days prior to such hearing.
9 D. I. 1. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, an
10 agency shall issue a rule impact statement of a proposed rule prior

9 any other agency of the implementation and enforcement

11 for implementation and enforcement of the proposed
12 rule, and any anticipated effect on state revenues,
13 including a projected net loss or gain in such

15 f. a determination of whether implementation of the
16 proposed rule will have an economic impact on any
17 political subdivisions or require their cooperation in
18 implementing or enforcing the rule,
19 g. a determination of whether implementation of the
20 proposed rule may have an adverse economic effect on
21 small business as provided by the Oklahoma Small
22 Business Regulatory Flexibility Act,
23 h. an explanation of the measures the agency has taken to
24 minimize compliance costs and a determination of
ENGR. S. B. NO. 1024 Page 10

3 the proposed rule,
4 i. a determination of the effect of the proposed rule on
5 the public health, safety, and environment and, if the

15 3. To the extent an agency for good cause finds the preparation
16 of a rule impact statement or the specified contents thereof are
17 unnecessary or contrary to the public interest in the process of
18 adopting a particular rule, the agency may request the Governor to
19 waive such requirement. Such request shall be in writing and shall
20 state the agency’s findings and the justification for such findings.
21 Upon request by an agency, the Governor may also waive the rule
22 impact statement requirements if the agency is required to implement
23 a statute or federal requirement that does not require an agency to
24 interpret or describe the requirements, such as federally mandated
ENGR. S. B. NO. 1024 Page 11

1 prov isions which afford the agency no discretion to consider less
2 restrictive alternatives. If the Governor fails to waive such
3 requirement, in writing, prior to publication of the notice of the
4 intended rulemaking action, the rule impact statement shall be
5 completed. The determination to waive the rule impact statement
6 shall not be subject to judicial review.
7 4. The rule shall not be invalidated on the ground grounds that
8 the contents of the rule impact statement are insufficient or
9 inaccurate.
10 E. J. Upon completing the requirements of this section, an
11 agency may adopt a proposed rule. No rule is valid unless adopted
12 in substantial compliance with the provisions of this section.
13 SECTION 5. This act shall become effective July 1, 2025.
14 SECTION 6. It being immediately necessary for the preservation
15 of the public peace, health or safety, an emergency is hereby
16 declared to exist, by reason whereof this act shall take effect and
17 be in full force from and after its passage and approval.
