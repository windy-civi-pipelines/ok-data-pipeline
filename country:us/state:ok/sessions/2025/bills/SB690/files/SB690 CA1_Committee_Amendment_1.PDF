(Date)
I move to amend Senate Bill No. 690 on Page 16, Lines 14-19, by deleting all new language and
inserting the following and by amending the title to conform:
“Achievement earned credits for a high school diploma or high school equivalency diploma may be
attained by an inmate who completes such a program during continuous custody in a county jail
while awaiting trial, sentencing, or transfer to the custody of the Department of Corrections. To
qualify, an inmate must have been detained in connection with the case that resulted in his or her
prison sentence and there must have been continuous custody in a county jail for program
completion and transfer to the Department. Upon sentencing and transfer to the Department, the
inmate shall receive achievement earned credits in the amount specified in this subsection, provided
the county jail documents completion of the program, including the date of certification earned, on
the official jail sentence form. The official jail sentence form shall accompany the inmate upon
transfer to the Department.”
