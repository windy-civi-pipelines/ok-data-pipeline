discharge a consumer or permit the consumer to leave the facility as
provided in this section.
B. The person in charge shall discharge a consumer:

provided by Section 1-103 of this title;

Section 53:
2. Who is capable of surviving safely in freedom alone or with

requiring any state agency or private entity to provide services

C. The person in charge may grant a convalescent leave or

by the Commissioner of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services.
The facility granting a convalescent leave or visiting status to a
consumer has no responsibility in returning the consumer to the
facility should such become necessary. A convalescent leave or
visiting status may be granted rather than a discharge when the
complete recovery of the consumer can be determined only by
permitting the consumer to leave the facility. The person in charge
shall discharge a consumer who has not returned to the facility
within twelve (12) months from the time a convalescent leave or
visiting status was granted. Any return from convalescent leave or
visiting status must be on a voluntary basis.
D. In accordance with policies prescribed by the Commissioner, a
person in charge may transfer a consumer to an outpatient or other
nonhospital status when, in the opinion of the person in charge, such
transfer will not be detrimental to the public welfare or injurious
to the consumer and the necessary treatment may be continued on that
basis; provided, however, that before transferring the consumer, the
person in charge shall ensure that appropriate financial resources
and appropriate services are available to receive and care for such
consumer after such transfer.
E. The person in charge of the facility shall notify the court
that committed the consumer that the consumer has been discharged.
Such notification shall be within forty-eight (48) hours after the
actual discharge.
F. If the consumer was committed after the dismissal of criminal
charges pursuant to the provisions of Section 1175.6a of Title 22 of
the Oklahoma Statutes:

Section 55:
1. The Department shall continue all appropriate efforts to
restore the consumer to competency as defined by Section 1175.1 of
Title 22 of the Oklahoma Statutes during the consumer’s commitment;
ENR. S. B. NO. 1089 Page 16

Section 56:
2. The Department shall evaluate the consumer for competency and
issue a written report detailing the consumer’s progress in regaining
competency to the attorney of the consumer, the district court that
dismissed the criminal action, and the district attorney or other
prosecuting agency that prosecuted the dismissed criminal action at
least once every year;

Section 57:
3. The Department shall notify the consumer, the attorney of the
consumer, the prosecuting agency that prosecuted the dismissed
criminal action, and the district court that committed the consumer
no less than sixty (60) days prior to any discharge, leave, granting
of visiting status, or transfer of the consumer. Contemporaneously
with the notice, the Department shall provide a written report
evaluating the consumer’s risk to self and others if released, the
consumer’s status and progress in regaining competency, the
consumer’s current and historical compliance with medication and
treatment, and any discharge plan developed for the consumer;

Section 58:
4. The prosecuting agency that prosecuted the dismissed criminal
action may file with the district court that committed the consumer
an objection to the consumer’s discharge, leave, granting of visiting
status, or transfer within thirty (30) days of receipt of notice
pursuant to paragraph 3 of this subsection. The prosecuting agency
shall, regardless of whether an objection is filed, make reasonable
efforts to notify all alleged victims in the dismissed criminal
action, or if an alleged victim is deceased, his or her family, of
the Department’s planned discharge, leave, granting of visiting
status, or transfer of the consumer;

Section 59:
5. The court shall hold a hearing within thirty (30) days of the
filing of an objection by the prosecuting agency to determine whether
the consumer’s planned discharge, leave, granting of visiting status,
or transfer should occur. The consumer shall be entitled to counsel
at the hearing and in preparation for the hearing. If the consumer
does not have counsel, the court shall appoint an attorney to
represent the person at no cost if the person is indigent and cannot
afford an attorney. The hearing may be continued either by agreement
of the parties or upon good cause shown. The prosecuting agency
objecting to the consumer’s discharge, leave, granting of visiting
status, or transfer shall bear the burden of proof, by clear and
convincing evidence, that the planned discharge, leave, granting of
ENR. S. B. NO. 1089 Page 17
visiting status, or transfer should not be granted. In the event of
a planned discharge pursuant to subsection B of this section, the
court shall determine whether the criteria contained within
subsection B of this section has been met. In the event of a
convalescent leave, granting of visiting status, or transfer pursuant
to subsection C or D of this section, the court shall determine

to be returned to the facility, the judge shall cause the consumer to
be brought before the court by issuance of a citation directed to the
consumer to appear and show cause why the consumer should not be
returned to the facility. The judge shall, if clear and convincing
evidence is presented by testimony under oath that the consumer
should be returned to the facility, enter an order returning the
consumer. If there is a lack of clear and convincing evidence
showing the necessity of such return, the consumer shall immediately
be released. Law enforcement officers are authorized to take into
custody, detain and transport a consumer pursuant to a citation or an
order of the judge of the district court.
H. I. An attending physician of any consumer admitted to a

the Oklahoma Statutes:
1. The Department shall continue all appropriate efforts to
restore the consumer to competency as defined by Section 1175.1 of
Title 22 of the Oklahoma Statutes during the consumer’s commitment;
ENR. S. B. NO. 1089 Page 16

2. The Department shall evaluate the consumer for competency and
issue a written report detailing the consumer’s progress in regaining
competency to the attorney of the consumer, the district court that
dismissed the criminal action, and the district attorney or other
prosecuting agency that prosecuted the dismissed criminal action at
least once every year;
3. The Department shall notify the consumer, the attorney of the
consumer, the prosecuting agency that prosecuted the dismissed
criminal action, and the district court that committed the consumer
no less than sixty (60) days prior to any discharge, leave, granting
of visiting status, or transfer of the consumer. Contemporaneously
with the notice, the Department shall provide a written report
evaluating the consumer’s risk to self and others if released, the
consumer’s status and progress in regaining competency, the
consumer’s current and historical compliance with medication and
treatment, and any discharge plan developed for the consumer;
4. The prosecuting agency that prosecuted the dismissed criminal
action may file with the district court that committed the consumer
an objection to the consumer’s discharge, leave, granting of visiting
status, or transfer within thirty (30) days of receipt of notice
pursuant to paragraph 3 of this subsection. The prosecuting agency
shall, regardless of whether an objection is filed, make reasonable
efforts to notify all alleged victims in the dismissed criminal
action, or if an alleged victim is deceased, his or her family, of
the Department’s planned discharge, leave, granting of visiting
status, or transfer of the consumer;
5. The court shall hold a hearing within thirty (30) days of the
filing of an objection by the prosecuting agency to determine whether
the consumer’s planned discharge, leave, granting of visiting status,
or transfer should occur. The consumer shall be entitled to counsel
at the hearing and in preparation for the hearing. If the consumer
does not have counsel, the court shall appoint an attorney to
represent the person at no cost if the person is indigent and cannot
afford an attorney. The hearing may be continued either by agreement
of the parties or upon good cause shown. The prosecuting agency
objecting to the consumer’s discharge, leave, granting of visiting
status, or transfer shall bear the burden of proof, by clear and
convincing evidence, that the planned discharge, leave, granting of
ENR. S. B. NO. 1089 Page 17

visiting status, or transfer should not be granted. In the event of
a planned discharge pursuant to subsection B of this section, the
court shall determine whether the criteria contained within
subsection B of this section has been met. In the event of a
convalescent leave, granting of visiting status, or transfer pursuant
to subsection C or D of this section, the court shall determine
whether the applicable criteria have been met and whether the leave,
granting of visiting status, or transfer is in the best interest of
the consumer and in the best interest of public safety. The court
shall enter the appropriate order which shall include written
findings of fact and conclusions of law and specify its effective
date;
6. An order entered pursuant to this subsection may be appealed
by either the consumer or the prosecuting agency to the Supreme Court
in accordance with the rules of the Supreme Court. The district
court, the Supreme Court, or the Court of Civil Appeals, if assigned,
may stay an order granting discharge, leave, visiting status, or
transfer pending appeal. On appeal, the district court’s findings of
facts shall be reviewed for an abuse of discretion while the legal
conclusions of the district court shall be reviewed de novo. If the
prosecuting agency appeals an order granting the consumer’s
discharge, leave, visiting status, or transfer and the order has been
stayed pending appeal, the appellate court shall resolve the appeal
in an expedited manner; and
7. The provisions of this subsection shall apply to all persons
subject to such terms regardless of whether the person’s criminal
charge or commitment occurred before or after the effective date of
this act.
G. The expense of returning a consumer from convalescent leave,
outpatient status or visiting status shall be that of:
1. The party removing the consumer from the facility; or
2. The Department. When it becomes necessary for the consumer
to be returned from the county where the consumer happens to be, the
Department shall reimburse the county pursuant to the provisions of
the State Travel Reimbursement Act.
ENR. S. B. NO. 1089 Page 18

G. H. In the event authorization is necessary to accomplish the
return of the consumer to the facility, such authority is hereby
vested in the judge of the district court in the county where the
consumer is located. Upon receipt of notice that the consumer needs
to be returned to the facility, the judge shall cause the consumer to
be brought before the court by issuance of a citation directed to the
consumer to appear and show cause why the consumer should not be
returned to the facility. The judge shall, if clear and convincing
evidence is presented by testimony under oath that the consumer
should be returned to the facility, enter an order returning the
consumer. If there is a lack of clear and convincing evidence
showing the necessity of such return, the consumer shall immediately
be released. Law enforcement officers are authorized to take into
custody, detain and transport a consumer pursuant to a citation or an
order of the judge of the district court.
H. I. An attending physician of any consumer admitted to a
private facility may discharge a consumer or permit the consumer to
leave the facility subject to the same provisions applicable to the
discharge or release of a consumer by the person in charge of a state
facility.
SECTION 5. This act shall become effective November 1, 2025.
