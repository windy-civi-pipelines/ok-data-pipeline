8 The facility granting a convalescent leave or visiting status to a
9 consumer has no responsibility in returning the consumer to the
10 facility should such become necessary. A convalescent leave or
11 visiting status may be granted rather than a discharge when the
12 complete recovery of the consumer can be determined only by
13 permitting the consumer to leave the facility. The person in charge
14 shall discharge a consumer who has not returned to the facility
15 within twelve (12) months from the time a convalescent leave or
16 visiting status was granted. Any return from convalescent leave or
17 visiting status must be on a voluntary basis.
18 D. In accordance with policies prescribed by the Commissioner, a
19 person in charge may transfer a consumer to an outpatient or other
20 nonhospital status when, in the opinion of the person in charge, such
21 transfer will not be detrimental to the public welfare or injurious
22 to the consumer and the necessary treatment may be continued on that
23 basis; provided, however, that before transferring the consumer, the
24 person in charge shall ensure that appropriate financial resources
ENGR. S. B. NO. 1089 Page 22

1 and appropriate services are available to receive and care for such
2 consumer after such transfer.
3 E. The person in charge of the facility shall notify the court
4 that committed the consumer that the consumer has been discharged.
5 Such notification shall be within forty-eight (48) hours after the
6 actual discharge.
7 F. If the consumer was committed after the dismissal of criminal
8 charges pursuant to the provisions of Section 1175.6a of Title 22 of
9 the Oklahoma Statutes:
10 1. The Department shall continue all appropriate efforts to
11 restore the consumer to competency as defined by Section 1175.1 of
12 Title 22 of the Oklahoma Statutes during the consumer’s commitment;
13 2. The Department shall evaluate the consumer for competency and
14 issue a written report detailing the consumer’s progress in regaining
15 competency to the attorney of the consumer, the district court that
16 dismissed the criminal action, and the district attorney or other
17 prosecuting agency that prosecuted the dismissed criminal action at
18 least once every year;
19 3. The Department shall notify the consumer, the attorney of the
20 consumer, the prosecuting agency that prosecuted the dismissed
21 criminal action, and the district court that committed the consumer
22 no less than sixty (60) days prior to any discharge, leave, granting
23 of visiting status, or transfer of the consumer. Contemporaneously
24 with the notice, the Department shall provide a written report
ENGR. S. B. NO. 1089 Page 23

1 eval uating the consumer’s risk to self and others if released, the
2 consumer’s status and progress in regaining competency, the
3 consumer’s current and historical compliance with medication and
4 treatment, and any discharge plan developed for the consumer;
5 4. The prosecuting agency that prosecuted the dismissed criminal
6 action may file with the district court that committed the consumer
7 an objection to the consumer’s discharge, leave, granting of visiting
8 status, or transfer within thirty (30) days of receipt of notice
9 pursuant to paragraph 3 of this subsection. The prosecuting agency
10 shall, regardless of whether an objection is filed, make reasonable
11 efforts to notify all alleged victims in the dismissed criminal
12 action, or if an alleged victim is deceased, his or her family, of
13 the Department’s planned discharge, leave, granting of visiting
14 status, or transfer of the consumer;
15 5. The court shall hold a hearing within thirty (30) days of the
16 filing of an objection by the prosecuting agency to determine whether
17 the consumer’s planned discharge, leave, granting of visiting status,
18 or transfer should occur. The consumer shall be entitled to counsel
19 at the hearing and in preparation for the hearing. If the consumer
20 does not have counsel, the court shall appoint an attorney to
21 represent the person at no cost if the person is indigent and cannot
22 afford an attorney. The hearing may be continued either by agreement
23 of the parties or upon good cause shown. The prosecuting agency
24 objecting to the consumer’s discharge, leave, granting of visiting
ENGR. S. B. NO. 1089 Page 24

1 stat us, or transfer shall bear the burden of proof, by clear and
2 convincing evidence, that the planned discharge, leave, granting of
3 visiting status, or transfer should not be granted. In the event of
4 a planned discharge pursuant to subsection B of this section, the
5 court shall determine whether the criteria contained within
6 subsection B of this section has been met. In the event of a
7 convalescent leave, granting of visiting status, or transfer pursuant
8 to subsection C or D of this section, the court shall determine
9 whether the applicable criteria have been met and whether the leave,
10 granting of visiting status, or transfer is in the best interest of
11 the consumer and in the best interest of public safety. The court
12 shall enter the appropriate order which shall include written
13 findings of fact and conclusions of law and specify its effective
14 date;
15 6. An order entered pursuant to this subsection may be appealed
16 by either the consumer or the prosecuting agency to the Supreme Court
17 in accordance with the rules of the Supreme Court. The district
18 court, the Supreme Court, or the Court of Civil Appeals, if assigned,
19 may stay an order granting discharge, leave, visiting status, or
20 transfer pending appeal. On appeal, the district court’s findings of
21 facts shall be reviewed for an abuse of discretion while the legal
22 conclusions of the district court shall be reviewed de novo. If the
23 prosecuting agency appeals an order granting the consumer’s
24 discharge, leave, visiting status, or transfer and the order has been
ENGR. S. B. NO. 1089 Page 25

1 stay ed pending appeal, the appellate court shall resolve the appeal
2 in an expedited manner; and
3 7. The provisions of this subsection shall apply to all persons
4 subject to such terms regardless of whether the person’s criminal
5 charge or commitment occurred before or after the effective date of
6 this act.
7 G. The expense of returning a consumer from convalescent leave,
8 outpatient status or visiting status shall be that of:
9 1. The party removing the consumer from the facility; or
10 2. The Department. When it becomes necessary for the consumer
11 to be returned from the county where the consumer happens to be, the
12 Department shall reimburse the county pursuant to the provisions of
13 the State Travel Reimbursement Act.
14 G. H. In the event authorization is necessary to accomplish the
15 return of the consumer to the facility, such authority is hereby
16 vested in the judge of the district court in the county where the
17 consumer is located. Upon receipt of notice that the consumer needs
18 to be returned to the facility, the judge shall cause the consumer to
19 be brought before the court by issuance of a citation directed to the
20 consumer to appear and show cause why the consumer should not be
21 returned to the facility. The judge shall, if clear and convincing
22 evidence is presented by testimony under oath that the consumer
23 should be returned to the facility, enter an order returning the
24 consumer. If there is a lack of clear and convincing evidence
ENGR. S. B. NO. 1089 Page 26

1 show ing the necessity of such return, the consumer shall immediately
2 be released. Law enforcement officers are authorized to take into
3 custody, detain and transport a consumer pursuant to a citation or an
4 order of the judge of the district court.
5 H. I. An attending physician of any consumer admitted to a
6 private facility may discharge a consumer or permit the consumer to
7 leave the facility subject to the same provisions applicable to the
8 discharge or release of a consumer by the person in charge of a state
9 facility.
