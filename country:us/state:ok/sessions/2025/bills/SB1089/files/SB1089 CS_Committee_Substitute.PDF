19 person in charge may transfer a consumer to an outpatient or other
20 nonhospital status when, in the opinion of the person in charge, such

23 basis; provided, however, that before transferring the consumer, the

10 shall, regardless of whether an objection is filed, make reasonable
11 efforts to notify all alleged victims in the dismissed criminal
12 action, or if an alleged victim is deceased, his or her family, of
13 the Department’s planned discharge, leave, granting of visiting
14 status, or transfer of the consumer;
15 5. The court shall hold a hearing within thirty (30) days of the
16 filing of an objection by the prosecuting agency to determine whether
17 the consumer’s planned discharge, leave, granting of visiting status,
18 or transfer should occur. The consumer shall be entitled to counsel
19 at the hearing and in preparation for the hearing. If the consumer
20 does not have counsel, the court shall appoint an attorney to
21 represent the person at no cost if the person is indigent and cannot
22 afford an attorney. The hearing may be continued either by agreement
23 of the parties or upon good cause shown. The prosecuting agency

3 visiting status, or transfer should not be granted. In the event of
4 a planned discharge pursuant to subsection B of this section, the
5 court shall determine whether the criteria contained within
6 subsection B of this section has been met. In the event of a
7 convalescent leave, granting of visiting status, or transfer pursuant
8 to subsection C or D of this section, the court shall determine
9 whether the applicable criteria have been met and whether the leave,
10 granting of visiting status, or transfer is in the best interest of
11 the consumer and in the best interest of public safety. The court
12 shall enter the appropriate order which shall include written
13 findings of fact and conclusions of law and specify its effective
14 date;
15 6. An order entered pursuant to this subsection may be appealed
16 by either the consumer or the prosecuting agency to the Supreme Court
17 in accordance with the rules of the Supreme Court. The district
18 court, the Supreme Court, or the Court of Civil Appeals, if assigned,
19 may stay an order granting discharge, leave, visiting status, or
20 transfer pending appeal. On appeal, the district court’s findings of
21 facts shall be reviewed for an abuse of discretion while the legal
22 conclusions of the district court shall be reviewed de novo. If the
23 prosecuting agency appeals an order granting the consumer’s
24 discharge, leave, visiting status, or transfer and the order has been
Req. No. 1689 Page 25

2 in an expedited manner; and
3 7. The provisions of this subsection shall apply to all persons
4 subject to such terms regardless of whether the person’s criminal
5 charge or commitment occurred before or after the effective date of
6 this act.

8 outpatient status or visiting status shall be that of:
9 1. The party removing the consumer from the facility; or
10 2. The Department. When it becomes necessary for the consumer
11 to be returned from the county where the consumer happens to be, the
12 Department shall reimburse the county pursuant to the provisions of
13 the State Travel Reimbursement Act.
14 G. H. In the event authorization is necessary to accomplish the
15 return of the consumer to the facility, such authority is hereby
16 vested in the judge of the district court in the county where the
17 consumer is located. Upon receipt of notice that the consumer needs
18 to be returned to the facility, the judge shall cause the consumer to
19 be brought before the court by issuance of a citation directed to the
20 consumer to appear and show cause why the consumer should not be
21 returned to the facility. The judge shall, if clear and convincing
22 evidence is presented by testimony under oath that the consumer
23 should be returned to the facility, enter an order returning the
24 consumer. If there is a lack of clear and convincing evidence
Req. No. 1689 Page 26

1 show ing the necessity of such return, the consumer shall immediately
2 be released. Law enforcement officers are authorized to take into
3 custody, detain and transport a consumer pursuant to a citation or an
4 order of the judge of the district court.
5 H. I. An attending physician of any consumer admitted to a
6 private facility may discharge a consumer or permit the consumer to
7 leave the facility subject to the same provisions applicable to the
8 discharge or release of a consumer by the person in charge of a state
9 facility.
10 SECTION 5. This act shall become effective November 1, 2025.
