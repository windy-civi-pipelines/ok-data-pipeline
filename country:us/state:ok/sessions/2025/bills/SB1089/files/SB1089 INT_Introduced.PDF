21

SECTION 1. AMENDATORY 22 O.S. 2021, Section 1175.2, is
22
23
amended to read as follows:
23
24
24
Req. No. 212 Page 1

1
Section 1175.2. A. No person shall be subject to any criminal
1
2
procedures after the person is determined to be incompetent except
2
3
as provided in Sections 1175.1 through 1175.8 and Section 2 of this
3
4
act of this title. The question of the incompetency of a person may
4
5
be raised by the person, the attorney for the person whose
5
6
competency is in question, or the district attorney, by an
6
7
application for determination of competency. The application for
7
8
determination of competency shall allege that the person is
8
9
incompetent to undergo further proceedings, and shall state facts
9
10
sufficient to raise a doubt as to the competency of the person. The
10
11
court, at any time, may initiate a competency determination on its
11
12
own motion, without an application, if the court has a doubt as to
12
13
the competency of the person.
13
14
If the court so initiates such an application, it may appoint
14
15
the district attorney for the purpose of proceeding with the
15
16
application. If the district attorney opposes the application of
16
17
the court, and by reason of a conflict of interest could not
17
18
represent the court as applicant, then the court shall appoint
18
19
private counsel. Said The private counsel shall be reasonably
19
20
compensated by the court fund.
20
21
B. A copy of the application for determination of competency
21
22
and a notice, as hereinafter described, in this section shall be
22
23
served personally at least one (1) day before the first hearing on
23
24
24
Req. No. 212 Page 2

3
4
competency and incompetency;
4
5
2. That, upon request, the hearing on the application may be
5
6
conducted as a jury trial as provided in Section 1175.4 of this
6
7
title;
7
8
3. That the petitioner and any witnesses identified in the
8
9
application may offer testimony under oath at the hearings on the
9
10
petition and that the defendant may not be called to testify against
10
11
the defendant’s will, unless the application is initiated by the
11
12
defendant;
12
13
4. That if the person whose competency is in question does not
13
14
have an attorney, the court will appoint an attorney for the person
14
15
who shall represent the person until final disposition of the case;
15
16
5. That if the person whose competency is in question is
16
17
indigent or poor, the court will pay the attorney fees; and
17
18
6. That the person whose competency is in question shall be
18
19
afforded such other rights as are guaranteed by state and federal
19
20
law and that such rights include a trial by jury, if demanded. The
20
21
notice shall be served upon the person whose competency is in
21
22
question, upon the person’s father, mother, husband, or wife or, in
22
23
their absence, someone of the next of kin, of full age, if any said
23
24
persons are known to be residing within the county, and upon any of
24
Req. No. 212 Page 3

said relatives residing outside of the county, and within the state,
1
2
as may be ordered by the court, and also upon the person with whom
2

the person whose competency is in question may reside, or at whose
3
4
house the person may be. The person making such service shall make
4
5
affidavit of the same and file such notice, with proof of service,
5
6
with the district court. This notice may be served in any part of
6
7
this state.
7
8
C. Any criminal proceedings against a person whose competency
8
9
is in question shall be suspended pending the determination of the
9
10
competency of the person.
10
11
D. Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 1175.1 through
11
12
1175.8 of this title, if a person whose competency is in question is
12

4
5
to determine the sufficiency of the evidence. The prosecutor and
5
6
the attorney for the person may introduce evidence relevant to the
6
7
question of the person’s guilt of the crime charged. The finding of
7
8
clear and convincing evidence may be based upon hearsay evidence in

participate in any stage of the proceedings.
