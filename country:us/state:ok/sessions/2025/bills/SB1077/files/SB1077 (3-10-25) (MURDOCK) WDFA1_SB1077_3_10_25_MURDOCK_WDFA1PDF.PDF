COMMITTEE AMENDMENT
(Date)
I move to amend Senate Bill No. 1077, page 2, lines 18-19, by removing paragraph 7 and replacing
with the following:
7. Any hunter harvested cervidae head and neck in transit into this state, or within the state from a
selective surveillance area, to a taxidermist who has an approved carcass disposal plan by the
Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation. The person transporting the carcass parts shall
obtain a transportation exemption permit from the Department prior to bringing the carcass into the
state or leaving the selective surveillance area. Taxidermists wishing to be granted an approved
carcass disposal plan may be requested to obtain proper chronic wasting disease samples for later
testing.
Amend title to conform
