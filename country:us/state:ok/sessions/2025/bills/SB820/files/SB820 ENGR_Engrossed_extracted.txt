10 in the state if the compensation is paid by an entity that does not
11 have its principal place of business in the state or that does not

17 and the results of the cost-benefit analysis. The Tax Commission
18 may require the qualified establishment to submit additional
19 information as may be necessary to administer the provisions of the

5 gross payroll of sports-league jobs for the establishment or entity
6 for the calendar quarter. The Tax Commission shall verify the

8 for such calendar quarter. If the Tax Commission is not able to
9 provide verification utilizing all available resources, the Tax
10 Commission may request additional information from the establishment
11 or entity as may be necessary or may request the establishment to
12 revise its claim. An establishment or entity may file for an
13 extension of the initial filing date with the Oklahoma Department of
14 Commerce. Any such extension shall be based solely upon an
15 extraordinary adverse business circumstance which prevented the
16 establishment or entity from hiring the sports-league jobs as
17 projected. If an establishment or entity fails to file claims as
18 required by this section, it shall forfeit the right to receive any
19 rebate payments after one (1) year from the start date. If an
20 establishment or entity has filed at least one claim pursuant to
21 this section but fails to file another claim within two (2) years of
22 the most recent claim, the Tax Commission, after consulting with the
23 Oklahoma Department of Commerce, may dismiss the establishment from

4 consecutive calendar quarters does not equal or exceed the
5 applicable total required by this act within three (3) years of the
6 start date, or does not equal or exceed the applicable total
7 required by Section 3604 of Title 68 of the Oklahoma Statutes at any
8 other time during the entire period after the start date for
9 establishments defined or classified in the NAICS Manual under U.S.

11 sports team from one of the five major sports leagues (NFL, NBA,
12 NHL, MLB, and MLS, WNBA, WPF, and NWSL), the rebate payments shall
13 not be made and shall not be resumed until such time as the actual
14 verified gross payroll equals or exceeds the applicable amounts
15 specified in Section 3604 of Title 68 of the Oklahoma Statutes. If
16 an establishment fails to achieve the required gross payroll within
17 three (3) years of the start date, the establishment shall not make
18 a new or renewal application for rebate payments authorized pursuant
19 to the Oklahoma Five Major Sports Leagues Rebate Program Act for a
20 period of twelve (12) months from the last day of the last month of
