Oklahoma Department of Commerce, may dismiss the establishment from
4

the program, forfeiting the right of the establishment or entity to
5

receive rebate payments based on that contract.

11
12
other time during the entire period after the start date for

15
16
NHL, MLB, and MLS, WNBA, WPF, and NWSL), the rebate payments shall

17
18
verified gross payroll equals or exceeds the applicable amounts
18
19
specified in Section 3604 of Title 68 of the Oklahoma Statutes. If
19
20
an establishment fails to achieve the required gross payroll within
20
21
three (3) years of the start date, the establishment shall not make
21
22
a new or renewal application for rebate payments authorized pursuant
22
23

23
24
period of twelve (12) months from the last day of the last month of

6
7
gross payroll as required by this section, the Tax Commission shall
7

issue a warrant to the establishment in the amount of the net
8

establishment or entity shall file a claim for the payment with the
8
9
Oklahoma Tax Commission and shall specify the actual number and
9
10
gross payroll of sports-league jobs for the establishment or entity
10
11
for the calendar quarter. The Tax Commission shall verify the
11
12
actual gross payroll for sports-league jobs for the establishment
12
13
for such calendar quarter. If the Tax Commission is not able to
13
14
provide verification utilizing all available resources, the Tax
14
15
Commission may request additional information from the establishment
15
16
or entity as may be necessary or may request the establishment to
16
17
revise its claim. An establishment or entity may file for an
17
18
extension of the initial filing date with the Oklahoma Department of
18
19
Commerce. Any such extension shall be based solely upon an
19
20
extraordinary adverse business circumstance which prevented the
20
21
establishment or entity from hiring the sports-league jobs as
21
22
projected. If an establishment or entity fails to file claims as
22
23
required by this section, it shall forfeit the right to receive any
23
24
rebate payments after one (1) year from the start date. If an
24
Req. No. 1092 Page 6

1
establishment or entity has filed at least one claim pursuant to
1
2
this section but fails to file another claim within two (2) years of
2
3
the most recent claim, the Tax Commission, after consulting with the
3
4
Oklahoma Department of Commerce, may dismiss the establishment from
4
5
the program, forfeiting the right of the establishment or entity to
5
6
receive rebate payments based on that contract.

B. If the actual verified gross payroll for four (4)
7
8
consecutive calendar quarters does not equal or exceed the
8
9
applicable total required by this act within three (3) years of the
9
10
start date, or does not equal or exceed the applicable total
10
11
required by Section 3604 of Title 68 of the Oklahoma Statutes at any
11
12
other time during the entire period after the start date for
12
13
establishments defined or classified in the NAICS Manual under U.S.
13
14
Industry No. 711211 (2007 version) and which are a professional
14
15
sports team from one of the five major sports leagues (NFL, NBA,
15
16
NHL, MLB, and MLS, WNBA, WPF, and NWSL), the rebate payments shall
16
17
not be made and shall not be resumed until such time as the actual
17
18
verified gross payroll equals or exceeds the applicable amounts
18
19
specified in Section 3604 of Title 68 of the Oklahoma Statutes. If
19
20
an establishment fails to achieve the required gross payroll within
20
21
three (3) years of the start date, the establishment shall not make
21
22
a new or renewal application for rebate payments authorized pursuant
22
23
to the Oklahoma Five Major Sports Leagues Rebate Program Act for a
23
24
period of twelve (12) months from the last day of the last month of
24
Req. No. 1092 Page 7

the three-year period during which the required gross payroll amount

3
4
estimated net direct state benefits or Ten Million Dollars

5
($10,000,000.00) in four (4) consecutive quarters.
5
6
D. As soon as practicable after verification of the actual
6
7
gross payroll as required by this section, the Tax Commission shall
7
8
issue a warrant to the establishment in the amount of the net
8
9
benefit rate multiplied by the actual gross payroll as determined
9
10
pursuant to subsection A of this section for the calendar quarter.

20
21
the net benefit rate provided by the Oklahoma Department of Commerce
21
22
by the gross payroll as determined pursuant to the provisions of
22

expended by the Tax Commission solely for the purposes and in the
