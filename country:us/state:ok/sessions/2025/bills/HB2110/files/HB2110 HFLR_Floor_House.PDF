4 A. The Legislature hereby finds that the production of live
5 audience episodic television in Oklahoma not only provides jobs for
6 Oklahomans and dollars for Oklahoma businesses, but also enhances
7 the state's image nationwide with a focus on authentic storytelling
8 targeting Middle America. The Legislature also finds that the
9 entertainment industry is always seeking economical locations that
10 can help cut the costs of production. The Legislature further finds
11 that the State of Oklahoma, with the appropriate incentive, can
12 become a strategic site for live audience episodic television
13 production, that serves as strategic retention for the production of
14 live audience epsiodic series in Oklahoma. It is therefore the
15 intent of the Legislature that Oklahoma provide a pilot program
16 incentive specifically for live audience episodic television
17 production in this state, carving out a niche in the industry that
18 Oklahoma can be known for.
