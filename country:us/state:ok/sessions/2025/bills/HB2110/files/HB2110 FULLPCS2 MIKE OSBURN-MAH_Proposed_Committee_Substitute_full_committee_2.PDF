1 SECTION 1. NEW LAW A new section of law to be codified
2 in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 3642.1 of Title 68, unless there
3 is created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:
4 This act shall be known and may be cited as the "Bringing
5 Sitcoms Home from Hollywood Pilot Program Act".
6 SECTION 2. NEW LAW A new section of law to be codified
7 in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 3642.2 of Title 68, unless there
8 is created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:
9 A. The Legislature hereby finds that the production of live
10 audience episodic television in Oklahoma not only provides jobs for
11 Oklahomans and dollars for Oklahoma businesses, but also enhances
12 the state's image nationwide with a focus on authentic storytelling
13 targeting Middle America. The Legislature also finds that the
14 entertainment industry is always seeking economical locations that
15 can help cut the costs of production. The Legislature further finds
16 that the State of Oklahoma, with the appropriate incentive, can
17 become a strategic site for live audience episodic television
18 production, that serves as strategic retention for the production of
19 live audience epsiodic series in Oklahoma. It is therefore the
20 intent of the Legislature that Oklahoma provide a pilot program
21 incentive specifically for live audience episodic television
22 production in this state, carving out a niche in the industry that
23 Oklahoma can be known for.
