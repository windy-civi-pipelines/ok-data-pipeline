3 faith and credit of the State of Oklahoma, the governmental entity
4 calling such election shall set forth in the call of election, in a
5 legally qualified newspaper of general circulation in the area
6 wherein said bond issue proceeds are to be expended, a general
7 statement of all purposes and specific projects for which seventy
8 percent (70%) of the proceeds shall be expended, with a further
9 listing of the dollar amounts to be expended on each specific
10 project. The dollar figure left unlisted as to specific projects
11 shall not exceed thirty percent (30%) of the total amount of the
12 bond issue.

21 however, that if any money becomes available from any source outside
22 the bond proceeds for any specific project, the outside funds would
23 be used to reduce the amount of bond funds to be expended on that
24 specific project. In such event, the governmental entity may expend
