last amended by Section 11, Chapter 236, O.S.L. 2024 (47 O.S. Supp.

Section 263:
Section 1137.1. A. Except for vehicles, travel trailers or
commercial trailers which display a current Oklahoma license tag,
upon the purchase or transfer of ownership of a used motor vehicle,
travel trailer or commercial trailer, including an out-of-state
purchase or transfer of the same, to a licensed used motor vehicle
dealer, wholesale used motor vehicle dealer, used travel trailer
dealer or used commercial trailer dealer, subsequently referred to
in this section as "dealer", the dealer shall affix a used dealer's
plate visible from the rear of the vehicle, travel trailer or
commercial trailer. Such license plate shall expire on December 31
of each year. When the vehicle, travel trailer or commercial
trailer is parked on the dealer's licensed place of business, it
shall not be required to have a license plate of any kind affixed.
A dealer shall obtain from Service Oklahoma at a cost of Ten Dollars
($10.00) a dealer license plate for demonstrating, transporting or
any other normal business of a dealer including use by an individual
holding a valid salesperson's license issued by the Oklahoma Used
Motor Vehicle, Dismantler, and Manufactured Housing Commission. Any
dealer who operates a wrecker or towing service licensed pursuant to

Section 264:
Sections 951 through 957 of this title shall register each wrecker
vehicle and display a wrecker license plate on each vehicle as
required by Section 1134.3 of this title. A dealer may obtain as
many additional license plates as may be desired upon the payment of
Ten Dollars ($10.00) for each additional license plate. Use of the
used dealer license plate by a licensed dealer for other than the
purposes as set forth herein shall constitute grounds for revocation
of the dealer's license. Service Oklahoma shall design the official
used dealer license plate to include the used dealer's license
number issued to him or her each year by Service Oklahoma or the
Oklahoma Used Motor Vehicle, Dismantler, and Manufactured Housing
Commission.
B. Upon the purchase or transfer of ownership of an out-of-
state used motor vehicle, travel trailer or commercial trailer to a
licensed dealer, the dealer shall make application for an Oklahoma
certificate of title pursuant to the Oklahoma Vehicle License and
Registration Act, Section 1101 et seq. of this title. Upon receipt
of the Oklahoma certificate of title, the dealer shall follow the
procedure as set forth in subsection A of this section. Provided,
nothing in this title shall be construed as requiring a dealer to
register a used motor vehicle, travel trailer or commercial trailer
ENR. H. B. NO. 1751 Page 67
purchased in another state which will not be operated or sold in
this state.
C. Upon sale or transfer of ownership of the used motor vehicle
or travel trailer, the dealer shall place upon the reassignment
portion of the certificate of title a tax stamp issued by the county
treasurer of the county in which the dealer has his or her primary
place of business. The tax stamp shall be issued upon payment of a
fee of Three Dollars and fifty cents ($3.50) and shall be in lieu of
the dealer's ad valorem tax on the inventories of used motor
vehicles or travel trailers but shall not relieve any other property
of the dealer from ad valorem taxation.
D. Upon sale of a used motor vehicle or travel trailer to
another licensed dealer, the selling dealer shall place the tax
stamp required in subsection C of this section upon the certificate
of title. The used dealer license plate or wholesale dealer license
plate shall be removed by the selling dealer. The purchasing dealer
shall, at time of purchase, place his or her dealer license plate on
the used motor vehicle, travel trailer or commercial trailer as
provided in subsection A of this section; provided, for vehicles,
travel trailers or commercial trailers purchased by a licensed used
dealer at an auction, in lieu of such placement of the dealer
license plate, the auction may provide temporary documentation as
approved by the Director of the Motor Vehicle Division of Service
Oklahoma for the purpose of transporting such vehicle to the
purchaser's point of destination. Such temporary documentation
shall be valid for two (2) days following the date of sale.
E. 1. The purchaser of every used motor vehicle, travel
trailer, or commercial trailer, except as otherwise provided by law,
shall obtain registration and title for the vehicle or trailer
within two (2) months from the date of purchase of same. It shall
be the responsibility of the selling dealer to place a temporary
license plate, in size similar to the permanent Oklahoma license
plate but of a ten-mil weatherproof plastic-impregnated paper
approved by the Oklahoma Used Motor Vehicle, Dismantler, and
Manufactured Housing Commission, upon a used motor vehicle, travel
trailer or commercial trailer when a transaction is completed for
the sale of such vehicle. Provided, upon a determination by the
Commission that there exists a national shortage of ten-mil
weatherproof plastic-impregnated paper, eight-mil weatherproof
plastic-impregnated paper may be approved by the Commission until it
has been determined by the Commission the shortage has ended. The
temporary license plate under this subsection shall be placed at the
ENR. H. B. NO. 1751 Page 68
location provided for the permanent motor vehicle license plate.
The temporary license plate shall show the license number which is
issued to the dealer each year by Service Oklahoma or the Oklahoma
Used Motor Vehicle, Dismantler, and Manufactured Housing Commission,
the date of expiration, and the company name of the selling dealer.

Section 265:
2. The Oklahoma Used Motor Vehicle, Dismantler, and
Manufactured Housing Commission is hereby directed to develop the
motor vehicle temporary license plate design to incorporate these
requirements in a manner that will permit law enforcement personnel
to readily identify the dealer license number and date of
expiration. The Oklahoma Used Motor Vehicle, Dismantler, and

dealer who operates a wrecker or towing service licensed pursuant to
Sections 951 through 957 of this title shall register each wrecker
vehicle and display a wrecker license plate on each vehicle as
required by Section 1134.3 of this title. A dealer may obtain as
many additional license plates as may be desired upon the payment of

used dealer license plate to include the used dealer's license
number issued to him or her each year by Service Oklahoma or the
Oklahoma Used Motor Vehicle, Dismantler, and Manufactured Housing
Commission.

this state.
C. Upon sale or transfer of ownership of the used motor vehicle
or travel trailer, the dealer shall place upon the reassignment
portion of the certificate of title a tax stamp issued by the county
treasurer of the county in which the dealer has his or her primary
place of business. The tax stamp shall be issued upon payment of a
fee of Three Dollars and fifty cents ($3.50) and shall be in lieu of
the dealer's ad valorem tax on the inventories of used motor
vehicles or travel trailers but shall not relieve any other property
of the dealer from ad valorem taxation.

dealer at an auction, in lieu of such placement of the dealer
license plate, the auction may provide temporary documentation as

Oklahoma for the purpose of transporting such vehicle to the
purchaser's point of destination. Such temporary documentation
shall be valid for two (2) days following the date of sale.
E. 1. The purchaser of every used motor vehicle, travel
trailer, or commercial trailer, except as otherwise provided by law,

plate but of a ten-mil weatherproof plastic-impregnated paper
approved by the Oklahoma Used Motor Vehicle, Dismantler, and
Manufactured Housing Commission, upon a used motor vehicle, travel
trailer or commercial trailer when a transaction is completed for
the sale of such vehicle. Provided, upon a determination by the
Commission that there exists a national shortage of ten-mil
weatherproof plastic-impregnated paper, eight-mil weatherproof
plastic-impregnated paper may be approved by the Commission until it
has been determined by the Commission the shortage has ended. The
temporary license plate under this subsection shall be placed at the
ENR. H. B. NO. 1751 Page 68

location provided for the permanent motor vehicle license plate.
The temporary license plate shall show the license number which is
issued to the dealer each year by Service Oklahoma or the Oklahoma
Used Motor Vehicle, Dismantler, and Manufactured Housing Commission,
the date of expiration, and the company name of the selling dealer.
2. The Oklahoma Used Motor Vehicle, Dismantler, and
Manufactured Housing Commission is hereby directed to develop the
motor vehicle temporary license plate design to incorporate these
requirements in a manner that will permit law enforcement personnel
to readily identify the dealer license number and date of
expiration. The Oklahoma Used Motor Vehicle, Dismantler, and
Manufactured Housing Commission is hereby authorized to develop
additional requirements and parameters as deemed appropriate to
discourage or prevent illegal duplication and use of the temporary
license plate. Such motor vehicle temporary license plate shall be
valid for a period of ten (10) days from the date of purchase. Use
of the motor vehicle temporary license plate by a dealer for other
than the purposes set forth herein shall constitute grounds for
revocation of the dealer's license to conduct business. Purchasers
of a commercial trailer shall affix the commercial trailer temporary
license plate to the rear of the commercial trailer. The purchaser
of a motor vehicle shall display the motor vehicle temporary license
plate for a period not to exceed ten (10) days or until registration
and title are obtained as provided in this section. The purchaser
of a commercial trailer shall display the commercial trailer
temporary license plate for a period not to exceed two (2) months or
until registration and title are obtained as provided in this
section.

shall apply to nonresidents who purchase a used motor vehicle,
travel trailer, or commercial trailer within this state that is to
be licensed in another state. The nonresident purchaser shall be
allowed to operate the vehicle or trailer within the state with a
temporary license plate for a period not to exceed ten (10) days
from date of purchase. Any nonresident purchaser found to be
operating a used motor vehicle, travel trailer, or commercial
trailer within this state after two (2) months shall be subject to
the registration fees of this state upon the same terms and
conditions applying to residents of this state. Additionally,
within two (2) business days of the date of the sale or transfer of
the vehicle or trailer, the parties shall submit the requisite
documentation to Service Oklahoma or licensed operator identifying
the vehicle or trailer subject to the sale or transfer, purchaser
ENR. H. B. NO. 1751 Page 69

information, and any associated license plate on the vehicle,
pursuant to the requirements of Section 1112.2 of this title.
F. It shall be unlawful for any dealer to procure the
registration and licensing of any used motor vehicle, travel trailer
or commercial trailer sold by the dealer or to act as the agent for
the purchaser in the procurement of the registration and licensing
of the purchaser's used vehicle, travel trailer, or commercial
trailer. A license of any dealer violating the provision of this
section may be revoked.
G. Dealers following the procedure set forth herein shall not
be required to register vehicles, travel trailers, or commercial
trailers to which this section applies, nor will the registration
fee otherwise required be assessed. Provided, dealers shall not
purchase or trade for a used motor vehicle, travel trailer, or
commercial trailer on which the registration therefor has been
expired for a period exceeding two (2) months without obtaining
current registration therefor.
H. A nonprofit charitable organization which is exempt from
taxation pursuant to the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, 26
U.S.C., Section 501(c)(3), and which accepts donations of used motor
vehicles previously titled in Oklahoma to be subsequently
transferred to another owner, upon the qualifying organization
providing sufficient documentation of its tax-exempt status, may
obtain from Service Oklahoma charitable nonprofit organization
license plates for demonstrating, transporting, or test-driving
donated vehicles, provided that no organization shall possess or use
at any one time more than eight such plates. Service Oklahoma shall
design distinctive license plates for that purpose. The cost for
such plates shall be the same as provided in subsection A of this
section for dealer plates.
I. The transfer of ownership from the vehicle donor to the
qualifying nonprofit organization described in subsection H of this

vehicles and motorcycles used exclusively off roads and highways
which occur on or after July 1, 2005, and upon transfers of legal
ownership of utility vehicles used exclusively off roads and
highways which occur on or after July 1, 2008. The excise tax for
new and used all-terrain vehicles, utility vehicles and motorcycles
used exclusively off roads and highways shall be levied at four and
one-half percent (4 1/2%) of the actual sales price of each new and
used all-terrain vehicle and motorcycle used exclusively off roads
and highways before any discounts or credits are given for a trade-
in. Provided, the minimum excise tax assessment for such all-
terrain vehicles, utility vehicles and motorcycles used exclusively
off roads and highways shall be Five Dollars ($5.00). The excise
tax for new vehicles shall be levied at three and one-fourth percent
(3 1/4%) of the value of each new vehicle. The excise tax for used
vehicles shall be as follows:
a. from October 1, 2000, until June 30, 2001, Twenty

($1,000.00) or less of value of such vehicle, and
three and one-fourth percent (3 1/4%) of the remaining
value of such vehicle,
b. for the year beginning July 1, 2001, and ending June
30, 2002, Twenty Dollars ($20.00) on the first One
Thousand Two Hundred Fifty Dollars ($1,250.00) or less
of value of such vehicle, and three and one-fourth
percent (3 1/4%) of the remaining value of such
vehicle, and
c. for the year beginning July 1, 2002, and all
subsequent years, Twenty Dollars ($20.00) on the first
One Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($1,500.00) or less
of value of such vehicle, and three and one-fourth
percent (3 1/4%) of the remaining value of such
vehicle.
2. There shall be levied an excise tax of Ten Dollars ($10.00)
for any:
a. truck or truck-tractor registered under the provisions
of subsection A of Section 1133 of Title 47 of the
Oklahoma Statutes, for a laden weight or combined

ENR. H. B. NO. 1751 Page 82

b. trailer or semitrailer registered under subsection C
of Section 1133 of Title 47 of the Oklahoma Statutes,
which is primarily designed to transport cargo over
the highways of this state and generally recognized as
such, and
c. frac tank, as defined by Section 54 of Title 17 of the
Oklahoma Statutes, and registered under subsection C
of Section 1133 of Title 47 of the Oklahoma Statutes.
Except for frac tanks, the excise tax levied pursuant to this
paragraph shall not apply to special mobilized machinery, trailers,
or semitrailers manufactured, modified or remanufactured for the
purpose of providing services other than transporting cargo over the
highways of this state. The excise tax levied pursuant to this
paragraph shall also not apply to pickup trucks, vans, or sport
utility vehicles.
3. The tax levied pursuant to this section shall be due at the
time of the transfer of legal ownership or first registration in
this state of such vehicle; provided, the tax shall not be due at
the time of the issuance of a certificate of title for an all-
terrain vehicle, utility vehicle or motorcycle used exclusively off
roads and highways which is not required to be registered but which
the owner chooses to register pursuant to the provisions of
subsection B of Section 1115.3 of Title 47 of the Oklahoma Statutes,
and shall be collected by Service Oklahoma or the Corporation
Commission, as applicable, or an appointed licensed operator, at the
time of the issuance of a certificate of title for any such vehicle.
In the event an excise tax is collected on the transfer of legal
ownership or use of the vehicle during any calendar year, then an
additional excise tax must be collected upon all subsequent
transfers of legal ownership. In computing the motor vehicle excise
tax, the amount collected shall be rounded to the nearest dollar.
The excise tax levied by this section shall be delinquent from and
after the thirtieth day after the legal ownership or possession of
any vehicle is obtained. Any person failing or refusing to pay the
tax as herein provided on or before date of delinquency shall pay in
addition to the tax a penalty of One Dollar ($1.00) per day for each
day of delinquency, but such penalty shall in no event exceed the
amount of the tax. Of each dollar penalty collected pursuant to
this subsection:
ENR. H. B. NO. 1751 Page 83

a. twenty-five cents ($0.25) fifty cents ($0.50) shall be
apportioned as provided in Section 1104 of this title,
and
b. twenty-five cents ($0.25) shall be retained by the
licensed operator, and

1120 of Title 47 of the Oklahoma Statutes and trailers and
semitrailers registered under subsection C of Section 1133 of Title
47 of the Oklahoma Statutes to transport cargo over the highways of
this state shall be in lieu of all sales and use taxes levied
pursuant to the Sales Tax Code or the Use Tax Code. The transfer of
legal ownership of any motor vehicle as used in this section and the
Sales Tax Code and the Use Tax Code shall include the lease, lease
purchase or lease finance agreement involving any truck in excess of
eight thousand (8,000) pounds combined laden weight or any truck-
tractor provided the vehicle is registered in Oklahoma pursuant to
Section 1120 of Title 47 of the Oklahoma Statutes or any frac tank,
trailer, semitrailer or open commercial vehicle registered pursuant
to Section 1133 of Title 47 of the Oklahoma Statutes. The excise
tax levied pursuant to this section shall not be subsequently
collected at the end of the lease period if the lessee acquires
complete legal title of the vehicle.
C. The provisions of this section shall not apply to transfers
made without consideration between:
1. Husband and wife;
2. Parent and child; or
3. An individual and an express trust which that individual or
the spouse, child or parent of that individual has a right to
revoke.
D. 1. There shall be a credit allowed with respect to the
excise tax paid for a new vehicle which is a replacement for:
ENR. H. B. NO. 1751 Page 84

a. a new original vehicle which is stolen from the
purchaser/registrant within ninety (90) days of the
date of purchase of the original vehicle as certified
by a police report or other documentation as required
by Service Oklahoma, or
b. a defective new original vehicle returned by the
purchaser/registrant to the seller within six (6)
months of the date of purchase of the defective new
original vehicle as certified by the manufacturer.
2. The credit allowed pursuant to paragraph 1 of this
subsection shall be in the amount of the excise tax which was paid
for the new original vehicle and shall be applied to the excise tax
due on the replacement vehicle. In no event shall the credit be
refunded.
E. Despite any other definitions of the terms "new vehicle" and
"used vehicle", to the contrary, contained in any other law, the
term "new vehicle" as used in this section shall also include any
vehicle of the latest manufactured model which is owned or acquired
by a licensed used motor vehicle dealer which has not previously
been registered in this state and upon which the motor vehicle
excise tax as set forth in this section has not been paid. However,
upon the sale or transfer by a licensed used motor vehicle dealer
located in this state of any such vehicle which is the latest
manufactured model, the vehicle shall be considered a used vehicle
for purposes of determining excise tax.
F. The provisions of this section shall not apply to state
government entities.
SECTION 24. REPEALER 47 O.S. 2021, Sections 6-110.2 and
1113.3, are hereby repealed.
SECTION 25. This act shall become effective July 1, 2025.
