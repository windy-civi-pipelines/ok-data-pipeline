Section 4:
SECTION 1: TITLE AND PURPOSE
1

This statute shall be known and cited as the “Dentist and Dental
2
3
Hygienist Compact”. The purposes of this Compact are to facilitate
3
4
the interstate practice of dentistry and dental hygiene and improve
4
5
public access to dentistry and dental hygiene services by providing
5
6
Dentists and Dental Hygienists licensed in a Participating State the
6
7
ability to practice in Participating States in which they are not
7
8
licensed. The Compact does this by establishing a pathway for
8
9
Dentists and Dental Hygienists licensed in a Participating State to
9
10
obtain a Compact Privilege that authorizes them to practice in
10
11
another Participating State in which they are not licensed. The
11
12
Compact enables Participating States to protect the public health
12
13
and safety with respect to the practice of such Dentists and Dental
13
14
Hygienists, through the State’s authority to regulate the practice
14
15
of dentistry and dental hygiene in the State. The Compact:
15
16
A. Enables Dentists and Dental Hygienists who qualify for a
16
17
Compact Privilege to practice in other Participating States without
17
18
satisfying burdensome and duplicative requirements associated with
18
19
securing a License to practice in those States.
19
20
B. Promotes mobility and addresses workforce shortages through
20
21
each Participating State’s acceptance of a Compact Privilege to
21
22
practice in that State.
22
23
23
24
24
Req. No. 137 Page 2

1
2
Dental Hygienists by creating a responsible, streamlined pathway for
2
3
Licensees to practice in Participating States.
3
4
D. Enhances the ability of Participating States to protect the
4
5
public’s health and safety.
5
6
E. Does not interfere with licensure requirements established
6
7
by a Participating State.
7
8
F. Facilitates the sharing of licensure and disciplinary
8
9
information among Participating States.
9
10
G. Requires Dentists and Dental Hygienists who practice in a
10
11
Participating State pursuant to a Compact Privilege to practice
11
12
within the Scope of Practice authorized in that State.
12
13
H. Extends the authority of a Participating State to regulate
13
14
the practice of dentistry and dental hygiene within its borders to
14
15
Dentists and Dental Hygienists who practice in the State through a
15
16
Compact Privilege.
16
17
I. Promotes the cooperation of Participating States in
17
18
regulating the practice of dentistry and dental hygiene within those
18
19
States.

7
8
and provisions of the Compact. A Commission Rule shall be invalid
8
9
and have no force or effect only if a court of competent
9
10
jurisdiction holds that the Rule is invalid because the Commission

16
the Commission conflict with the laws of the Participating State

17
that establish the Participating State’s Scope of Practice as held

7
8
interpretation of the Compact or Commission Rule and shall have

defaulting State may be terminated from the Compact upon an
2
3
affirmative vote of a majority of the Commissioners, and all rights,
3
4
privileges and benefits conferred on that State by this Compact may
4
5
be terminated on the effective date of termination. A cure of the

8
9
only after all other means of securing compliance have been

18
19
beyond the effective date of termination.
19
20
F. Upon the termination of a State’s participation in this
20
21
Compact, that State shall immediately provide notice to all
21
22
Licensees of the State, including Licensees of other Participating
22
23
States issued a Compact Privilege to practice within that State, of
23
24
such termination. The terminated State shall continue to recognize
24
Req. No. 137 Page 38

23
24
of any Participating State, a State seeking participation in the
24
Req. No. 137 Page 43
1
Compact, or of the United States, or the applicability thereof to

any government, agency, person or circumstance is held to be

constitutional requirement of a Participating State is a material

SECTION 1: TITLE AND PURPOSE

This statute shall be known and cited as the “Dentist and Dental
2
3
Hygienist Compact”. The purposes of this Compact are to facilitate
3
4
the interstate practice of dentistry and dental hygiene and improve
4
5
public access to dentistry and dental hygiene services by providing
5
6
Dentists and Dental Hygienists licensed in a Participating State the
6
7
ability to practice in Participating States in which they are not
7
8
licensed. The Compact does this by establishing a pathway for
8
9
Dentists and Dental Hygienists licensed in a Participating State to
9
10
obtain a Compact Privilege that authorizes them to practice in
10
11
another Participating State in which they are not licensed. The
11
12
Compact enables Participating States to protect the public health
12
13
and safety with respect to the practice of such Dentists and Dental
13
14
Hygienists, through the State’s authority to regulate the practice
14
15
of dentistry and dental hygiene in the State. The Compact:
15
16
A. Enables Dentists and Dental Hygienists who qualify for a
16
17
Compact Privilege to practice in other Participating States without
17
18
satisfying burdensome and duplicative requirements associated with
18
19
securing a License to practice in those States.
19
20
B. Promotes mobility and addresses workforce shortages through
20
21
each Participating State’s acceptance of a Compact Privilege to
21
22
practice in that State.
22
23
23
24
24
Req. No. 137 Page 2

1

2
Dental Hygienists by creating a responsible, streamlined pathway for
2
3
Licensees to practice in Participating States.
3
4
D. Enhances the ability of Participating States to protect the
4
5
public’s health and safety.
5
6
E. Does not interfere with licensure requirements established
6
7
by a Participating State.
7
8
F. Facilitates the sharing of licensure and disciplinary
8
9
information among Participating States.
9
10
G. Requires Dentists and Dental Hygienists who practice in a
10
11
Participating State pursuant to a Compact Privilege to practice
11
12
within the Scope of Practice authorized in that State.
12
13
H. Extends the authority of a Participating State to regulate
13
14
the practice of dentistry and dental hygiene within its borders to
14
15
Dentists and Dental Hygienists who practice in the State through a
15
16
Compact Privilege.
16
17
I. Promotes the cooperation of Participating States in
17
18
regulating the practice of dentistry and dental hygiene within those
18
19
States.
19
20
J. Facilitates the relocation of military members and their
20
21
spouses who are licensed to practice dentistry or dental hygiene.

6
7
effectively and efficiently implement and administer the purposes
7
8
and provisions of the Compact. A Commission Rule shall be invalid
8
9
and have no force or effect only if a court of competent
9
10
jurisdiction holds that the Rule is invalid because the Commission
10
11
exercised its rulemaking authority in a manner that is beyond the
11
12
scope and purposes of the Compact, or the powers granted hereunder,
12
13
or based upon another applicable standard of review.
13
14
B. The Rules of the Commission shall have the force of law in
14
15
each Participating State; provided, however, that where the Rules of
15
16
the Commission conflict with the laws of the Participating State
16
17
that establish the Participating State’s Scope of Practice as held
17
18
by a court of competent jurisdiction, the Rules of the Commission
18
19
shall be ineffective in that State to the extent of the conflict.
19
20
C. The Commission shall exercise its Rulemaking powers pursuant
20
21
to the criteria set forth in this section and the Rules adopted
21
22

3
enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to

13
all written comments and documents received by the Commission in
13
14
response to the proposed Rule shall be available to the public.
14
15
J. Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a
15
16
separate hearing on each Commission Rule. Rules may be grouped for
16
17
the convenience of the Commission at hearings required by this
17
18
section.
18
19
K. The Commission shall, by majority vote of all Commissioners,

20
take final action on the proposed Rule based on the rulemaking
20
21

21
22
1. The Commission may adopt changes to the proposed Rule

23
provided the changes do not enlarge the original purpose of the
23
24
proposed Rule.
24
Req. No. 137 Page 34

1
2. The Commission shall provide an explanation of the reasons
1
2
for substantive changes made to the proposed Rule as well as reasons
2
3
for substantive changes not made that were recommended by
3

5
6
for the Rule. Except for an emergency as provided in subsection L

7
8
than thirty (30) days after the Commission issuing the notice that
8
9
it adopted or amended the Rule.
9
10
L. Upon determination that an emergency exists, the Commission
10
11
may consider and adopt an emergency Rule with twenty-four (24)
11
12
hours’ notice, with opportunity to comment, provided that the usual

M. The Commission or an authorized committee of the Commission
1
2

2
3
correcting typographical errors, errors in format, errors in

4
5
shall be posted on the website of the Commission. The revision
5
6
shall be subject to challenge by any person for a period of thirty
6
7
(30) days after posting. The revision may be challenged only on
7
8
grounds that the revision results in a material change to a Rule. A
8
9
challenge shall be made in writing and delivered to the Commission
9
10
prior to the end of the notice period. If no challenge is made, the
10
11
revision will take effect without further action. If the revision
11
12
is challenged, the revision may not take effect without the approval
12
13
of the Commission.
13
14
N. No Participating State’s rulemaking requirements shall apply
14
15
under this Compact.
15
16
SECTION 10: OVERSIGHT, DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AND ENFORCEMENT
16
17
A. Oversight.
17
18
1. The executive and judicial branches of State government in
18
19
each Participating State shall enforce this Compact and take all
19
20
actions necessary and appropriate to implement the Compact.
20
21
2. Venue is proper and judicial proceedings by or against the
21
22
Commission shall be brought solely and exclusively in a court of
22
23
competent jurisdiction where the principal office of the Commission
23
24
is located. The Commission may waive venue and jurisdictional
24
Req. No. 137 Page 36

1
defenses to the extent it adopts or consents to participate in
1
2
alternative dispute resolution proceedings. Nothing herein shall
2
3
affect or limit the selection or propriety of venue in any action
3
4
against a Licensee for professional malpractice, misconduct or any
4
5
such similar matter.
5
6
3. The Commission shall be entitled to receive service of
6
7
process in any proceeding regarding the enforcement or
7
8
interpretation of the Compact or Commission Rule and shall have
8
9
standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all purposes.
9
10
Failure to provide the Commission service of process shall render a
10
11
judgment or order void as to the Commission, this Compact, or
11
12
promulgated Rules.
12
13
B. Default, Technical Assistance, and Termination.
13
14
1. If the Commission determines that a Participating State has
14
15
defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities
15
16
under this Compact or the promulgated Rules, the Commission shall
16
17
provide written notice to the defaulting State. The notice of
17
18
default shall describe the default, the proposed means of curing the
18
19
default, and any other action that the Commission may take, and
19
20
shall offer training and specific technical assistance regarding the
20
21
default.
21
22
2. The Commission shall provide a copy of the notice of default
22
23
to the other Participating States.
23
24
24
Req. No. 137 Page 37

1
C. If a State in default fails to cure the default, the
1
2
defaulting State may be terminated from the Compact upon an
2
3
affirmative vote of a majority of the Commissioners, and all rights,
3
4
privileges and benefits conferred on that State by this Compact may
4
5
be terminated on the effective date of termination. A cure of the
5
6
default does not relieve the offending State of obligations or
6
7
liabilities incurred during the period of default.
7
8
D. Termination of participation in the Compact shall be imposed
8
9
only after all other means of securing compliance have been
9
10
exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given
10
11
by the Commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders
11
12
of the defaulting State’s legislature, the defaulting State’s State
12
13
Licensing Authority or Authorities, as applicable, and each of the
13
14
Participating States’ State Licensing Authority or Authorities, as
14
15
applicable.
15
16
E. A State that has been terminated is responsible for all
16
17
assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the
17
18
effective date of termination, including obligations that extend
18
19
beyond the effective date of termination.
19
20
F. Upon the termination of a State’s participation in this
20
21
Compact, that State shall immediately provide notice to all
21
22
Licensees of the State, including Licensees of other Participating
22
23
States issued a Compact Privilege to practice within that State, of
23
24
such termination. The terminated State shall continue to recognize
24
Req. No. 137 Page 38

1
all Compact Privileges then in effect in that State for a minimum of
1
2
one hundred eighty (180) days after the date of said notice of
2
3
termination.
3
4
G. The Commission shall not bear any costs related to a State
4
5
that is found to be in default or that has been terminated from the
5
6
Compact, unless agreed upon in writing between the Commission and
6
7
the defaulting State.
7
8
H. The defaulting State may appeal the action of the Commission
8
9
by petitioning the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia
9
10
or the federal district where the Commission has its principal
10
11
offices. The prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such
11
12
litigation, including reasonable attorney’s fees.
12
13
I. Dispute Resolution.
13
14
1. Upon request by a Participating State, the Commission shall
14
15
attempt to resolve disputes related to the Compact that arise among
15
16
Participating States and between Participating States and non-
16
17
Participating States.
17
18
2. The Commission shall promulgate a Rule providing for both
18
19
mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes as
19
20
appropriate.
20
21
J. Enforcement.
21
22
1. The Commission, in the reasonable exercise of its
22
23
discretion, shall enforce the provisions of this Compact and the
23
24
Commission’s Rules.
24
Req. No. 137 Page 39

1
2. By majority vote, the Commission may initiate legal action
1
2
against a Participating State in default in the United States
2
3
District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district
3
4
where the Commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance
4
5
with the provisions of the Compact and its promulgated Rules. The
5
6
relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In
6
7
the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party
7
8
shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable
8
9
attorney’s fees. The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive
9
10
remedies of the Commission. The Commission may pursue any other
10
11
remedies available under federal or the defaulting Participating
11
12
State’s law.
12
13
3. A Participating State may initiate legal action against the
13
14
Commission in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia
14
15
or the federal district where the Commission has its principal
15
16
offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the Compact and
16
17
its promulgated Rules. The relief sought may include both
17
18
injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is
18
19
necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such
19
20
litigation, including reasonable attorney’s fees.
20
21
4. No individual or entity other than a Participating State may
21
22
enforce this Compact against the Commission.

Compact, the Commission shall remain in existence and
16
17
the Compact shall remain in effect even if the number
17
18
of Participating States should be less than seven (7).
18
19
2. Participating States enacting the Compact subsequent to the
19
20
Charter Participating States shall be subject to the process set
20
21
forth in Section 7.C.23 to determine if their enactments are
21
22
materially different from the Model Compact and whether they qualify
22
23
for participation in the Compact.
23
24
24
Req. No. 137 Page 41

1
3. All actions taken for the benefit of the Commission or in
1
2
furtherance of the purposes of the administration of the Compact
2
3

15
A. This Compact and the Commission’s rulemaking authority shall
15
16
be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes and the
16
17
implementation and administration of the Compact. Provisions of the
17
18
Compact expressly authorizing or requiring the promulgation of Rules
18
19
shall not be construed to limit the Commission’s rulemaking
19
20
authority solely for those purposes.
20
21
B. The provisions of this Compact shall be severable and if any
21
22
phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this Compact is held by a
22
23
court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to the constitution
23
24
of any Participating State, a State seeking participation in the
24
Req. No. 137 Page 43

1
Compact, or of the United States, or the applicability thereof to
1
2
any government, agency, person or circumstance is held to be
2
3
unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, the validity
3
4
of the remainder of this Compact and the applicability thereof to
4
5
any other government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be
5
6
affected thereby.
6
7
C. Notwithstanding subsection B of this section, the Commission
7
8
may deny a State’s participation in the Compact or, in accordance
8
9
with the requirements of Section 10.B, terminate a Participating
9
10
State’s participation in the Compact, if it determines that a
10
11
constitutional requirement of a Participating State is a material
11
12
departure from the Compact. Otherwise, if this Compact shall be
12
13
held to be contrary to the constitution of any Participating State,
13
14
the Compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the
14
15
remaining Participating States and in full force and effect as to
15
16
the Participating State affected as to all severable matters.
16
17
SECTION 13: CONSISTENT EFFECT AND CONFLICT WITH OTHER STATE
17
18
LAWS
18
19

any other law of a Participating State that is not inconsistent with
20

22
23
in a Participating State in conflict with the Compact are superseded
