1 DENTIST AND DENTAL HYGIENIST COMPACT
2 SECTION 1: TITLE AND PURPOSE
3 This statute shall be known and cited as the “Dentist and Dental
4 Hygienist Compact”. The purposes of this Compact are to facilitate
5 the interstate practice of dentistry and dental hygiene and improve
6 public access to dentistry and dental hygiene services by providing
7 Dentists and Dental Hygienists licensed in a Participating State the
8 ability to practice in Participating States in which they are not
9 licensed. The Compact does this by establishing a pathway for
10 Dentists and Dental Hygienists licensed in a Participating State to
11 obtain a Compact Privilege that authorizes them to practice in
12 another Participating State in which they are not licensed. The
13 Compact enables Participating States to protect the public health
14 and safety with respect to the practice of such Dentists and Dental
15 Hygienists, through the State’s authority to regulate the practice
16 of dentistry and dental hygiene in the State. The Compact:
17 A. Enables Dentists and Dental Hygienists who qualify for a
18 Compact Privilege to practice in other Participating States without
19 satisfying burdensome and duplicative requirements associated with
20 securing a License to practice in those States.
21 B. Promotes mobility and addresses workforce shortages through
22 each Participating State’s acceptance of a Compact Privilege to
23 practice in that State.
24
SENATE FLOOR VERSION - SB540 SFLR Page 2

2 Dental Hygienists by creating a responsible, streamlined pathway for
3 Licensees to practice in Participating States.
4 D. Enhances the ability of Participating States to protect the
5 public’s health and safety.
6 E. Does not interfere with licensure requirements established
7 by a Participating State.
8 F. Facilitates the sharing of licensure and disciplinary
9 information among Participating States.
10 G. Requires Dentists and Dental Hygienists who practice in a
11 Participating State pursuant to a Compact Privilege to practice
12 within the Scope of Practice authorized in that State.
13 H. Extends the authority of a Participating State to regulate
14 the practice of dentistry and dental hygiene within its borders to
15 Dentists and Dental Hygienists who practice in the State through a
16 Compact Privilege.
17 I. Promotes the cooperation of Participating States in
18 regulating the practice of dentistry and dental hygiene within those

7 process in any proceeding regarding the enforcement or

(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)

1 DENTIST AND DENTAL HYGIENIST COMPACT
2 SECTION 1: TITLE AND PURPOSE
3 This statute shall be known and cited as the “Dentist and Dental
4 Hygienist Compact”. The purposes of this Compact are to facilitate
5 the interstate practice of dentistry and dental hygiene and improve
6 public access to dentistry and dental hygiene services by providing
7 Dentists and Dental Hygienists licensed in a Participating State the
8 ability to practice in Participating States in which they are not
9 licensed. The Compact does this by establishing a pathway for
10 Dentists and Dental Hygienists licensed in a Participating State to
11 obtain a Compact Privilege that authorizes them to practice in
12 another Participating State in which they are not licensed. The
13 Compact enables Participating States to protect the public health
14 and safety with respect to the practice of such Dentists and Dental
15 Hygienists, through the State’s authority to regulate the practice
16 of dentistry and dental hygiene in the State. The Compact:
17 A. Enables Dentists and Dental Hygienists who qualify for a
18 Compact Privilege to practice in other Participating States without
19 satisfying burdensome and duplicative requirements associated with
20 securing a License to practice in those States.
21 B. Promotes mobility and addresses workforce shortages through
22 each Participating State’s acceptance of a Compact Privilege to
23 practice in that State.
24
SENATE FLOOR VERSION - SB540 SFLR Page 2
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)

1 C. Increases public access to qualified, licensed Dentists and
2 Dental Hygienists by creating a responsible, streamlined pathway for
3 Licensees to practice in Participating States.
4 D. Enhances the ability of Participating States to protect the
5 public’s health and safety.
6 E. Does not interfere with licensure requirements established
7 by a Participating State.
8 F. Facilitates the sharing of licensure and disciplinary
9 information among Participating States.
10 G. Requires Dentists and Dental Hygienists who practice in a
11 Participating State pursuant to a Compact Privilege to practice
12 within the Scope of Practice authorized in that State.
13 H. Extends the authority of a Participating State to regulate
14 the practice of dentistry and dental hygiene within its borders to
15 Dentists and Dental Hygienists who practice in the State through a
16 Compact Privilege.
17 I. Promotes the cooperation of Participating States in
18 regulating the practice of dentistry and dental hygiene within those
19 States.

21 spouses who are licensed to practice dentistry or dental hygiene.

1 3. All actions taken for the benefit of the Commission or in
2 furtherance of the purposes of the administration of the Compact

6 4. Any State that joins the Compact subsequent to the
7 Commission’s initial adoption of the Rules and bylaws shall be
8 subject to the Commission’s Rules and bylaws as they exist on the
9 date on which the Compact becomes law in that State. Any Rule that

11 force and effect of law on the day the Compact becomes law in that
12 State.

14 enacting a statute repealing that State’s enactment of the Compact.

16 until one hundred eighty (180) days after enactment of the repealing
17 statute.

(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)

1 subs equent statutory enactment to the contrary, such withdrawing
2 State shall continue to recognize all Compact Privileges to practice
3 within that State granted pursuant to this Compact for a minimum of
4 one hundred eighty (180) days after the date of such notice of
5 withdrawal.
6 C. Nothing contained in this Compact shall be construed to
7 invalidate or prevent any licensure agreement or other cooperative
8 arrangement between a Participating State and a non-Participating
9 State that does not conflict with the provisions of this Compact.
10 D. This Compact may be amended by the Participating States. No
11 amendment to this Compact shall become effective and binding upon
12 any Participating State until it is enacted into the laws of all
13 Participating States.
14 SECTION 12: CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY
15 A. This Compact and the Commission’s rulemaking authority shall
16 be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes and the
17 implementation and administration of the Compact. Provisions of the
18 Compact expressly authorizing or requiring the promulgation of Rules
19 shall not be construed to limit the Commission’s rulemaking
20 authority solely for those purposes.
21 B. The provisions of this Compact shall be severable and if any
22 phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this Compact is held by a
23 court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to the constitution
24 of any Participating State, a State seeking participation in the
SENATE FLOOR VERSION - SB540 SFLR Page 43
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)

1 Comp act, or of the United States, or the applicability thereof to
2 any government, agency, person or circumstance is held to be
3 unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, the validity
4 of the remainder of this Compact and the applicability thereof to
5 any other government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be
6 affected thereby.
7 C. Notwithstanding subsection B of this section, the Commission
8 may deny a State’s participation in the Compact or, in accordance
9 with the requirements of Section 10.B, terminate a Participating
10 State’s participation in the Compact, if it determines that a
11 constitutional requirement of a Participating State is a material
12 departure from the Compact. Otherwise, if this Compact shall be
13 held to be contrary to the constitution of any Participating State,
14 the Compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the
15 remaining Participating States and in full force and effect as to
16 the Participating State affected as to all severable matters.
17 SECTION 13: CONSISTENT EFFECT AND CONFLICT WITH OTHER STATE
18 LAWS
19 A. Nothing herein shall prevent or inhibit the enforcement of
20 any other law of a Participating State that is not inconsistent with
21 the Compact.
22 B. Any laws, statutes, regulations, or other legal requirements
23 in a Participating State in conflict with the Compact are superseded
24 to the extent of the conflict.
