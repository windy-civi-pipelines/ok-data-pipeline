15
coordinator for the participating employer in such form and manner
15

18
19
or office for which compensation for service is paid from levies or

in any calendar year. This subsection shall not apply to service
1
2
rendered by a retiree as a juror, as a witness in any legal
2
3
proceeding or action, as an election board judge or clerk, or in any
3
4
other office or position of a similar nature, or to an employer that

5
is not a participating employer. Provided, further, that any
5
6
participating employer who is employing such a retiree shall make
6
7
proper written notification to the System informing it of the
7
8
beginning date of such retiree’s employment and the date such

10
the calendar year. Any retiree returning to work for a

12
the employer shall do likewise. All retirees who have returned to
12
13
employment and participation in the System following retirement
13
14
shall have post-retirement benefits calculated on one of the
14
15
following methods:
15
16
1. All service accumulated from date of reemployment shall be
16
17
computed based on the benefit formula applicable at that time and
17
18
the additional benefits shall be added to the previous benefits.
18
19
Such additional benefits shall be calculated each year based upon
19
20
additional service accrued from July 1 to June 30 of the previous
20
21
year and the additional benefit, if any, will be added to the
21
22
retiree’s monthly benefit beginning January 1, 2000, and each
22
23
January 1 thereafter. However, the post-retirement service credit
23
24
shall be cumulative, beginning with service credit accrued after the
24
Req. No. 1056 Page 4

RBS No. 1056
1
date of retirement, provided that the retiree has not received a
1
2
distribution of the post-retirement contributions.;
2
3
2. Any retiree who returns to employment with a participating
3
4
employer may elect not to receive any retirement benefits while so
4
5
reemployed. If such an election is made and reemployment is for a
5
6
minimum period of thirty-six (36) consecutive months, all service
6
7
accumulated from date of reemployment shall be participating
7
8
service. For purposes of determining the retirement benefits of
8
9
such a member upon the termination of such reemployment all
9
10
creditable service of the member shall be computed based on the
10
11
benefit formula applicable at the time of termination of such
11
12
reemployment. Provided, a retiree who became reemployed prior to
12
13
July 1, 1982, and who is reemployed for a minimum of thirty-six (36)
13
14
consecutive months shall have all the creditable service of such
14
15
retiree computed based on the benefit formula applicable at the time
15
16
of termination of such reemployment if the retiree elects not to
16
17
receive retirement benefits prior to such termination of
17
18
reemployment. A retiree who has waived receipt of the monthly
18
19
benefit, but is not reemployed for the full thirty-six (36)
19
20
consecutive months, shall upon termination of such reemployment have
20
21
only the additional amount added to his or her benefit as if they
21
22
had not waived the benefit as provided in paragraph 1 of this
22
23
subsection.;

3. All post-retirement additional benefits shall be calculated
1
2
using actual hours worked as well as the actual compensation
2
3
received and upon which contributions are paid. Post-retirement
3
4
service is not subject to the partial year round-up provisions of
4
5
subsection C of Section 913 of this title.; or
5
6
4. A retired member who returns to work for a participating
6
7
employer pursuant to this section shall be bound by the election
7
8
made pursuant to paragraph (2) of subsection A of Section 915 of
8
9
this title if the member had made such election prior to retirement.
9
10
If the member had not made such election prior to retirement, the
10
11
member may do so during the member’s reemployment with a
11
12
participating employer pursuant to this section. A retired member
12
13
may not be rehired by their former employer, nor may the retired
13
14
member be permitted to enter into an employment contract of any kind
14
15
with a former employer, for a period of one (1) year six months
15
16
after the retired member ended his or her employment with the former
16
17
employer unless the retired member waives his or her benefit under
17
18
paragraph 2 of this subsection and returns as a bona fide employee.
18
19
F. Except as otherwise provided by subsection G of this
19
20
section, any member may elect to retire before his or her normal
20
21
retirement date on the first day of any month coinciding with or
21
22
following the attainment of age fifty-five (55), provided such
22
