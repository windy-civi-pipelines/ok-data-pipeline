1 BE I T ENACTED BY THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF OKLAHOMA:
2 SECTION 1. NEW LAW A new section of law not to be
3 codified in the Oklahoma Statutes reads as follows:
4 In recognition of the critical role social media plays in the
5 lives of minors and its impact on their mental well-being, this
6 Legislature is committed to safeguarding the youth from accessing
7 platforms that have demonstrated adverse effects on their mental
8 health due to the addictive elements found in social media and the
9 targeting of minors through the use of algorithms by social media
10 platforms. This Legislature's intent is not to censor content found
11 on social media platforms, but rather to prevent access by persons
12 who have not yet reached an age to handle the negative aspects of
13 social media. Much like our historical commitment to curbing the
14 use of addictive substances and behaviors among minors, such as laws
15 regulating the use of intoxicants and gambling, this Legislature now
16 takes proactive measures to address the emerging challenges posed by
17 social media platforms.

19 in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 120 of Title 25, unless there is
