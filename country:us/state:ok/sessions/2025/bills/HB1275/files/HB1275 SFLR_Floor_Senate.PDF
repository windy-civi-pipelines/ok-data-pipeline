16 SECTION 1. NEW LAW A new section of law not to be
17 codified in the Oklahoma Statutes reads as follows:
18 In recognition of the critical role social media plays in the
19 lives of minors and its impact on their mental well-being, this
20 Legislature is committed to safeguarding the youth from accessing
21 platforms that have demonstrated adverse effects on their mental
22 health due to the addictive elements found in social media and the
23 targeting of minors through the use of algorithms by social media
24 platforms. This Legislature's intent is not to censor content found
