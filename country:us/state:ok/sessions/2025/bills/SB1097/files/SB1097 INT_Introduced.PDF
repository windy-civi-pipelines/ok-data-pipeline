be assessed for each individual record, or portion thereof requested

fee only for recovery of the reasonable, direct costs of record
12
13
copying, or mechanical reproduction. Notwithstanding any state or
13
14
local provision to the contrary, in no instance shall the record

15
copying fee exceed twenty-five cents ($0.25) per page for records

21
essential functions of the public body,
21
22
then the public body may charge a reasonable fee to recover the
22
23
direct cost of record search and copying; however, publication in a
23
24
newspaper or broadcast by news media for news purposes shall not
24
Req. No. 1333 Page 6

1
constitute a resale or use of a record for trade or commercial
1
2
purpose and charges for providing copies of electronic data to the
2
3
news media for a news purpose shall not exceed the direct cost of
3
4
making the copy. The fee charged by the Department of Public Safety
4
5
for a copy in a computerized format of a record of the Department
5
6
shall not exceed the direct cost of making the copy unless the fee

8
9
written schedule of the fees at its principal office and with the
9
10
county clerk.
10
11
In no case shall a search fee be charged when the release of
11
12
records is in the public interest, including, but not limited to,
12
13
release to the news media, scholars, authors and taxpayers seeking
13
14
to determine whether those entrusted with the affairs of the
14
15
government are honestly, faithfully, and competently performing
15
16
their duties as public servants.
16
17
The fees shall not be used for the purpose of discouraging
17
18
requests for information or as obstacles to disclosure of requested
18
19
information;
19
20
5. The land description tract index of all recorded instruments
20
21
concerning real property required to be kept by the county clerk of

Req. No. 1333 Page 7

provided, however, the index shall not be copied or mechanically
1
2
reproduced for the purpose of sale of the information;
2
3
6. A public body must provide prompt, reasonable access to its
3
4
records but may establish reasonable procedures which protect the
4
5
integrity and organization of its records and to prevent excessive
5
6
disruptions of its essential functions. A delay in providing access
6
7
to records shall be limited solely to the time required for
7
8
preparing the requested documents and the avoidance of excessive
8
9
disruptions of the public body’s essential functions. If a records
9
10
request cannot be completed within ten (10) business days of the
10
11
request, a person designated pursuant to paragraph 7 of this section
11
12
shall provide written notice to the requestor indicating the reason
12
13
for the delay and specifying a date within a reasonable time when
13
14
the information requested will be available for inspection or
14
15
duplication. In no event may production of a current request for
15
16
records be unreasonably delayed until after completion of a prior
16
17
records request that will take substantially longer than the current
17
18
request. Any public body which makes the requested records
18
19
available on the Internet shall meet the obligation of providing
19
20
prompt, reasonable access to its records as required by this
20
21
paragraph; and
21
22
7. A public body shall designate certain persons who are
22
23
authorized to release records of the public body for inspection,
23
24
copying, or mechanical reproduction. At least one person shall be
24
Req. No. 1333 Page 8

business hours of the public body.
