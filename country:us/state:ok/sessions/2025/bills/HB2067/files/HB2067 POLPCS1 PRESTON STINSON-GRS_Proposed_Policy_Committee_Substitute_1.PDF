Req. No. 12416 Page 1

1 1. "Favorable" means that there is a reasonable probability
2 that the outcome of the proceeding would have been different;
3 2. "Forensic science" is the application of scientific or
4 technical practices to the recognition, collection, analysis, and
5 interpretation of evidence for criminal and civil law or regulatory
6 issues;
7 3. "Forensic scientific evidence" shall include:
8 a. scientific or technical knowledge,
9 b. scientific or technical knowledge or opinion by a
10 testifying forensic analyst or expert,
11 c. reports or testimony offered by experts or forensic
12 analysts,
13 d. scientific standards, or
14 e. a scientific method or technique upon which the
15 relevant forensic scientific evidence is based; and
16 4. "Scientific knowledge" shall include the knowledge of the
17 general scientific community and all fields of scientific knowledge
18 on which those fields or disciplines rely.
19 B. The provisions of this section applies to relevant forensic

1 C. The district court in which a person was convicted may grant
2 a convicted person relief if:
3 1. The convicted person files an application under the
4 provisions of this section asserting that relevant forensic
5 scientific evidence is currently available and either:
6 a. was not ascertainable through the exercise of
7 reasonable diligence by the convicted person before or
8 during trial, or
9 b. undermines forensic scientific evidence presented at
10 trial; and
11 2. The court makes the findings described by subdivision (1) of
12 paragraph 1 of this section and finds that, had the evidence been
13 presented at trial, there is a reasonable likelihood there would
14 have been a different outcome at the trial.
15 D. In determining whether relevant forensic scientific evidence
16 was not ascertainable through the exercise of reasonable diligence
17 on or before a specific date, the court shall consider whether the
18 relevant scientific evidence has changed since:

20 guilty plea or nolo contendere plea, for a determination made with
21 respect to an original application; or

2 liabilities for an expert who repudiates his or her original opinion
3 provided at a hearing or trial or whose opinion has been undermined
4 by later scientific research or technological advancements.
5 F. A person convicted of a crime who asserts that he or she did
6 not commit that crime may file a petition relating to forensic
7 scientific evidence that was not available at trial or that
8 contradicts forensic scientific evidence presented at trial.

18 G. Upon the filing of a motion under the provisions of this
19 act, the petitioner shall serve a copy of such motion upon the
20 attorney for the state. The state shall respond within sixty (60)
21 days of the receipt of service. The court shall hear the motion no
22 sooner than thirty (30) days and no later than ninety (90) days

2 evidence offered by the petitioner is not favorable to the
3 petitioner, the court shall dismiss the petition.

5 court shall hold a hearing to determine the appropriate relief to be
