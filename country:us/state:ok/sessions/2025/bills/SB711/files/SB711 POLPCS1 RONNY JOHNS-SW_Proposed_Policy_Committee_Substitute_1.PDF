13 shall use the four-year adjusted cohort graduation rate for
14 establishing the high school graduation rate for measuring alternate
15 year percentage growth targets as set forth in Section 3-151.2 of
16 this title beginning with the 2012-2013 school year.
17 C. The four-year adjusted cohort graduation rate shall be
18 defined as the number of students who graduate in four (4) years
