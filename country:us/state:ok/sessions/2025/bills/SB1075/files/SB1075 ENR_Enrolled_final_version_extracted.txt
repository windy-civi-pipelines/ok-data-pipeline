sign or have you sign any deed or any other document until your

find your own attorney. The law requires this contract to contain
the entire agreement. You should not rely upon any other written or
oral agreement or promise.”
F. Failure to include any of the required disclosures under
this section shall render the contract invalid and unenforceable by

maintained in this state with a federally insured financial
institution. The homeowner may terminate the contract at any time
if the wholesaler fails to comply with the provisions of this

Section 36:
section.
