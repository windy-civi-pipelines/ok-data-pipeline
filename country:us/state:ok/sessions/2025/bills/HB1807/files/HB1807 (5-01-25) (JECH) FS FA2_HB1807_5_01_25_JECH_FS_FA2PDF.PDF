1 A. The Oklahoma Water Resources Board shall require all permit
2 holders authorized to take and use groundwater to implement a system
3 of measuring groundwater usage from all wells associated with the
4 permit. The Board shall determine which measurement systems may be
5 utilized, which shall include, but not be limited to, pump and
6 irrigation monitoring telemetry devices capable of reporting usage.
7 Such measuring systems shall be in proper operating condition at all
8 times when groundwater is being produced. Data from the measuring
9 system shall be utilized for the annual groundwater use report.
10 B. To encourage groundwater conservation, beginning January 1,
11 2026, the Board shall provide a five-year flex allocation of
12 groundwater usage based upon the previously determined allocated
13 annual use of the basin or subbasin. A five-year flex allocation
14 shall not require a new permit for existing permit holders. A five-
15 year flex allocation shall be available for:
16 1. Existing permit holders for groundwater use permits in
17 basins or subbasins, based upon the maximum annual yield
18 determination at the time of the original application;
19 2. New applicants for groundwater use permits in basins or
20 subbasins based upon the current maximum annual yield determination;
21 and
22 3. New and existing applicants and temporary permit holders for
23 groundwater use permits in basins or subbasins where the maximum
24 annual yield has yet to be determined.

7 exceed the determined annual allocation in any year of the five-year
8 allocation; provided, that the applicant shall adhere to the
9 cumulative annually determined allocation of the basin or subbasin
10 over the five-year period. The permit holder shall not exceed the
11 permitted annual allocation by over two hundred percent (200%) in
