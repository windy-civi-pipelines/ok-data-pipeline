suspend sentencing of the defendant until the defendant has
presented proof to the court of enrollment in a program of treatment
for domestic abuse by an individual licensed practitioner or a
domestic abuse treatment program certified by the Attorney General
and attendance at weekly sessions of such program. Such proof shall

twenty (120) days after the defendant is ordered to such counseling
or treatment. At such time, the court may complete sentencing,
beginning the period of the sentence from the date that proof of
enrollment is presented to the court, and schedule reviews as
required by subparagraphs a and b of this paragraph and paragraphs 4
and 5 of this subsection. Three unexcused absences in succession or
seven unexcused absences in a period of fifty-two (52) weeks from
any court-ordered domestic abuse counseling or treatment program
shall be prima facie evidence of the violation of the conditions of
probation for the district attorney to seek acceleration or
revocation of any probation entered by the court.

other necessary services. The court may revoke all or any part of a
suspended sentence, deferred sentence, or probation pursuant to
Section 991b of Title 22 of the Oklahoma Statutes and subject the
defendant to any or all remaining portions of the original sentence;

defendant to appear in court. Thereafter, for any subsequent review
hearings, the court may accept a report on the progress of the
defendant from individual counseling, domestic abuse counseling, or
the treatment program. There shall be no requirement for the victim
to attend review hearings; and
7. If funding is available, a referee may be appointed and
assigned by the presiding judge of the district court to hear
designated cases set for review under this subsection. Reasonable
compensation for the referees shall be fixed by the presiding judge.
The referee shall meet the requirements and perform all duties in
the same manner and procedure as set forth in Sections 1-8-103 and
2-2-702 of Title 10A of the Oklahoma Statutes pertaining to referees
appointed in juvenile proceedings.
The defendant may be required to pay all or part of the cost of

Director shall have the authority and powers to proceed as specified
in the Administrative Procedures Act unless otherwise provided
herein. Provided, however, that provisions of this section for
written notice, enforcement hearing, and administrative orders shall

Elimination System Act or other applicable provisions of law.
B. The Oklahoma Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Act
shall not in any way impair or in any way affect a person's right to
recover damages for pollution in a court of competent jurisdiction.
Any person having any interest connected with the geographic area or
waters or water system affected, including but not limited to any

ENR. H. B. NO. 2104 Page 275

specify a time for compliance not to exceed thirty (30) days in the
case of a violation of an interim compliance schedule or operation
and maintenance requirement and not to exceed a reasonable time in
the case of a violation of a final deadline, taking into account the
seriousness of the violation and any good faith efforts to comply
with applicable requirements. Any order or notice issued by the
Executive Director may be served in any manner allowed by Oklahoma
Rules of Civil Procedures applicable to a civil summons.
E. Whenever on the basis of any information available the
Executive Director finds that any person regulated by the Department
has violated any of the provisions of the Oklahoma Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System Act, or any permit, rule, order or
condition or limitation implementing any of such sections, or

violation. In determining the amount of the civil penalty the court
shall consider the seriousness of the violation or violations, the
economic benefit, if any, resulting from the violation, any history
of such violations, any good faith efforts to comply with the
applicable requirements, the economic impact of the penalty on the
violator and such other matters as justice may require. For
purposes of this subsection, a single operational upset which leads
to simultaneous violations of more than one pollutant parameter
shall be treated as a single violation.
3. Any action pursuant to this subsection may be brought in the
district court for the district in which the property or defendant
is located or defendant resides or is doing business, and such court
shall have jurisdiction to restrain such violation and to require
compliance.

precedent to the filing of a civil action under the Oklahoma
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Act.

more than Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000.00) per day of violation,
or by imprisonment in the State Penitentiary for not more than two
(2) years as provided for in subsections B through F of Section 20P

shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a Class D1 felony offense and
shall be punished by a fine of not less than Five Thousand Dollars

imprisonment.
b. For the purpose of subparagraph a of this paragraph:
(1) in determining whether a defendant who is an
individual knew that his conduct placed another
person in imminent danger of death or serious
bodily injury, a person shall be responsible only
for actual awareness or actual belief that he
possessed, and knowledge possessed by a person
other than the defendant but not by the defendant
himself may not be attributed to the defendant;
provided however that in proving the defendant's
possession of actual knowledge, circumstantial
evidence may be used, including evidence that the
defendant took affirmative steps to shield
himself from relevant information,
(2) it is an affirmative defense to prosecution under
this subsection that the conduct charged was
consented to by the person endangered and that
ENR. H. B. NO. 2104 Page 279

the danger and conduct charged were reasonably
foreseeable hazards of an occupation, business,
profession or of a medical treatment or medical
or scientific experimentation conducted by
professionally approved methods and such other
person had been made aware of the risks involved
prior to giving consent, and such defense may be
established under this subparagraph by a
preponderance of the evidence.
4. Any person who knowingly makes any false material statement,
representation, or certification in any application, record, report,
plan, or other document filed or required to be maintained under the
Oklahoma Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Act or who knowingly
falsifies, tampers with, or renders inaccurate any monitoring device
or method required to be maintained under the Oklahoma Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System Act, shall, upon conviction, be guilty
of a Class D1 felony offense and shall be punished by a fine of not
more than Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000.00), or by imprisonment for

Dollars ($20,000.00) per day of violation, or by imprisonment for
not more than four (4) years as provided for in subsections B

parameter shall be treated as a single violation.
H. Whenever, on the basis of information available to him, the
Department finds that an owner or operator of any source is
introducing a pollutant into a treatment works in violation of the
Oklahoma Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Act or any
requirement, rule, permit or order issued under the Oklahoma
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Act, the Department shall
notify the owner or operator of such treatment works of such
violation. If the owner or operator of the treatment works does not
commence appropriate enforcement action within thirty (30) days of
the date of such notification, the Department may commence a civil
action for appropriate relief, including but not limited to a
permanent or temporary injunction, against the owner or operator of
ENR. H. B. NO. 2104 Page 280

such treatment works. In any such civil action the Department shall
join the owner or operator of such source as a party to the action.
Such action shall be brought in the district court in the county in
which the treatment works is located. Such court shall have
jurisdiction to restrain such violation and to require the owner or
operator of the treatment works and the owner or operator of the
source to take such action as may be necessary to come into
compliance with the Oklahoma Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
Act. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to limit or
prohibit any other authority the Department may have under this
section.
I. 1. Any person against whom an administrative compliance or
penalty order is issued under this section may obtain review of such
order by filing a petition for review in district court pursuant to
the Administrative Procedures Act. Such court shall not set aside
or remand such order unless there is not substantial evidence in the
administrative record, taken as a whole, to support the finding of a
violation or unless the assessment of the penalty constitutes an
abuse of discretion and shall not impose additional civil penalties
for the same violation unless the assessment of the penalty
constitutes an abuse of discretion. No stay of an administrative
penalty order shall be granted until the amount of penalty assessed
has been deposited with the reviewing district court pending
resolution of the petition for review.
2. If any person fails to pay an assessment of an
administrative penalty:
a. after the order making the assessment has become
final, or
b. after a court in an action brought under paragraph 1
of this subsection has entered a final judgment in
favor of the Department, as the case may be,
the Department may commence or may request the Attorney General to
bring a civil action in an appropriate district court to recover the
amount assessed plus interest at currently prevailing rates from the
date of the final order or the date of the final judgment, as the
case may be. In such an action, the validity, amount, and
appropriateness of such penalty shall not be subject to review.
3. Any person who fails to pay on a timely basis the amount of
an assessment of an administrative or civil penalty shall be
ENR. H. B. NO. 2104 Page 281

required to pay, in addition to such amount and interest, attorneys
fees and costs for collection proceeding and quarterly nonpayment
penalty for each quarter during which such failure to pay persists.
Such nonpayment penalty shall be in an amount equal to twenty
percent (20%) of the aggregate amount of such person's penalties and
nonpayment penalties which are unpaid as of the beginning of such
quarter.

expressly given and possessed or exercised under other laws, any of
the benefits, rights, powers or privileges which are herein
conferred on investment certificate issuers. Any company or person
who fails to obtain a written acknowledgment as described herein may
not engage in the business of issuing investment certificates.
D. Any officer, director or employee of an investment
certificate issuer found by the Administrator to be dishonest,
reckless, unfit to participate in the conduct of the affairs of the
institution, or practicing a continuing disregard or violation of
laws, rules, regulations or orders which are likely to cause
substantial loss to the company or likely to seriously weaken the
condition of the company shall be removed immediately from office by
the board of directors of the investment certificate issuer of which
he or she is an officer, director or employee, on the written order
of the Administrator; provided, that the investment certificate

soon as possible thereafter, the Commission will review the order of
the Administrator and make findings as it deems proper, and that,
pending said time, the officer, employee or director shall not

I. If the Administrator finds the capital of an investment
certificate issuer to be impaired according to the standard set
forth in subsection G of this section, the Administrator may:
1. Give notice of the impairment to the directors and
shareholders of the investment certificate issuer and levy an
assessment in a designated amount upon the holders of record of the
investment certificate issuer's stock to remedy an impairment of
capital. Upon receipt of an order to levy an assessment, the
directors shall cause to be sent to all holders of stock, at their
addresses as listed on the books of the investment certificate
issuer, a notice of the amount of the assessment and a copy of this
subsection. If an assessment is not paid within ninety (90) days
after the order is mailed, the Administrator, at his or her
discretion, may offer the shares of the defaulting stockholders for
sale at public auction at a price which shall not be less than the
amount of the assessment and the cost of the sale; or
2. Apply to the district court of any county where the assets
of the investment certificate issuer are located for an order
appointing a conservator of, and directing him to rehabilitate, the
investment certificate issuer. If all reasonable efforts to
rehabilitate the investment certificate issuer fail, the
Administrator may apply to the court for an order directing the
appointment of a liquidator to dissolve any such issuer and
liquidate its assets. All rights and interests of the stockholders
in the stock, property and assets of such investment certificate
issuer are thereby terminated except the rights of stockholders to
the proceeds of liquidation, if any, after all other valid claims,
including interest, against the assets of the investment certificate
issuer and the proceeds of liquidation have been satisfied. The
conservator or liquidator appointed under this subsection shall meet
qualifications established by the Administrator by rule adopted and
promulgated pursuant to the Administrative Procedures Act.
J. Whenever the capital or reserve of any investment
certificate issuer shall be impaired according to the standards set
forth in subsections G and H of this section, the investment
certificate issuer shall make no new loans, renew any investment
certificates or sell new investment certificates without the consent
of the Administrator.
K. 1. It shall be unlawful and shall be deemed a Class C2
felony offense for any investment certificate issuer to issue
investment certificates when insolvent.
ENR. H. B. NO. 2104 Page 305

2. Every officer, director, principal stockholder, or every
other person who materially participates or aids in the issuance of
an investment certificate in violation of this subsection, or who
directly or indirectly controls any such person, shall be jointly
and severally liable, unless the officer, director, principal
stockholder, or any other person who so participates, aids or
controls, sustains the burden of proof that the person did not know,
and could not have known, of the existence of the facts by reason of
which liability is alleged to exist. There shall be contribution as
in cases of contract among the persons so liable.
3. The rights and remedies provided for in this subsection are
in addition to any other rights or remedies provided for in Title 71
of the Oklahoma Statutes, or that may exist at law or in equity.
L. The Administrator may as often as he or she deems it prudent
and necessary for the protection of the public, make or cause to be
made examinations of the books, records, papers, assets and
liabilities of every kind and character owned by, or relating to,
every investment certificate issuer.
M. Every investment certificate issuer shall make and file with

by the Administrator, the resources and liabilities of the
investment certificate issuer at the close of business on the day to
be specified by the Administrator.

render the violator liable to the aggrieved consumer for the payment
of actual damages sustained by the customer and costs of litigation
including reasonable attorney's fees, and the aggrieved consumer
shall have a private right of action for damages, including but not
limited to, costs and attorney's fees. In any private action for
damages for a violation of the Consumer Protection Act the court
shall, subsequent to adjudication on the merits and upon motion of
the prevailing party, determine whether a claim or defense asserted
in the action by a nonprevailing party was asserted in bad faith,
was not well grounded in fact, or was unwarranted by existing law or
a good faith argument for the extension, modification, or reversal
of existing law. Upon so finding, the court shall enter a judgment
ordering such nonprevailing party to reimburse the prevailing party
an amount not to exceed Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000.00) for
reasonable costs, including attorney's fees, incurred with respect
to such claim or defense.
B. The commission of any act or practice declared to be a

the aggrieved customer for the payment of a civil penalty,
recoverable in an individual action only, in a sum set by the court
of not more than Two Thousand Dollars ($2,000.00) for each
violation. In determining whether an act or practice is
unconscionable the following circumstances shall be taken into
consideration by the court: (1) whether the violator knowingly or
with reason to know, took advantage of a consumer reasonably unable
ENR. H. B. NO. 2104 Page 370

to protect his or her interests because of his or her age, physical
infirmity, ignorance, illiteracy, inability to understand the
language of an agreement or similar factor; (2) whether, at the time
the consumer transaction was entered into, the violator knew or had
reason to know that price grossly exceeded the price at which
similar property or services were readily obtainable in similar
transactions by like consumers; (3) whether, at the time the
consumer transaction was entered into, the violator knew or had
reason to know that there was no reasonable probability of payment
of the obligation in full by the consumer; (4) whether the violator
knew or had reason to know that the transaction he or she induced
the consumer to enter into was excessively one-sided in favor of the
violator.
C. Any person who is found to be in violation of the Oklahoma
Consumer Protection Act in a civil action or who willfully violates
the terms of any injunction or court order issued pursuant to the
Consumer Protection Act shall forfeit and pay a civil penalty of not
more than Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000.00) per violation, in
addition to other penalties that may be imposed by the court, as the
court shall deem necessary and proper. For the purposes of this
section, the district court issuing an injunction shall retain
jurisdiction, and in such cases, the Attorney General, acting in the
name of the state, or a district attorney may petition for recovery
of civil penalties.
D. In administering and pursuing actions under this act, the
Attorney General and a district attorney are authorized to sue for

fees as determined by the court. Civil penalties or contempt
penalties sued for and recovered by the Attorney General or a
district attorney shall be used for the furtherance of their duties
and activities under the Consumer Protection Act.

proceeding of violating the Oklahoma Consumer Protection Act shall

an alleged item of child sexual abuse material shall contain:

after receiving the order, if practical;
ENR. H. B. NO. 2104 Page 401

3. The order shall specify that removal of any item covered by
the order shall be accomplished in a fashion that prevents or
minimizes the removal of, or restriction of access to, images,

for relief for cause from an order issued under subsection L of this

removing data, images or information that are not
subject to this section.

the original contractor provide to the claimant the name and last-
known address of an owner of the property. Failure of the original

shall contain the following information:
1. All of the information specified in subsection F of this
section;

used in the take-over offer in the form proposed to be published or
sent or delivered to offerees;
3. If the offeror is other than a natural person, the following
information shall be included:

Exchange Act of 1934, the form and content of the registration
statement shall include the same as the form and content of any such
statement and amendments required to be filed with the United States
Securities and Exchange Commission. If the statement and amendments
filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission
provide the information required to be disclosed by this act, the
filing of same with the Administrator shall satisfy the requirement
for the filing of a registration statement under this section. The
offeror must comply with all other requirements of this section.
C. Registration is not deemed approval by the Administrator and
any representation to the contrary is unlawful.

contain all of the information specified in subsection F of this
section or that the take-over offer materials provided to offerees
do not provide full disclosure to offerees of all material
information concerning the take-over offer. The suspension shall
remain in effect only until the determination following a hearing
held pursuant to subsection E of this section.
E. A hearing shall be scheduled by the Administrator with
respect to each suspension under this section and shall be held
within ten (10) calendar days of the date of the suspension. The
Oklahoma Administrative Procedures Act, Section 301 et seq. of Title
75 of the Oklahoma Statutes, and the administrative procedures of

made following the hearing shall be made within three (3) calendar
days after such hearing has been completed, but not more than
ENR. H. B. NO. 2104 Page 555

sixteen (16) calendar days after the date of the suspension. The
Administrator may prescribe different time limits than those
specified in this subsection by rule or order. If, based upon the

to conduct and receive results of national criminal history record
checks for authorized purposes pursuant to Public Law 92-544, the

Following receipt of the appropriate fee, the Bureau shall provide,

requesting authority to evaluate the criminal history record as such
record may apply to a specific purpose or intent. An individual may

or a certified copy of a gubernatorial pardon to the Oklahoma State
Bureau of Investigation, and upon verification of that record the
Bureau records shall reflect the dismissal of that charge.
C. The Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation may maintain an
identification file, including fingerprint impressions, on any
person under eighteen (18) years of age who is arrested or subject
to criminal or juvenile delinquency proceedings, provided all such
information shall be confidential and shall only be made available
to the Bureau and other law enforcement agencies. Whenever a
fingerprint impression or other identification information is
submitted to the Bureau on a person under eighteen (18) years of
age, the Bureau may retain and file such fingerprint and
identification information for identification purposes only. The
Bureau shall ensure that the information received and maintained for
identification purposes on persons under eighteen (18) years of age
shall be handled and processed with great care to keep such
information confidential from the general public. The Bureau may
receive and maintain the fingerprints and other identification
information on any person under eighteen (18) years of age believed
to be the subject of a runaway, missing, or abduction investigation,
for identification purposes at the request of a parent, guardian or
legal custodian of the person.

or opinion, the judge may, upon the motion of either party, order
the appearance of the medical professional creating such report or

good faith of any person making a report, providing medical records
or providing information pertaining to a workers' compensation or
insurance fraud investigation by the Attorney General, and
participating in a judicial proceeding resulting from a subpoena or
a report.

of this title and the excise tax on other tobacco products imposed
by Section 402 et seq. of this title.
ENR. H. B. NO. 2104 Page 686

B. 1. Members of noncompacting federally recognized Indian
tribes or nations may purchase cigarettes and other tobacco
products, without payment of Oklahoma cigarette excise tax or
Oklahoma other tobacco products excise tax, subject to the following
conditions:
a. the member of the noncompacting federally recognized
Indian tribe (hereinafter "purchaser") is purchasing
for his or her personal use, and not for sale,
transfer or other disposition to another person or
entity,
b. the purchaser is purchasing from a retailer licensed
by the federally recognized Indian tribe or nation of
which the purchaser is a member,
c. the licensed retailer of purchaser's federally
recognized Indian tribe or nation is located upon
"Indian country" of that licensing tribe or nation, as
that term is defined by 18 USC Section 1151(a) and
paragraph 3 of Section 348 of this title.
2. Members of noncompacting federally recognized tribes or
nations are not entitled to purchase cigarettes or other tobacco
products, free of Oklahoma excise tax, from retailers licensed by
any other tribe or nation, compacting or not, but have a right to
purchase cigarettes and other tobacco products, free of Oklahoma
excise tax, upon the "Indian country" of the tribe or nation of
which the purchaser is a member, per the United States Supreme Court
decision "Oklahoma Tax Commission v. Citizen Band Potawatomi Indian
Tribe of Oklahoma", 498 U.S. 505 (1991).
C. Cigarettes held for sale to members of a noncompacting tribe
or nation by licensed retailers of that tribe or nation, which are
located on the "Indian country" of that tribe or nation, as defined
by 18 USC Section 1151(a) and paragraph 3 of Section 348 of this
title, must bear a stamp issued by the Oklahoma Tax Commission
evidencing that cigarettes are purchased free of Oklahoma cigarette
excise tax. The following procedures shall apply to said stamps
(hereafter, "Native American tax free stamps"):
1. The probable demand for Native American tax free stamps for
each noncompacting tribe or nation shall be determined by the Tax
Commission by ascertaining the total membership in Oklahoma of the
tribe or nation from the Bureau of Indian Affairs or other reliable
ENR. H. B. NO. 2104 Page 687

source of public information regarding such membership, and
multiplying that number by the percentage of smokers in Oklahoma or
in the United States, whichever is greater, based on the most recent
data available from the State Department of Health and/or other
reliable source of public information. The product of that
calculation shall be multiplied by the average yearly consumption of
cigarettes by smokers in Oklahoma or the United States, whichever is
greater, based on the most recent data available from the State
Department of Health and/or other reliable source of public
information. The resulting number shall be deemed to constitute the
probable demand for Native American tax free stamps of such
noncompacting tribe or nation for a calendar year.
2. A preliminary determination of probable demand shall be
furnished to the governing authorities of each noncompacting tribe
or nation which may submit, for consideration by the Tax Commission,
any verifiable information in its possession regarding such probable
demand, including, but not limited to, a verifiable record of
previous sales to tribal members or other statistical evidence.
3. After consideration of all verifiable information furnished
by a noncompacting tribe or nation pursuant to paragraph 2 of this
subsection, the Tax Commission shall make its final determination of
probable demand, and furnish such determination to the subject
noncompacting tribe or nation and to all Oklahoma-licensed cigarette
wholesalers.
4. Each calendar year, the Tax Commission shall establish, as
to any and all Oklahoma-licensed cigarette wholesalers supplying
cigarettes to tribally licensed or owned retailers of each
noncompacting tribe or nation an allocation of the probable demand
for such tribe or nation, based upon each wholesaler's previous
year's reported sales of cigarettes to the tribally licensed or
owned retailers of such tribe or nation. In making such allocation,
the Tax Commission shall consider such other verifiable information
as may be submitted by a licensed wholesaler or such tribe or
nation. Upon reaching a final determination of allocation, the Tax
Commission shall advise the affected wholesaler and the tribe or
nation.
5. Oklahoma-licensed wholesalers may request and receive from
the Tax Commission, at the beginning of each quarter of the year,
their allocated share of Native American tax free stamps for the
tribally licensed or owned retailers of each noncompacting tribe or
nation. Once a wholesaler has received its allocated share of
ENR. H. B. NO. 2104 Page 688

Native American tax free stamps for the tribally licensed or owned
retailers of a noncompacting tribe or nation for the quarter, that
wholesaler may not receive any further Native American tax free
stamps for tribally licensed or owned retailers of that tribe or
nation during the quarter, absent good cause shown by verifiable
information submitted by the wholesaler and/or that tribe or nation,
which shall be considered and determined by the Tax Commission on a
case-by-case basis.
6. The Tax Commission is empowered and authorized to promulgate
such rules and regulations as, in its discretion, shall be deemed
necessary to implement and enforce the provisions of this section.
7. The sale of cigarettes bearing the Native American tax-free
stamp to a nonmember of the tribe or nation which licensed the
tribally owned or licensed retailer shall, in accordance with the
United States Supreme Court decision "Oklahoma Tax Commission v.
Citizen Band Potawatomi Indian Tribe of Oklahoma", 498 U.S. 505
(1991), obligate that tribal retailer for payment of the applicable
Oklahoma cigarette excise tax, together with the costs and attorney
fees associated with any civil action brought to collect the unpaid
Oklahoma cigarette excise tax. Such actions may be instituted in
the district court in and for the county in which the tribal
retailer is located.
D. The Oklahoma excise tax on all tobacco products other than
cigarettes (hereafter "other tobacco products") held for sale by
Oklahoma-licensed wholesalers shall be paid by the wholesaler and
stamps affixed thereto by the wholesaler pursuant to Section 403 of
this title, including those other tobacco products which may be
purchased by members of noncompacting tribes and nations on the
"Indian country" of such tribe or nation from a retailer licensed or
owned by such tribe or nation. The following procedures shall apply
to the tax-free sale of other tobacco products:
1. The probable demand for the tax-free consumption of other
tobacco products by members of each noncompacting tribe or nation
shall be determined by the Tax Commission by ascertaining the total
membership in Oklahoma of the tribe or nation from the Bureau of
Indian Affairs or other reliable source of public information
regarding such membership, and multiplying that number by the
percentage of users of such other tobacco products in Oklahoma or
the United States, whichever is greater, based on the most recent
data available from the State Department of Health and/or other
reliable source of public information. The product of that
ENR. H. B. NO. 2104 Page 689

calculation shall be multiplied by the average yearly consumption of
users of such other tobacco products in Oklahoma or the United
States, whichever is greater, based on the most recent data
available from the State Department of Health and/or other reliable
source of public information. The resulting number shall be deemed
to constitute the probable demand for the tax-free consumption of
other tobacco products by members of such noncompacting tribes or
nations for a calendar year.
2. A preliminary determination of probable demand shall be
furnished to the governing authorities of each noncompacting tribe
or nation, which may submit, for consideration by the Tax
Commission, any verifiable information in its possession regarding
such probable demand, including, but not limited to, a verifiable
record of previous sales to tribal members or other statistical
evidence.
3. After consideration of all verifiable information furnished
by a noncompacting tribe or nation pursuant to paragraph 2 of this
subsection, the Tax Commission shall make its final determination of
probable demand and furnish such determination to the subject
noncompacting tribe or nation and to all Oklahoma-licensed other
tobacco product wholesalers.
4. Each calendar year, the Tax Commission shall establish, as
to any and all Oklahoma-licensed other tobacco product wholesalers
supplying other tobacco products to the tribally licensed or owned
retailers of each noncompacting tribe or nation an allocation of the
probable demand for such tribe or nation, based upon each
wholesaler's previous year's reported sales of other tobacco
products to the tribally licensed or owned retailers of such tribe
or nation. In making such allocation, the Tax Commission shall
consider such other verifiable information as may be submitted by a
licensed wholesaler or such tribe or nation. Upon reaching a final
determination of allocation, the Tax Commission shall advise the
affected wholesaler and the tribe or nation.
5. Oklahoma-licensed wholesalers may request and receive from
the Tax Commission, on the 30th of each month, a refund and/or
credit for the previous month's tax-free sales of other tobacco
products, equal to the lesser of: one twelfth (1/12) of their
allocated share of tax-free sales of other tobacco products to the
tribally licensed or owned retailers of each noncompacting tribe or
nation or verifiable tax-free sales to the licensed or owned tribal
retailers of such tribe or nation. Once a wholesaler has received
ENR. H. B. NO. 2104 Page 690

such refund and/or credit for a previous month's tax-free sales to
the tribally licensed or owned retailers of each noncompacting tribe
or nation, that wholesaler may not receive any further refund and/or
credit for said previous month, absent good cause shown by
verifiable information submitted by the wholesaler and/or the
noncompacting tribe or nation, which shall be considered and
determined by the Tax Commission on a case-by-case basis.
6. The Tax Commission is empowered and authorized to promulgate
such rules and regulations as, in its discretion, shall be deemed
necessary to implement and enforce the provisions of this section.
7. The tax-free sale of other tobacco products to a nonmember
of the noncompacting tribe or nation which licenses the tribally
owned or licensed retailer shall, in accordance with the United
States Supreme Court decision "Oklahoma Tax Commission v. Citizen
Potawatomi Indian Tribe of Oklahoma", 498 U.S. 505 (1991), obligate
that tribal retailer for payment of the applicable Oklahoma other
tobacco product excise tax, together with the costs and attorney
fees associated with any civil action brought to collect the unpaid
Oklahoma other tobacco product excise tax. Such actions may be
instituted in the district court in and for the county in which the
tribal retailer is located.
E. The provisions of this section are intended to, and shall be
construed to apply only to, sales of cigarettes and other tobacco
products on the "Indian country" of noncompacting federally
recognized Indian tribes or nations to the members of such tribes or
nations. In the event that a noncompacting tribe or nation enters
into an agreement with the State of Oklahoma, pursuant to Section
346 of this title, the terms of such compact shall take precedence
over the provisions of this section, which shall have no application
to any tribe or nation, while any compact between the State of
Oklahoma and that tribe or nation is in force and effect.
F. All cigarettes which are sold or held for sale at tribally
owned or licensed stores shall have affixed thereto a stamp or
stamps evidencing payment or nonpayment of the Oklahoma cigarette
excise tax, as required by the provisions in this section.
G. It shall be unlawful for any person knowingly to ship,
transport, receive, possess, sell, distribute or purchase contraband
cigarettes. Any person who engages in shipping, transporting,
receiving, possessing, selling, distributing or purchasing
contraband cigarettes shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a
ENR. H. B. NO. 2104 Page 691

misdemeanor punishable by a fine of not more than One Thousand
Dollars ($1,000.00). Any person convicted of a second or subsequent
violation hereof shall be guilty of a Class D3 felony offense and
shall be punishable punished by a fine of not more than Five
Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00), by a term of imprisonment in the
custody of the Department of Corrections for not more than two (2)
years as provided for in subsections B through F of Section 20P of
Title 21 of the Oklahoma Statutes, or by both such fine and
imprisonment.
H. Any person who knowingly engages in shipping, transporting,
receiving, processing, selling, distributing or purchasing
contraband cigarettes shall be subject to the forfeiture of property
as is provided by Section 305 of this title and assessment of
penalty as provided thereby and assessment for any delinquent taxes
found to be owing.
I. Pursuant to 25 C.F.R., Section 140.17, no trader shall sell
tobacco, cigars or cigarettes to any Indian or other person under
eighteen (18) years of age.
SECTION 744. AMENDATORY 68 O.S. 2021, Section 426, is

SECTION 745. AMENDATORY 68 O.S. 2021, Section 1364, as
last amended by Section 1, Chapter 203, O.S.L. 2024 (68 O.S. Supp.
2024, Section 1364), is amended to read as follows:
Section 1364. Permits to do business.
A. Every person desiring to engage in a business within this
state who would be designated as a Group One or Group Three vendor,
pursuant to Section 1363 of this title, shall be required to secure
from the Oklahoma Tax Commission every three (3) years a written
permit for a fee of Twenty Dollars ($20.00) prior to engaging in
such business in this state. Each such person shall file with the
Tax Commission an application for a permit to engage in or transact
business in this state, setting forth such information as the Tax
Commission may require. The application shall be signed by the
owner of the business or representative of the business entity and
as a natural person, and, in the case of a corporation, as a legally
constituted officer thereof. To obtain a sales tax permit, an
individual or sole proprietor must be at least eighteen (18) years
of age. A parent or legal guardian may apply for a permit on behalf
of an individual or sole proprietor who is not at least eighteen
(18) years of age, provided the parent or legal guardian will be
considered the authorized user responsible for remitting state tax.
B. Upon receipt of an initial application, the Tax Commission
may issue a probationary permit effective for six (6) months which
will automatically renew for an additional thirty (30) months unless
the applicant receives written notification of the refusal of the
Commission to renew the permit. Within twenty (20) days of the date
of the written notification of the notice of refusal, the applicant
may request a hearing to show cause why the permit should be
renewed. Upon receipt of a request for a hearing, the Tax
Commission shall set the matter for hearing and give ten (10) days'
notice in writing of the time and place of the hearing. At the
hearing, the applicant shall set forth the qualifications of the
applicant for a permit and proof of compliance with all state tax
laws.
C. Holders of a probationary permit as provided in subsection B
of this section shall not be permitted to present the permit to
obtain a commercial license plate for their motor vehicle as
provided in Section 1133.1 of Title 47 of the Oklahoma Statutes.
ENR. H. B. NO. 2104 Page 693

D. Upon verification that the applicant is a Group Three
vendor, the Tax Commission may require such applicant to furnish a
surety bond or other security as the Commission may deem necessary
to secure payment of taxes under this article, prior to issuance of
a permit for the place of business set forth in the application for
permit. Provided, the Tax Commission is hereby authorized to set
guidelines, by adoption of regulations, for the issuance of sales
tax permits. Pursuant to the guidelines the Tax Commission may
refuse to issue permits to any Group Three vendors, or any class of
vendors included in the whole classification of Group Three vendors,
if the Tax Commission determines that it is likely this state will
lose tax revenue due to the difficulty of enforcing this article for
any reasons stated in paragraph 21 of Section 1354 of this title.
E. A separate permit for each additional place of business to
be operated must be obtained from the Tax Commission for a fee of
Ten Dollars ($10.00). Such permit shall be good for a period of
three (3) years. The Tax Commission shall grant and issue to each
applicant a separate permit for each place of business in this
state, upon proper application therefor and verification thereof by
the Tax Commission.
F. A permit is not assignable and shall be valid only for the
person in whose name it is issued and for the transaction of
business at the place designated therein. The permit shall at all
times be conspicuously displayed at the place of business for which
issued in a position where it can be easily seen. The permit shall
be in addition to all other permits required by the laws of this
state. Provided, if the location of the business is changed, such
person shall file with the Tax Commission an application for a
permit to engage in or transact business at the new location. Upon
issuance of the permit to the new location of such business, no
additional permit fee shall be due until the expiration of the
permit issued to the previous location of such business.
G. It shall be unlawful for any person coming within the class
designated as Group One or the class designated as Group Three to
engage in or transact a business of reselling tangible personal
property or services within this state unless a written permit or
permits shall have been issued to such person. Any person who
engages in a business subject to the provisions of this section
without a permit or permits, or after a permit has been suspended,
upon conviction, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by a
fine of not more than One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00). Any person
convicted of a second or subsequent violation hereof shall be guilty
ENR. H. B. NO. 2104 Page 694

of a Class D3 felony and offense punishable by a fine of not more
than Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00), or by a term of imprisonment
in the custody of the Department of Corrections for not more than
two (2) years as provided for in subsections B through F of Section
20P of Title 21 of the Oklahoma Statutes, or both such fine and
imprisonment.
H. Any person operating under a permit as provided in this
article shall, upon discontinuance of business by sale or otherwise,
return such permit to the Tax Commission for cancellation, together
with a remittance for any unpaid or accrued taxes. Failure to
surrender a permit and pay any and all accrued taxes will be
sufficient cause for the Tax Commission to refuse to issue a permit
subsequently to such person to engage in or transact any other
business in this state. In the case of a sale of any business, the
tax shall be deemed to be due on the sale of the fixtures and
equipment, and the Tax Commission shall not issue a permit to
continue or conduct the business to the purchaser until all tax
claims due this state have been settled.
I. All permits issued under the provisions of this article
shall expire three (3) years from the date of issuance at the close
of business at each place or location of the business within this
state. No refund of the fee shall be made if the business is
terminated prior to the expiration of the permit. Whenever the
sales tax reports required to be filed by Section 1365 of this title
indicate there is no business activity at a place of business for a
period of twelve (12) months, the Tax Commission, after giving
twenty (20) days' notice to the permit holder in writing of the time
and place of hearing to show cause why the sales tax permit for that
place of business should not be revoked, may revoke or suspend the
permit pursuant to an order of the Tax Commission after failure to
show cause or failure to appear by the permit holder.
J. Whenever a holder of a permit fails to comply with any
provisions of this article, the Tax Commission, after giving twenty
(20) days' notice in writing of the time and place of hearing to
show cause why the permit should not be revoked, may revoke or
suspend the permit pursuant to an order of the Tax Commission after
failure to show cause or failure to appear by the permit holder, the
permit to be renewed upon removal of cause or causes of revocation
or suspension. However, if a holder of a permit becomes delinquent
for a period of three (3) months or more in reporting or paying of
any tax due under this article, any duly authorized agent of the Tax
Commission may remove the permit from the taxpayer's premises and it
ENR. H. B. NO. 2104 Page 695

shall be returned or renewed only upon the filing of proper reports
and payment of all taxes due under this article.
K. Permits are not required of persons coming within the
classification designated as Group Two. The Oklahoma Tax Commission
shall issue a limited permit to Group Five vendors. The permit
shall be in such form as the Tax Commission may prescribe.
L. Nothing in this article shall be construed to allow a permit
holder to purchase, tax exempt, anything for resale that the permit
holder is not regularly in the business of reselling.
M. All monies received pursuant to issuance of such permits to
do business shall be paid to the State Treasurer and placed to the
credit of the General Revenue Fund of the State Treasury.
N. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 205 of this title,
the Oklahoma Tax Commission is authorized to release the following
information contained in the Master Sales and Use Tax File to
vendors:
1. Permit number;
2. Name in which permit is issued;
3. Name of business operation if different from ownership
(DBA);
4. Mailing address;
5. Business address;
6. Business class, North American Industry Classification
System (NAICS), or Standard Industrial Classification (SIC); and
7. Effective date and expiration or cancellation date of

Release of such information shall be limited to tax remitters
for the express purpose of determining the validity of sales permits
presented as evidence of purchasers' sales tax resale status under
this Oklahoma Tax Code.
The provisions of this subsection shall be strictly interpreted
and shall not be construed as permitting the disclosure of any other
ENR. H. B. NO. 2104 Page 696

information contained in the records and files of the Tax Commission
relating to sales tax or to any other taxes.
This information may be provided on a subscription basis, with
periodic updates, and sufficient fee charged, not to exceed One
Hundred Fifty Dollars ($150.00) per year, to offset the
administrative costs of providing the list. All revenue received by
the Oklahoma Tax Commission from such fees shall be deposited to the
credit of the Oklahoma Tax Commission Fund. No liability
whatsoever, civil or criminal, shall attach to any member of the Tax
Commission or any employee thereof for any error or omission in the
disclosure of information pursuant to this subsection.
O. If the Tax Commission enters into the Streamlined Sales and
Use Tax Agreement under Section 1354.18 of this title, the Tax
Commission is authorized to participate in its online sales and use
tax registration system and shall not require the payment of the
registration fees or other charges provided in this section from a
vendor who registers within the online system if the vendor has no
legal requirement to register.

interest, shall be maintained by the Commission as provided in this
act until each claim for benefits is paid, settled, or lapses under
this act, and costs of administration of such claims are paid.
D. Failure on the part of any employer to secure the payment of
compensation provided in this act shall have the effect of enabling
the Commission to assert the rights of an injured employee against
the employer.
E. Any employer that knowingly provides false information to
the Commission for purposes of securing or maintaining a self-
insurance permit shall be guilty of a Class D3 felony offense and
subject to a maximum fine of Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000.00).
