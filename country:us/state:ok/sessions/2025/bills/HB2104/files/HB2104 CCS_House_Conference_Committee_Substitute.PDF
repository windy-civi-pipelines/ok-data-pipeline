16 directly or indirectly controls any such person, shall be jointly
17 and severally liable, unless the officer, director, principal
18 stockholder, or any other person who so participates, aids or
19 controls, sustains the burden of proof that the person did not know,
20 and could not have known, of the existence of the facts by reason of
21 which liability is alleged to exist. There shall be contribution as
22 in cases of contract among the persons so liable.
23

15 each noncompacting tribe or nation shall be determined by the Tax
16 Commission by ascertaining the total membership in Oklahoma of the
17 tribe or nation from the Bureau of Indian Affairs or other reliable
18 source of public information regarding such membership, and
19 multiplying that number by the percentage of smokers in Oklahoma or
20 in the United States, whichever is greater, based on the most recent
21 data available from the State Department of Health and/or other
22 reliable source of public information. The product of that
23 calculation shall be multiplied by the average yearly consumption of
24 cigarettes by smokers in Oklahoma or the United States, whichever is
Req. No. 13818 Page 1070
1 grea ter, based on the most recent data available from the State
2 Department of Health and/or other reliable source of public
3 information. The resulting number shall be deemed to constitute the
4 probable demand for Native American tax free stamps of such
5 noncompacting tribe or nation for a calendar year.
6 2. A preliminary determination of probable demand shall be
7 furnished to the governing authorities of each noncompacting tribe
8 or nation which may submit, for consideration by the Tax Commission,
9 any verifiable information in its possession regarding such probable
10 demand, including, but not limited to, a verifiable record of
11 previous sales to tribal members or other statistical evidence.
12 3. After consideration of all verifiable information furnished
13 by a noncompacting tribe or nation pursuant to paragraph 2 of this
14 subsection, the Tax Commission shall make its final determination of
15 probable demand, and furnish such determination to the subject
16 noncompacting tribe or nation and to all Oklahoma-licensed cigarette
17 wholesalers.
18 4. Each calendar year, the Tax Commission shall establish, as
19 to any and all Oklahoma-licensed cigarette wholesalers supplying
20 cigarettes to tribally licensed or owned retailers of each
21 noncompacting tribe or nation an allocation of the probable demand
22 for such tribe or nation, based upon each wholesaler's previous
23 year's reported sales of cigarettes to the tribally licensed or
24 owned retailers of such tribe or nation. In making such allocation,
Req. No. 13818 Page 1071
1 the Tax Commission shall consider such other verifiable information

5 nation.
6 5. Oklahoma-licensed wholesalers may request and receive from
7 the Tax Commission, at the beginning of each quarter of the year,
8 their allocated share of Native American tax free stamps for the
9 tribally licensed or owned retailers of each noncompacting tribe or
10 nation. Once a wholesaler has received its allocated share of
11 Native American tax free stamps for the tribally licensed or owned
12 retailers of a noncompacting tribe or nation for the quarter, that
13 wholesaler may not receive any further Native American tax free
14 stamps for tribally licensed or owned retailers of that tribe or
15 nation during the quarter, absent good cause shown by verifiable
16 information submitted by the wholesaler and/or that tribe or nation,
17 which shall be considered and determined by the Tax Commission on a
18 case-by-case basis.
19 6. The Tax Commission is empowered and authorized to promulgate
20 such rules and regulations as, in its discretion, shall be deemed

4 Oklahoma cigarette excise tax, together with the costs and attorney
5 fees associated with any civil action brought to collect the unpaid
6 Oklahoma cigarette excise tax. Such actions may be instituted in
7 the district court in and for the county in which the tribal
8 retailer is located.
9 D. The Oklahoma excise tax on all tobacco products other than
10 cigarettes (hereafter "other tobacco products") held for sale by
11 Oklahoma-licensed wholesalers shall be paid by the wholesaler and

15 "Indian country" of such tribe or nation from a retailer licensed or
16 owned by such tribe or nation. The following procedures shall apply
17 to the tax-free sale of other tobacco products:
18 1. The probable demand for the tax-free consumption of other
19 tobacco products by members of each noncompacting tribe or nation
20 shall be determined by the Tax Commission by ascertaining the total
21 membership in Oklahoma of the tribe or nation from the Bureau of
22 Indian Affairs or other reliable source of public information
23 regarding such membership, and multiplying that number by the
24 percentage of users of such other tobacco products in Oklahoma or
Req. No. 13818 Page 1073
1 the United States, whichever is greater, based on the most recent
2 data available from the State Department of Health and/or other
3 reliable source of public information. The product of that
4 calculation shall be multiplied by the average yearly consumption of
5 users of such other tobacco products in Oklahoma or the United
6 States, whichever is greater, based on the most recent data
7 available from the State Department of Health and/or other reliable
8 source of public information. The resulting number shall be deemed
9 to constitute the probable demand for the tax-free consumption of
10 other tobacco products by members of such noncompacting tribes or
11 nations for a calendar year.
12 2. A preliminary determination of probable demand shall be
13 furnished to the governing authorities of each noncompacting tribe
14 or nation, which may submit, for consideration by the Tax
15 Commission, any verifiable information in its possession regarding
16 such probable demand, including, but not limited to, a verifiable
17 record of previous sales to tribal members or other statistical
18 evidence.
19 3. After consideration of all verifiable information furnished
20 by a noncompacting tribe or nation pursuant to paragraph 2 of this
21 subsection, the Tax Commission shall make its final determination of
22 probable demand and furnish such determination to the subject
23 noncompacting tribe or nation and to all Oklahoma-licensed other

5 probable demand for such tribe or nation, based upon each
6 wholesaler's previous year's reported sales of other tobacco
7 products to the tribally licensed or owned retailers of such tribe
8 or nation. In making such allocation, the Tax Commission shall
9 consider such other verifiable information as may be submitted by a
10 licensed wholesaler or such tribe or nation. Upon reaching a final
11 determination of allocation, the Tax Commission shall advise the
12 affected wholesaler and the tribe or nation.
13 5. Oklahoma-licensed wholesalers may request and receive from
14 the Tax Commission, on the 30th of each month, a refund and/or
15 credit for the previous month's tax-free sales of other tobacco

17 allocated share of tax-free sales of other tobacco products to the
18 tribally licensed or owned retailers of each noncompacting tribe or
19 nation or verifiable tax-free sales to the licensed or owned tribal
20 retailers of such tribe or nation. Once a wholesaler has received
21 such refund and/or credit for a previous month's tax-free sales to
22 the tribally licensed or owned retailers of each noncompacting tribe
23 or nation, that wholesaler may not receive any further refund and/or
24 credit for said previous month, absent good cause shown by
Req. No. 13818 Page 1075

24 346 of this title, the terms of such compact shall take precedence
Req. No. 13818 Page 1076

16 consumer transaction was entered into, the violator knew or had
17 reason to know that there was no reasonable probability of payment
18 of the obligation in full by the consumer; (4) whether the violator
19 knew or had reason to know that the transaction he or she induced

6 wholesaler's previous year's reported sales of other tobacco
7 products to the tribally licensed or owned retailers of such tribe

14 the Tax Commission, on the 30th of each month, a refund and/or
