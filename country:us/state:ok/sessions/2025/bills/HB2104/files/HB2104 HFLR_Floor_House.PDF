2 data available from the State Department of Health and/or other
3 reliable source of public information. The product of that
4 calculation shall be multiplied by the average yearly consumption of
5 users of such other tobacco products in Oklahoma or the United
6 States, whichever is greater, based on the most recent data
7 available from the State Department of Health and/or other reliable
8 source of public information. The resulting number shall be deemed
9 to constitute the probable demand for the tax-free consumption of
10 other tobacco products by members of such noncompacting tribes or
11 nations for a calendar year.
12 2. A preliminary determination of probable demand shall be
13 furnished to the governing authorities of each noncompacting tribe
14 or nation, which may submit, for consideration by the Tax
15 Commission, any verifiable information in its possession regarding
16 such probable demand, including, but not limited to, a verifiable
17 record of previous sales to tribal members or other statistical

23 noncompacting tribe or nation and to all Oklahoma-licensed other
24 tobacco product wholesalers.

5 probable demand for such tribe or nation, based upon each
6 wholesaler's previous year's reported sales of other tobacco
7 products to the tribally licensed or owned retailers of such tribe
8 or nation. In making such allocation, the Tax Commission shall
9 consider such other verifiable information as may be submitted by a
10 licensed wholesaler or such tribe or nation. Upon reaching a final
11 determination of allocation, the Tax Commission shall advise the
12 affected wholesaler and the tribe or nation.
13 5. Oklahoma-licensed wholesalers may request and receive from
14 the Tax Commission, on the 30th of each month, a refund and/or
15 credit for the previous month's tax-free sales of other tobacco

17 allocated share of tax-free sales of other tobacco products to the
18 tribally licensed or owned retailers of each noncompacting tribe or
19 nation or verifiable tax-free sales to the licensed or owned tribal
20 retailers of such tribe or nation. Once a wholesaler has received
21 such refund and/or credit for a previous month's tax-free sales to
22 the tribally licensed or owned retailers of each noncompacting tribe
23 or nation, that wholesaler may not receive any further refund and/or
24 credit for said previous month, absent good cause shown by

13 tobacco product excise tax, together with the costs and attorney

15 each noncompacting tribe or nation shall be determined by the Tax
16 Commission by ascertaining the total membership in Oklahoma of the
17 tribe or nation from the Bureau of Indian Affairs or other reliable
18 source of public information regarding such membership, and

20 in the United States, whichever is greater, based on the most recent

22 reliable source of public information. The product of that
23 calculation shall be multiplied by the average yearly consumption of

6 2. A preliminary determination of probable demand shall be
7 furnished to the governing authorities of each noncompacting tribe
8 or nation which may submit, for consideration by the Tax Commission,
9 any verifiable information in its possession regarding such probable
10 demand, including, but not limited to, a verifiable record of
11 previous sales to tribal members or other statistical evidence.
12 3. After consideration of all verifiable information furnished
13 by a noncompacting tribe or nation pursuant to paragraph 2 of this
14 subsection, the Tax Commission shall make its final determination of
15 probable demand, and furnish such determination to the subject
16 noncompacting tribe or nation and to all Oklahoma-licensed cigarette
17 wholesalers.
18 4. Each calendar year, the Tax Commission shall establish, as
19 to any and all Oklahoma-licensed cigarette wholesalers supplying
20 cigarettes to tribally licensed or owned retailers of each
21 noncompacting tribe or nation an allocation of the probable demand
22 for such tribe or nation, based upon each wholesaler's previous
23 year's reported sales of cigarettes to the tribally licensed or
24 owned retailers of such tribe or nation. In making such allocation,
HB2104 HFLR Page 1072
BOLD FACE denotes Committee Amendments.

7 the Tax Commission, at the beginning of each quarter of the year,
8 their allocated share of Native American tax free stamps for the

10 nation. Once a wholesaler has received its allocated share of
11 Native American tax free stamps for the tribally licensed or owned
12 retailers of a noncompacting tribe or nation for the quarter, that
13 wholesaler may not receive any further Native American tax free
14 stamps for tribally licensed or owned retailers of that tribe or
15 nation during the quarter, absent good cause shown by verifiable
16 information submitted by the wholesaler and/or that tribe or nation,
17 which shall be considered and determined by the Tax Commission on a
18 case-by-case basis.
19 6. The Tax Commission is empowered and authorized to promulgate
20 such rules and regulations as, in its discretion, shall be deemed

6 States, whichever is greater, based on the most recent data
7 available from the State Department of Health and/or other reliable
8 source of public information. The resulting number shall be deemed

13 furnished to the governing authorities of each noncompacting tribe
14 or nation, which may submit, for consideration by the Tax
15 Commission, any verifiable information in its possession regarding
16 such probable demand, including, but not limited to, a verifiable

5 probable demand for such tribe or nation, based upon each
6 wholesaler's previous year's reported sales of other tobacco
7 products to the tribally licensed or owned retailers of such tribe
8 or nation. In making such allocation, the Tax Commission shall
9 consider such other verifiable information as may be submitted by a
10 licensed wholesaler or such tribe or nation. Upon reaching a final
11 determination of allocation, the Tax Commission shall advise the
12 affected wholesaler and the tribe or nation.
13 5. Oklahoma-licensed wholesalers may request and receive from
14 the Tax Commission, on the 30th of each month, a refund and/or

17 allocated share of tax-free sales of other tobacco products to the
18 tribally licensed or owned retailers of each noncompacting tribe or
19 nation or verifiable tax-free sales to the licensed or owned tribal
20 retailers of such tribe or nation. Once a wholesaler has received
21 such refund and/or credit for a previous month's tax-free sales to
22 the tribally licensed or owned retailers of each noncompacting tribe
