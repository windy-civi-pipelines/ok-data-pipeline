Section 7:
2. In all other instances, proceedings for review shall be

party where the property interest affected is situated, naming as
respondents only the agency, such other party or parties in the
administrative proceeding as may be named by the petitioner or as
otherwise may be allowed by law, within thirty (30) days after the
appellant is notified of the final agency order as provided in

Section 8:
Section 312 of this title.

Constitution, except after a trial by jury before such court.
B. The provisions of subsection A of this section shall not
apply to a summary judgment rendered in compliance with Title 12 of
the Oklahoma Statutes and any precedents establishing the standards
for summary judgment. Such requirement shall not apply to a civil
case in a court proceeding in equity jurisdiction that, prior to the
passage of this act, did not involve a right to a trial by jury
before a court established under the Oklahoma Constitution.
