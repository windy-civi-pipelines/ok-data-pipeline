15 SECTION 1. NEW LAW A new section of law not to be
16 codified in the Oklahoma Statutes reads as follows:
17 The Legislature finds that:
18 1. Antisemitism, including harassment on the basis of actual or
19 perceived Jewish origin, ancestry, ethnicity, identity, affiliation,
20 or faith, remains a persistent, pervasive, and disturbing problem in
21 contemporary American society;
22 2. Jewish people continue to be a targeted minority in the
23 United States. Data shows, for instance, that Jews are consistently
24 the most likely of all religious groups to be victimized by
Req. No. 12869 Page 1
1 inci dents of hate, and that such incidents are increasing at an
2 alarming rate;
3 3. State officials and institutions have a responsibility to
4 protect citizens from acts of hate and bigotry motivated by
5 discriminatory animus, including antisemitism, and must be given the
6 tools to do so;
7 4. Valid monitoring, informed analysis and investigation, and
8 effective policy-making all require uniform definitions;
9 5. While there can be no exhaustive definition of antisemitism,
10 as it can take many forms, the International Holocaust Remembrance
11 Alliance (IHRA) Working Definition has been an essential
12 definitional tool used to determine contemporary manifestations of
13 antisemitism, and includes useful examples of discriminatory anti-
14 Israel acts that cross the line into antisemitism;
15 6. The IHRA definition is used by various agencies of the
16 federal government, the majority of the United States, and the 33
17 governments that are members of IHRA; recommended for use by the
18 European Council and the European Parliament, endorsed by the UN
19 Secretary General and the Secretary General of the OAS, included in
20 policy guides prepared by the Organization for Security and
21 Cooperation in Europe, and formally adopted by a growing number of
22 European nations; and
23 7. Use of this definition of antisemitism, although it is not
24 to be taken as an exhaustive definition, will increase the awareness

1 and understanding of the parameters of contemporary anti-Jewish
2 discrimination in certain circumscribed areas.
3 SECTION 2. NEW LAW A new section of law to be codified in
4 the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 61 of Title 25, unless there is
5 created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:
6 A. For purposes of this act, the term "antisemitism" has the
7 same meaning as provided for in the working definition of
8 antisemitism adopted by the International Holocaust Remembrance
9 Alliance (IHRA) on May 26, 2016, including the "contemporary
10 examples of antisemitism."
11 B. Nothing in this act shall be construed to diminish or
12 infringe upon any right protected under the First Amendment to the
13 United States Constitution, or the Oklahoma Constitution. Nothing
14 in this act shall be construed to conflict with local, federal or
15 state discrimination laws.
16 C. In reviewing, investigating, or deciding whether there has
17 been a violation of any policy, law, or regulation prohibiting
18 discriminatory acts in any section of the Oklahoma Statutes,
19 including, but limited to, Sections 1101 through 1707 of Title 25 of
20 the Oklahoma Statutes or Section 850 of Title 21 of the Oklahoma
21 Statutes all state departments and agencies shall take into
22 consideration the definition of antisemitism set forth in subsection
23 A of this section or purposes of determining whether the alleged act
24 was motivated by discriminatory antisemitic intent, including
Req. No. 12869 Page 3
1 inte ntionally selecting any victim or group of victims or any
2 property as the object of the offense because of such victim's or
3 group of victims' actual or perceived race, color, religion, or
4 national origin.
5 D. Nothing in this act shall be construed to alter the
6 evidentiary requirements pursuant to which an agency or department
7 makes a determination that conduct, including harassment, amounts to
8 actionable discrimination, or to diminish or infringe upon the
9 rights protected under any other provision of law.
