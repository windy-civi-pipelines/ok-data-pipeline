9 2. With the care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the

11 like capacity and familiar with such matters would use in the
12 conduct of an enterprise of a like character and with like aims;
13 3. By diversifying the investments of the plan so as to
14 minimize the risk of large losses, unless under the circumstances it

8 unless such firm or service provider has a practice of, and in
9 writing commits to, following proxy voting guidelines that are
10 consistent with the plan's fiduciary obligation to act based only on
11 pecuniary factors.
12 C. Unless no economically practicable alternative is available,
13 plan assets shall not be entrusted to a fiduciary unless that
14 fiduciary has a practice of, and in writing commits to, following
15 guidelines, when engaging with portfolio companies and vote shares
16 or proxies that match the plan's obligation to act based only on
17 pecuniary factors.
18 D. With respect to the pension benefit plans, all such proxy
19 voting authority shall reside with the respective Board of Trustees,
20 except that the Board of Trustees may delegate such authority to a

17 authorized to:
18 1. Require such person to file on such forms as he or she
19 prescribes a statement or report in writing, under oath, as to all
20 the facts and circumstances concerning the violation, and such other
21 data and information as he or she may deem necessary;

Req. No. 12765 Page 8
