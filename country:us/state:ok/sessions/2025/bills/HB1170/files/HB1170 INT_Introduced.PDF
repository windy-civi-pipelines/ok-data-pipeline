9 minimize the risk of large losses, unless under the circumstances it

15 SECTION 4. NEW LAW A new section of law to be codified
16 in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 9104 of Title 62, unless there
17 is created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:
18 A fiduciary's evaluation of an investment, or evaluation or
19 exercise of any right appurtenant to an investment, must take into
20 account only pecuniary factors. Plan fiduciaries are not permitted
21 to promote nonpecuniary benefits or any other nonpecuniary goals.
22 Environmental, social, ideological, corporate governance, or other
23 goals, objectives, or similarly oriented considerations are
24 pecuniary factors only if they present economic risks or
Req. No. 10216 Page 5

1 oppo rtunities that qualified investment professionals would treat as
2 material economic considerations under generally accepted investment
3 theories. The weight given to those factors should solely reflect a
4 prudent assessment of their impact on risk and return. Fiduciaries
5 considering environmental, social, corporate governance, or other
6 similarly oriented factors as pecuniary factors are also required to
7 examine the level of diversification, degree of liquidity, and the
8 potential risk-return in comparison with other available alternative
9 investments that would play a similar role in their plans'
10 portfolios. Any pecuniary consideration of environmental, social,
11 or governance factors must necessarily include evaluating whether
12 greater returns can be achieved through investments that rank poorly
13 on such factors.

15 in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 9105 of Title 62, unless there
16 is created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:
17 A. All proxies held by or on behalf of a pension benefit plan
18 or the beneficiaries thereof shall be voted solely in the pecuniary
19 interest of plan participants. Voting to further nonpecuniary,
20 environmental, social, political, ideological or other benefits or
21 goals is prohibited.
22 B. Unless no economically practicable alternative is available,
23 a fiduciary may not adopt a practice of following the
24 recommendations of a proxy advisory firm or other service provider
Req. No. 10216 Page 6

1 unle ss such firm or service provider has a practice of, and in
2 writing commits to, following proxy voting guidelines that are
3 consistent with the plan's fiduciary obligation to act based only on
4 pecuniary factors.
5 C. Unless no economically practicable alternative is available,
6 plan assets shall not be entrusted to a fiduciary unless that
7 fiduciary has a practice of, and in writing commits to, following
8 guidelines, when engaging with portfolio companies and vote shares
9 or proxies that match the plan's obligation to act based only on
10 pecuniary factors.
11 D. With respect to the pension benefit plans, all such proxy
12 voting authority shall reside with the respective Board of Trustees,
13 except that the Board of Trustees may delegate such authority to a
14 person who has a practice of, and in writing commits to, following
15 guidelines that match the plan's obligation to act based only on
16 pecuniary factors.
17 E. All proxy votes shall be tabulated and reported annually to
18 the respective Board of Trustees. For each vote, the report shall
19 contain a vote caption, the plan's vote, the recommendation of

22 available webpage.
