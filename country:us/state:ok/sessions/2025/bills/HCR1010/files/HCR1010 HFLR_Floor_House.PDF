15 WHEREAS, everyone in Oklahoma and much of the world knows about
16 the horrific events that transpired in Oklahoma City on the morning
17 of April 19, 1995, when a terrorist blast ripped apart the Alfred P.
18 Murrah Federal Building at 9:02 a.m., claiming the lives of 168
19 individuals and leaving many others wounded both physically and
20 mentally; and
21 WHEREAS, we take this opportunity to remember those who died or
22 were wounded. May their lives never be said to have been in vain.
23 They live on in our memories, and their actions while alive

1 infl uence and inform us to this day of how to live in charity toward
2 others and to do good and not repay evil with evil; and
3 WHEREAS, we acknowledge the debt of gratitude owed to the many
4 first responders – including local, state, and federal law
5 enforcement personnel, firefighters, search and rescue teams, public
6 and private medical personnel, other emergency services personnel,
7 and thousands of volunteers from the community – who immediately
8 answered the call of helping to rescue the living and recover the
9 dead. They saved lives, assisted the injured and wounded, comforted
10 the bereaved, provided meals and support to those who came to
11 Oklahoma City to offer assistance, and so much more; and
12 WHEREAS, we now renounce these despicable acts of terrorism and
13 ask Almighty God to root out the seeds of such terrorism that grow
14 in the hearts of men and women worldwide, festering into acts of
15 destruction and violence. We ask for an uncovering of such plots
16 before they can claim further lives. We ask for divine justice
17 tempered with divine mercy; and
18 WHEREAS; we repent on behalf of those who harbor such anger,
19 bitterness and hatred toward others. We ask for love to take root
20 in place of such darkness; we willingly forgive those who have hurt
21 us, and when we can't find it in our own hearts to forgive, we ask
22 for divine help; and
23 WHEREAS, we vow to teach our children and all future
24 generations that love toward their creator, toward themselves, and

1 towa rd others is the only solution. We remember this day because we
2 choose a different future moving forward. We see what violence and
3 hatred brings, and we declare we will not pick up the same offense
4 but will instead plant seeds of love and hope in its place. May we
5 rebuild and replant only from this foundation; and
6 WHEREAS, we decree the Oklahoma City National Memorial will not
7 just be a place to mourn the dead and to pity the lives lost. We
8 mourn with those who mourn and extend and receive comfort. But we
9 decree this will be a place to restart hope for a better and more
10 peaceful future. It will not be a place of rekindling anger toward
11 terrorists, which gives the darkness power. It will instead be a
12 place where light dispels darkness; love dispels fear; hope dispels
13 despair; and
14 WHEREAS, we resolve that while we will not be cowed by
15 terrorists, we will not respond in a like spirit; and
16 WHEREAS, we commemorate this day in advance of the 30th
17 anniversary of the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building
18 in Oklahoma City. We do so not in vain, thinking nothing has truly
19 changed in the hearts of men and women in the last 30 years,
20 believing that we are more divided now than perhaps any time in
21 history. We do so instead with the hope that, with divine help, we
22 can begin to truly love our brothers and sisters and move past the
23 hatred that so easily divides us. We bless those who persecute us
24 and despitefully use us, not because we don't desire justice, but

1 beca use we know divine justice exceeds our own, just as divine mercy
2 is given to those who seek mercy.

15 the days and weeks thereafter.
