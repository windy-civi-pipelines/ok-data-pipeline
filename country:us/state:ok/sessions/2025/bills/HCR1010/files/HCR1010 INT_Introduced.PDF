9 A Concurrent Resolution remembering those killed or

11 reclaiming hope for the future; and directing
distribution.

14 WHEREAS, everyone in Oklahoma and much of the world knows about
15 the horrific events that transpired in Oklahoma City on the morning
16 of April 19, 1995, when a terrorist blast ripped apart the Alfred P.
17 Murrah Federal Building at 9:02 a.m., claiming the lives of 168
18 individuals and leaving many others wounded both physically and
19 mentally; and
20 WHEREAS, we take this opportunity to remember those who died or
21 were wounded. May their lives never be said to have been in vain.
22 They live on in our memories, and their actions while alive
23 influence and inform us to this day of how to live in charity toward
24 others and to do good and not repay evil with evil; and

1 WHEREAS, we acknowledge the debt of gratitude owed to the many
2 first responders – including local, state, and federal law
3 enforcement personnel, firefighters, search and rescue teams, public
4 and private medical personnel, other emergency services personnel,
5 and thousands of volunteers from the community – who immediately
6 answered the call of helping to rescue the living and recover the
7 dead. They saved lives, assisted the injured and wounded, comforted
8 the bereaved, provided meals and support to those who came to
9 Oklahoma City to offer assistance, and so much more; and
10 WHEREAS, we now renounce these despicable acts of terrorism and
11 ask Almighty God to root out the seeds of such terrorism that grow
12 in the hearts of men and women worldwide, festering into acts of
13 destruction and violence. We ask for an uncovering of such plots
14 before they can claim further lives. We ask for divine justice
15 tempered with divine mercy; and
16 WHEREAS; we repent on behalf of those who harbor such anger,
17 bitterness and hatred toward others. We ask for love to take root
18 in place of such darkness; we willingly forgive those who have hurt
19 us, and when we can't find it in our own hearts to forgive, we ask
20 for divine help; and
21 WHEREAS, we vow to teach our children and all future
22 generations that love toward their creator, toward themselves, and
23 toward others is the only solution. We remember this day because we
24 choose a different future moving forward. We see what violence and

1 hatr ed brings, and we declare we will not pick up the same offense
2 but will instead plant seeds of love and hope in its place. May we
3 rebuild and replant only from this foundation; and
4 WHEREAS, we decree the Oklahoma City National Memorial will not
5 just be a place to mourn the dead and to pity the lives lost. We
6 mourn with those who mourn and extend and receive comfort. But we
7 decree this will be a place to restart hope for a better and more
8 peaceful future. It will not be a place of rekindling anger toward
9 terrorists, which gives the darkness power. It will instead be a
10 place where light dispels darkness; love dispels fear; hope dispels
11 despair; and
12 WHEREAS, we resolve that while we will not be cowed by
13 terrorists, we will not respond in a like spirit; and
14 WHEREAS, we commemorate this day in advance of the 30th
15 anniversary of the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building
16 in Oklahoma City. We do so not in vain, thinking nothing has truly
17 changed in the hearts of men and women in the last 30 years,
18 believing that we are more divided now than perhaps any time in
19 history. We do so instead with the hope that, with divine help, we
20 can begin to truly love our brothers and sisters and move past the
21 hatred that so easily divides us. We bless those who persecute us
22 and despitefully use us, not because we don't desire justice, but
23 because we know divine justice exceeds our own, just as divine mercy
24 is given to those who seek mercy.

1 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
2 OF THE 1ST SESSION OF THE 60TH OKLAHOMA LEGISLATURE, THE SENATE
3 CONCURRING THEREIN:
4 THAT the Oklahoma Legislature sends its heartfelt
5 remembrances to the families, friends, and neighbors of the 168
6 people killed in the terrorist bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah
7 Federal Building in Oklahoma City.
8 THAT the Oklahoma Legislature sends its heartfelt
9 remembrances to those injured in the bombing and expresses gratitude
10 to the thousands of first responders, rescue workers, medical
11 personnel, and volunteers from the community and across the nation
12 who answered the call for help on the morning of the attack and in
13 the days and weeks thereafter.
14 THAT a copy of this resolution be sent to Kari Watkins,
15 Executive Director of the Oklahoma City National Memorial and
16 Museum.
