injured in the terrorist bombing of the Alfred P.
Murrah Federal Building; thanking those who helped in
the recovery; renouncing all such terroristic acts;
reclaiming hope for the future; and directing
distribution.
WHEREAS, everyone in Oklahoma and much of the world knows about
the horrific events that transpired in Oklahoma City on the morning
of April 19, 1995, when a terrorist blast ripped apart the Alfred P.
Murrah Federal Building at 9:02 a.m., claiming the lives of 168
individuals and leaving many others wounded both physically and
mentally; and
WHEREAS, we take this opportunity to remember those who died or
were wounded. May their lives never be said to have been in vain.
They live on in our memories, and their actions while alive
influence and inform us to this day of how to live in charity toward
others and to do good and not repay evil with evil; and
WHEREAS, we acknowledge the debt of gratitude owed to the many
first responders – including local, state, and federal law
enforcement personnel, firefighters, search and rescue teams, public
and private medical personnel, other emergency services personnel,
and thousands of volunteers from the community – who immediately
answered the call of helping to rescue the living and recover the
dead. They saved lives, assisted the injured and wounded, comforted
the bereaved, provided meals and support to those who came to
Oklahoma City to offer assistance, and so much more; and
WHEREAS, we now renounce these despicable acts of terrorism and
ask Almighty God to root out the seeds of such terrorism that grow
in the hearts of men and women worldwide, festering into acts of
destruction and violence. We ask for an uncovering of such plots
before they can claim further lives. We ask for divine justice
tempered with divine mercy; and
WHEREAS, we repent on behalf of those who harbor such anger,
bitterness and hatred toward others. We ask for love to take root
in place of such darkness; we willingly forgive those who have hurt
us, and when we can't find it in our own hearts to forgive, we ask
for divine help; and
ENR. H. C. R. NO. 1010 Page 2
WHEREAS, we vow to teach our children and all future
generations that love toward their creator, toward themselves, and
toward others is the only solution. We remember this day because we
choose a different future moving forward. We see what violence and
hatred brings, and we declare we will not pick up the same offense
but will instead plant seeds of love and hope in its place. May we
rebuild and replant only from this foundation; and
WHEREAS, we decree the Oklahoma City National Memorial will not
just be a place to mourn the dead and to pity the lives lost. We
mourn with those who mourn and extend and receive comfort. But we
decree this will be a place to restart hope for a better and more
peaceful future. It will not be a place of rekindling anger toward
terrorists, which gives the darkness power. It will instead be a
place where light dispels darkness; love dispels fear; hope dispels
despair; and
WHEREAS, we resolve that while we will not be cowed by
terrorists, we will not respond in a like spirit; and
WHEREAS, we commemorate this day in advance of the 30th
anniversary of the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building
in Oklahoma City. We do so not in vain, thinking nothing has truly
changed in the hearts of men and women in the last 30 years,
believing that we are more divided now than perhaps any time in
history. We do so instead with the hope that, with divine help, we
can begin to truly love our brothers and sisters and move past the
hatred that so easily divides us. We bless those who persecute us
and despitefully use us, not because we don't desire justice, but
because we know divine justice exceeds our own, just as divine mercy
is given to those who seek mercy.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
OF THE 1ST SESSION OF THE 60TH OKLAHOMA LEGISLATURE, THE SENATE
CONCURRING THEREIN:
THAT the Oklahoma Legislature sends its heartfelt remembrances
to the families, friends, and neighbors of the 168 people killed in
the terrorist bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in
Oklahoma City.
THAT the Oklahoma Legislature sends its heartfelt remembrances
to those injured in the bombing and expresses gratitude to the
thousands of first responders, rescue workers, medical personnel,
ENR. H. C. R. NO. 1010 Page 3

the call for help on the morning of the attack and in the days and
