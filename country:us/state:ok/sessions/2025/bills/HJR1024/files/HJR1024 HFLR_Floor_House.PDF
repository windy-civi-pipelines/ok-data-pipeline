6 THE GIST OF THE PROPOSITION IS AS FOLLOWS:
7 This measure amends Section 3 of Article 7-B of the Oklahoma
8 Constitution. It changes provisions related to the Judicial
9 Nominating Commission. It updates references so appointments
10 made by certain persons based on the congressional districts
11 would be made using the current congressional districts instead
12 of the districts as the districts were constituted when this
13 section of the Constitution was originally adopted in 1967. It
14 removes a prohibition on certain members of the Commission so
15 that the person could be a licensed attorney. It allows a
16 person to serve on the Commission even if they have a member of
17 their family who is a licensed attorney. It changes the terms
18 so that with the exception of at-large members, the term would
19 be for six (6) years. The at-large members would serve a two-
20 year term. It removes restrictions based on political party
21 membership. It removes a provision that prohibits a Commission
22 member from succeeding himself or herself on the Commission. It
23 provides that the changes in the way people are appointed or
24 selected for membership on the Judicial Nominating Commission
