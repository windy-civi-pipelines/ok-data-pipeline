reserves to the states and the people all powers not delegated to

3
the federal government;
3
4
2. The federal executive branch has expanded far beyond its
4
5
constitutional boundaries, with numerous agencies assuming powers
5
6
and responsibilities not granted by the United States Constitution;
6
7
3. This expansion has infringed on the rights of states and
7
8
their citizens, undermining federalism and Oklahoma’s sovereignty;
8
9
4. The United States Constitution guarantees inalienable
9
10
rights, including those enumerated in the First, Second, and Fourth

11
Amendments, as well as protections of individual autonomy in matters
11

unethical, or unconstitutional actions and must be protected from

15
16
6. Any actions by federal agents or entities that infringe upon
16
17
these rights or exceed the federal government’s enumerated powers
17
18
are unconstitutional and an affront to the liberty of Oklahoma
18
19
residents.
19
20
It is the intent of this act to establish penalties, including
20
21
deportation, to deter unconstitutional actions, protect
21
22
whistleblowers, and affirm Oklahoma’s responsibility to defend its
22
23
citizens’ rights and sovereignty.
