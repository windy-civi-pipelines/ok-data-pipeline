11 basis of the proportion which premiums written
12 for insurance accepted from companies
13 commercially domiciled in this state bears to
14 premiums written for reinsurance accepted from
15 all sources, or alternatively in the proportion
16 which the sum of the direct premiums written for
17 insurance on property or risks in this state by

19 accepted bears to the sum of the total direct
20 premiums written by each such ceding company for
21 the taxable year.

23 allocation in paragraph 4 of this subsection, being that which is
24 derived from a unitary business enterprise, shall be apportioned to

8 including the sale or other disposition of such property and any
9 other property used in the unitary enterprise. Deductions used in
10 computing such net income or loss shall not include taxes based on
11 or measured by income. Provided, for corporations whose property

13 initial investment cost equaling or exceeding Two Hundred Million
14 Dollars ($200,000,000.00) and such investment is made on or after
15 July 1, 1997, or for corporations which expand their property or
16 facilities in this state and such expansion has an investment cost
17 equaling or exceeding Two Hundred Million Dollars ($200,000,000.00)
18 over a period not to exceed three (3) years, and such expansion is
19 commenced on or after January 1, 2000, the three factors shall be
20 apportioned with property and payroll, each comprising twenty-five
21 percent (25%) of the apportionment factor and sales comprising fifty
22 percent (50%) of the apportionment factor. The apportionment
23 factors shall be computed as follows:
24
Req. No. 13260 Page 20
1 a. The property factor is a fraction, the numerator of
2 which is the average value of the taxpayer's real and
3 tangible personal property owned or rented and used in
4 this state during the tax period and the denominator
5 of which is the average value of all the taxpayer's
6 real and tangible personal property everywhere owned
7 or rented and used during the tax period.
8 (1) Property, the income from which is separately
9 allocated in paragraph 4 of this subsection,
10 shall not be included in determining this
11 fraction. The numerator of the fraction shall
12 include a portion of the investment in
13 transportation and other equipment having no
14 fixed situs, such as rolling stock, buses, trucks
15 and trailers, including machinery and equipment
16 carried thereon, airplanes, salespersons'
17 automobiles and other similar equipment, in the
18 proportion that miles traveled in this state by
19 such equipment bears to total miles traveled,
20 (2) Property owned by the taxpayer is valued at its
21 original cost. Property rented by the taxpayer
22 is valued at eight times the net annual rental
23 rate. Net annual rental rate is the annual
24 rental rate paid by the taxpayer, less any annual
Req. No. 13260 Page 21
1 rental rate received by the taxpayer from
2 subrentals,
3 (3) The average value of property shall be determined
4 by averaging the values at the beginning and
5 ending of the tax period but the Oklahoma Tax
6 Commission may require the averaging of monthly
7 values during the tax period if reasonably
8 required to reflect properly the average value of
9 the taxpayer's property;
10 b. The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of
11 which is the total compensation for services rendered
12 in the state during the tax period, and the
13 denominator of which is the total compensation for
14 services rendered everywhere during the tax period.
15 "Compensation", as used in this subsection, means
16 those paid-for services to the extent related to the
17 unitary business but does not include officers'
18 salaries, wages and other compensation.
19 (1) In the case of a transportation enterprise, the
20 numerator of the fraction shall include a portion
21 of such expenditure in connection with employees
22 operating equipment over a fixed route, such as
23 railroad employees, airline pilots, or bus
24 drivers, in this state only a part of the time,
Req. No. 13260 Page 22
1 in the proportion that mileage traveled in this
2 state bears to total mileage traveled by such
3 employees,
4 (2) In any case the numerator of the fraction shall
5 include a portion of such expenditures in
6 connection with itinerant employees, such as
7 traveling salespersons, in this state only a part
8 of the time, in the proportion that time spent in
9 this state bears to total time spent in
10 furtherance of the enterprise by such employees;
11 c. The sales factor is a fraction, the numerator of which
12 is the total sales or gross revenue of the taxpayer in
13 this state during the tax period, and the denominator
14 of which is the total sales or gross revenue of the
15 taxpayer everywhere during the tax period. "Sales",
16 as used in this subsection, does not include sales or
17 gross revenue which are separately allocated in
18 paragraph 4 of this subsection.
19 (1) Sales of tangible personal property have a situs
20 in this state if the property is delivered or
21 shipped to a purchaser other than the United
22 States government, within this state regardless
23 of the FOB point or other conditions of the sale;
24 or the property is shipped from an office, store,
Req. No. 13260 Page 23
1 warehouse, factory or other place of storage in
2 this state and (a) the purchaser is the United
3 States government or (b) the taxpayer is not
4 doing business in the state of the destination of
5 the shipment.
6 (2) In the case of a railroad or interurban railway
7 enterprise, the numerator of the fraction shall
8 not be less than the allocation of revenues to
9 this state as shown in its annual report to the
10 Corporation Commission.
11 (3) In the case of an airline, truck or bus
12 enterprise or freight car, tank car, refrigerator
13 car or other railroad equipment enterprise, the
14 numerator of the fraction shall include a portion
15 of revenue from interstate transportation in the
16 proportion that interstate mileage traveled in
17 this state bears to total interstate mileage
18 traveled.
19 (4) In the case of an oil, gasoline or gas pipeline
20 enterprise, the numerator of the fraction shall
21 be either the total of traffic units of the
22 enterprise within this state or the revenue
23 allocated to this state based upon miles moved,
24 at the option of the taxpayer, and the
Req. No. 13260 Page 24
1 denominator of which shall be the total of
2 traffic units of the enterprise or the revenue of
3 the enterprise everywhere as appropriate to the
4 numerator. A "traffic unit" is hereby defined as
5 the transportation for a distance of one (1) mile
6 of one (1) barrel of oil, one (1) gallon of
7 gasoline or one thousand (1,000) cubic feet of
8 natural or casinghead gas, as the case may be.
9 (5) In the case of a telephone or telegraph or other
10 communication enterprise, the numerator of the
11 fraction shall include that portion of the
12 interstate revenue as is allocated pursuant to
13 the accounting procedures prescribed by the
14 Federal Communications Commission; provided that
15 in respect to each corporation or business entity
16 required by the Federal Communications Commission
17 to keep its books and records in accordance with
18 a uniform system of accounts prescribed by such
19 Commission, the intrastate net income shall be
20 determined separately in the manner provided by
21 such uniform system of accounts and only the
22 interstate income shall be subject to allocation
23 pursuant to the provisions of this subsection.
24 Provided further, that the gross revenue factors
Req. No. 13260 Page 25
1 shall be those as are determined pursuant to the
2 accounting procedures prescribed by the Federal
3 Communications Commission.
4 In any case where the apportionment of the three factors
5 prescribed in this paragraph attributes to this state a portion of
6 net income of the enterprise out of all appropriate proportion to
7 the property owned and/or business transacted within this state,
8 because of the fact that one or more of the factors so prescribed
9 are not employed to any appreciable extent in furtherance of the
10 enterprise; or because one or more factors not so prescribed are
11 employed to a considerable extent in furtherance of the enterprise;
12 or because of other reasons, the Tax Commission is empowered to
13 permit, after a showing by taxpayer that an excessive portion of net
14 income has been attributed to this state, or require, when in its
15 judgment an insufficient portion of net income has been attributed
16 to this state, the elimination, substitution, or use of additional
17 factors, or reduction or increase in the weight of such prescribed
18 factors. Provided, however, that any such variance from such
19 prescribed factors which has the effect of increasing the portion of
20 net income attributable to this state must not be inherently
21 arbitrary, and application of the recomputed final apportionment to
22 the net income of the enterprise must attribute to this state only a
23 reasonable portion thereof.

7 and all subsequent years, the percentage, not to exceed fifteen
8 percent (15%), available to the owner of a new or expanded

11 reduction in tax liability does not exceed One Million Dollars
12 ($1,000,000.00) annually. The Tax Commission shall promulgate rules
13 for determining the percentage of the investment which each eligible
14 taxpayer may exclude. The exclusion provided by this paragraph
15 shall be taken in the taxable year when the investment is made. In
16 the event the total reduction in tax liability authorized by this
17 paragraph exceeds One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) in any
18 calendar year, the Tax Commission shall permit any excess over One
19 Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) and shall factor such excess into
20 the percentage for subsequent years. Any amount of the exemption
21 permitted to be excluded pursuant to the provisions of this
22 paragraph but not used in any year may be carried forward as an
23 exemption from income pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph

21 and 2 of this subsection, apportioned as follows:
22 (1) except as otherwise provided by division (2) of
23 this subparagraph, taxable income of an insurance
24 company for a taxable year shall be apportioned
Req. No. 13260 Page 17

1 to this state by multiplying such income by a
2 fraction, the numerator of which is the direct
3 premiums written for insurance on property or

11 basis of the proportion which premiums written
12 for insurance accepted from companies
13 commercially domiciled in this state bears to
14 premiums written for reinsurance accepted from
15 all sources, or alternatively in the proportion
16 which the sum of the direct premiums written for
17 insurance on property or risks in this state by
18 each ceding company from which reinsurance is
19 accepted bears to the sum of the total direct
20 premiums written by each such ceding company for
21 the taxable year.
22 5. The net income or loss remaining after the separate
23 allocation in paragraph 4 of this subsection, being that which is
24 derived from a unitary business enterprise, shall be apportioned to
Req. No. 13260 Page 19

1 this state on the basis of the arithmetical average of three factors
2 consisting of property, payroll and sales or gross revenue
3 enumerated as subparagraphs a, b and c of this paragraph. Net
4 income or loss as used in this paragraph includes that derived from
5 patent or copyright royalties, purchase discounts, and interest on
6 accounts receivable relating to or arising from a business activity,
7 the income from which is apportioned pursuant to this subsection,
8 including the sale or other disposition of such property and any
9 other property used in the unitary enterprise. Deductions used in
10 computing such net income or loss shall not include taxes based on
11 or measured by income. Provided, for corporations whose property
12 for purposes of the tax imposed by Section 2355 of this title has an
13 initial investment cost equaling or exceeding Two Hundred Million
14 Dollars ($200,000,000.00) and such investment is made on or after
15 July 1, 1997, or for corporations which expand their property or
16 facilities in this state and such expansion has an investment cost
17 equaling or exceeding Two Hundred Million Dollars ($200,000,000.00)
18 over a period not to exceed three (3) years, and such expansion is
19 commenced on or after January 1, 2000, the three factors shall be
20 apportioned with property and payroll, each comprising twenty-five
21 percent (25%) of the apportionment factor and sales comprising fifty
22 percent (50%) of the apportionment factor. The apportionment
23 factors shall be computed as follows:
24
Req. No. 13260 Page 20

1 a. The property factor is a fraction, the numerator of
2 which is the average value of the taxpayer's real and
3 tangible personal property owned or rented and used in
4 this state during the tax period and the denominator
5 of which is the average value of all the taxpayer's
6 real and tangible personal property everywhere owned
7 or rented and used during the tax period.
8 (1) Property, the income from which is separately
9 allocated in paragraph 4 of this subsection,
10 shall not be included in determining this
11 fraction. The numerator of the fraction shall
12 include a portion of the investment in
13 transportation and other equipment having no
14 fixed situs, such as rolling stock, buses, trucks
15 and trailers, including machinery and equipment
16 carried thereon, airplanes, salespersons'
17 automobiles and other similar equipment, in the
18 proportion that miles traveled in this state by
19 such equipment bears to total miles traveled,
20 (2) Property owned by the taxpayer is valued at its
21 original cost. Property rented by the taxpayer
22 is valued at eight times the net annual rental
23 rate. Net annual rental rate is the annual
24 rental rate paid by the taxpayer, less any annual
Req. No. 13260 Page 21

1 rental rate received by the taxpayer from
2 subrentals,
3 (3) The average value of property shall be determined
4 by averaging the values at the beginning and
5 ending of the tax period but the Oklahoma Tax
6 Commission may require the averaging of monthly
7 values during the tax period if reasonably
8 required to reflect properly the average value of
9 the taxpayer's property;
10 b. The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of
11 which is the total compensation for services rendered
12 in the state during the tax period, and the
13 denominator of which is the total compensation for
14 services rendered everywhere during the tax period.
15 "Compensation", as used in this subsection, means
16 those paid-for services to the extent related to the
17 unitary business but does not include officers'
18 salaries, wages and other compensation.
19 (1) In the case of a transportation enterprise, the
20 numerator of the fraction shall include a portion
21 of such expenditure in connection with employees
22 operating equipment over a fixed route, such as
23 railroad employees, airline pilots, or bus
24 drivers, in this state only a part of the time,
Req. No. 13260 Page 22

1 in the proportion that mileage traveled in this
2 state bears to total mileage traveled by such
3 employees,
4 (2) In any case the numerator of the fraction shall
5 include a portion of such expenditures in
6 connection with itinerant employees, such as
7 traveling salespersons, in this state only a part
8 of the time, in the proportion that time spent in
9 this state bears to total time spent in
10 furtherance of the enterprise by such employees;
11 c. The sales factor is a fraction, the numerator of which
12 is the total sales or gross revenue of the taxpayer in
13 this state during the tax period, and the denominator
14 of which is the total sales or gross revenue of the
15 taxpayer everywhere during the tax period. "Sales",
16 as used in this subsection, does not include sales or
17 gross revenue which are separately allocated in
18 paragraph 4 of this subsection.
19 (1) Sales of tangible personal property have a situs
20 in this state if the property is delivered or
21 shipped to a purchaser other than the United
22 States government, within this state regardless
23 of the FOB point or other conditions of the sale;
24 or the property is shipped from an office, store,
Req. No. 13260 Page 23

1 warehouse, factory or other place of storage in
2 this state and (a) the purchaser is the United
3 States government or (b) the taxpayer is not
4 doing business in the state of the destination of
5 the shipment.
6 (2) In the case of a railroad or interurban railway
7 enterprise, the numerator of the fraction shall
8 not be less than the allocation of revenues to
9 this state as shown in its annual report to the
10 Corporation Commission.
11 (3) In the case of an airline, truck or bus
12 enterprise or freight car, tank car, refrigerator
13 car or other railroad equipment enterprise, the
14 numerator of the fraction shall include a portion
15 of revenue from interstate transportation in the
16 proportion that interstate mileage traveled in
17 this state bears to total interstate mileage
18 traveled.
19 (4) In the case of an oil, gasoline or gas pipeline
20 enterprise, the numerator of the fraction shall
21 be either the total of traffic units of the
22 enterprise within this state or the revenue
23 allocated to this state based upon miles moved,
24 at the option of the taxpayer, and the
Req. No. 13260 Page 24

1 denominator of which shall be the total of
2 traffic units of the enterprise or the revenue of
3 the enterprise everywhere as appropriate to the
4 numerator. A "traffic unit" is hereby defined as
5 the transportation for a distance of one (1) mile
6 of one (1) barrel of oil, one (1) gallon of
7 gasoline or one thousand (1,000) cubic feet of
8 natural or casinghead gas, as the case may be.
9 (5) In the case of a telephone or telegraph or other
10 communication enterprise, the numerator of the
11 fraction shall include that portion of the
12 interstate revenue as is allocated pursuant to
13 the accounting procedures prescribed by the
14 Federal Communications Commission; provided that
15 in respect to each corporation or business entity
16 required by the Federal Communications Commission
17 to keep its books and records in accordance with
18 a uniform system of accounts prescribed by such
19 Commission, the intrastate net income shall be
20 determined separately in the manner provided by
21 such uniform system of accounts and only the
22 interstate income shall be subject to allocation
23 pursuant to the provisions of this subsection.
24 Provided further, that the gross revenue factors
Req. No. 13260 Page 25

1 shall be those as are determined pursuant to the
2 accounting procedures prescribed by the Federal
3 Communications Commission.
4 In any case where the apportionment of the three factors
5 prescribed in this paragraph attributes to this state a portion of
6 net income of the enterprise out of all appropriate proportion to
7 the property owned and/or business transacted within this state,
8 because of the fact that one or more of the factors so prescribed
9 are not employed to any appreciable extent in furtherance of the
10 enterprise; or because one or more factors not so prescribed are
11 employed to a considerable extent in furtherance of the enterprise;
12 or because of other reasons, the Tax Commission is empowered to
13 permit, after a showing by taxpayer that an excessive portion of net
14 income has been attributed to this state, or require, when in its
15 judgment an insufficient portion of net income has been attributed
16 to this state, the elimination, substitution, or use of additional
17 factors, or reduction or increase in the weight of such prescribed
18 factors. Provided, however, that any such variance from such
19 prescribed factors which has the effect of increasing the portion of
20 net income attributable to this state must not be inherently
21 arbitrary, and application of the recomputed final apportionment to
22 the net income of the enterprise must attribute to this state only a
23 reasonable portion thereof.

7 and all subsequent years, the percentage, not to exceed fifteen
8 percent (15%), available to the owner of a new or expanded
9 agricultural commodity processing facility in this state claiming
10 the exemption shall be adjusted annually so that the total estimated
11 reduction in tax liability does not exceed One Million Dollars
12 ($1,000,000.00) annually. The Tax Commission shall promulgate rules
