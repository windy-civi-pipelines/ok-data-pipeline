7 fraction, the numerator of which is the direct

2 numerator of which is the sum of (a) direct
3 premiums written for insurance on property or
4 risks in this state, plus (b) premiums written
5 for reinsurance accepted in respect of property
6 or risks in this state, and the denominator of
7 which is the sum of (c) direct premiums written
8 for insurance on property or risks everywhere,

11 everywhere. For purposes of this paragraph,
12 premiums written for reinsurance accepted in
13 respect of property or risks in this state,

15 election of the company be determined on the
16 basis of the proportion which premiums written

19 premiums written for reinsurance accepted from
20 all sources, or alternatively in the proportion
21 which the sum of the direct premiums written for
22 insurance on property or risks in this state by
23 each ceding company from which reinsurance is
24 accepted bears to the sum of the total direct

2 the taxable year.
3 5. The net income or loss remaining after the separate
4 allocation in paragraph 4 of this subsection, being that which is

8 enumerated as subparagraphs a, b and c of this paragraph. Net
9 income or loss as used in this paragraph includes that derived from
10 patent or copyright royalties, purchase discounts, and interest on

1 appo rtioned with property and payroll, each comprising twenty-five
2 percent (25%) of the apportionment factor and sales comprising fifty
3 percent (50%) of the apportionment factor. The apportionment
4 factors shall be computed as follows:
5 a. The property factor is a fraction, the numerator of
6 which is the average value of the taxpayer's real and
7 tangible personal property owned or rented and used in
8 this state during the tax period and the denominator
9 of which is the average value of all the taxpayer's
10 real and tangible personal property everywhere owned
11 or rented and used during the tax period.
12 (1) Property, the income from which is separately
13 allocated in paragraph 4 of this subsection,
14 shall not be included in determining this
15 fraction. The numerator of the fraction shall
16 include a portion of the investment in

1 (2) Property owned by the taxpayer is valued at its
2 original cost. Property rented by the taxpayer
3 is valued at eight times the net annual rental
4 rate. Net annual rental rate is the annual
5 rental rate paid by the taxpayer, less any annual
6 rental rate received by the taxpayer from
7 subrentals,
8 (3) The average value of property shall be determined
9 by averaging the values at the beginning and
10 ending of the tax period but the Oklahoma Tax
11 Commission may require the averaging of monthly
12 values during the tax period if reasonably
13 required to reflect properly the average value of
14 the taxpayer's property;
15 b. The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of
16 which is the total compensation for services rendered
17 in the state during the tax period, and the
18 denominator of which is the total compensation for
19 services rendered everywhere during the tax period.
20 "Compensation", as used in this subsection, means
21 those paid-for services to the extent related to the
22 unitary business but does not include officers'
23 salaries, wages and other compensation.

3 of such expenditure in connection with employees
4 operating equipment over a fixed route, such as
5 railroad employees, airline pilots, or bus
6 drivers, in this state only a part of the time,
7 in the proportion that mileage traveled in this
8 state bears to total mileage traveled by such
9 employees,
10 (2) In any case the numerator of the fraction shall
11 include a portion of such expenditures in
12 connection with itinerant employees, such as
13 traveling salespersons, in this state only a part
14 of the time, in the proportion that time spent in
15 this state bears to total time spent in
16 furtherance of the enterprise by such employees;
17 c. The sales factor is a fraction, the numerator of which
18 is the total sales or gross revenue of the taxpayer in
19 this state during the tax period, and the denominator
20 of which is the total sales or gross revenue of the
21 taxpayer everywhere during the tax period. "Sales",
22 as used in this subsection, does not include sales or
23 gross revenue which are separately allocated in
24 paragraph 4 of this subsection.

8 this state and (a) the purchaser is the United
9 States government or (b) the taxpayer is not
10 doing business in the state of the destination of
11 the shipment.
12 (2) In the case of a railroad or interurban railway
13 enterprise, the numerator of the fraction shall
14 not be less than the allocation of revenues to
15 this state as shown in its annual report to the
16 Corporation Commission.
17 (3) In the case of an airline, truck or bus
18 enterprise or freight car, tank car, refrigerator
19 car or other railroad equipment enterprise, the
20 numerator of the fraction shall include a portion
21 of revenue from interstate transportation in the
22 proportion that interstate mileage traveled in

1 (4) In the case of an oil, gasoline or gas pipeline
2 enterprise, the numerator of the fraction shall

5 allocated to this state based upon miles moved,
6 at the option of the taxpayer, and the
7 denominator of which shall be the total of
8 traffic units of the enterprise or the revenue of
9 the enterprise everywhere as appropriate to the
10 numerator. A "traffic unit" is hereby defined as
11 the transportation for a distance of one (1) mile
12 of one (1) barrel of oil, one (1) gallon of
13 gasoline or one thousand (1,000) cubic feet of
14 natural or casinghead gas, as the case may be.
15 (5) In the case of a telephone or telegraph or other
16 communication enterprise, the numerator of the
17 fraction shall include that portion of the
18 interstate revenue as is allocated pursuant to
19 the accounting procedures prescribed by the
20 Federal Communications Commission; provided that
21 in respect to each corporation or business entity
22 required by the Federal Communications Commission

5 pursuant to the provisions of this subsection.
6 Provided further, that the gross revenue factors
7 shall be those as are determined pursuant to the
8 accounting procedures prescribed by the Federal
9 Communications Commission.
10 In any case where the apportionment of the three factors
11 prescribed in this paragraph attributes to this state a portion of
12 net income of the enterprise out of all appropriate proportion to
13 the property owned and/or business transacted within this state,
14 because of the fact that one or more of the factors so prescribed
15 are not employed to any appreciable extent in furtherance of the
16 enterprise; or because one or more factors not so prescribed are
17 employed to a considerable extent in furtherance of the enterprise;
18 or because of other reasons, the Tax Commission is empowered to
19 permit, after a showing by taxpayer that an excessive portion of net
20 income has been attributed to this state, or require, when in its
21 judgment an insufficient portion of net income has been attributed
22 to this state, the elimination, substitution, or use of additional
23 factors, or reduction or increase in the weight of such prescribed
24 factors. Provided, however, that any such variance from such
HB2740 HFLR Page 26

1 pres cribed factors which has the effect of increasing the portion of
2 net income attributable to this state must not be inherently
3 arbitrary, and application of the recomputed final apportionment to
4 the net income of the enterprise must attribute to this state only a
5 reasonable portion thereof.

7 expanded agricultural commodity processing facility in this state
8 may exclude from Oklahoma taxable income, or in the case of an
9 individual, the Oklahoma adjusted gross income, fifteen percent
10 (15%) of the investment by the owner in the new or expanded

13 percent (15%), available to the owner of a new or expanded
14 agricultural commodity processing facility in this state claiming
15 the exemption shall be adjusted annually so that the total estimated
16 reduction in tax liability does not exceed One Million Dollars
17 ($1,000,000.00) annually. The Tax Commission shall promulgate rules
18 for determining the percentage of the investment which each eligible
19 taxpayer may exclude. The exclusion provided by this paragraph
