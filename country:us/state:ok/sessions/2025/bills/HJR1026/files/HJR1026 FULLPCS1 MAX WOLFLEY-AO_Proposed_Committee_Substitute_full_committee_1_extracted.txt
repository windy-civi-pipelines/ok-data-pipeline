4 upon the property during the first year in which the individual head
5 of household was sixty-five (65) years of age or older and had gross
6 household income from all sources which did not exceed an amount as
7 provided in subsection B of this section. Subject to the
8 limitations of this section, the fair cash value shall not exceed
9 such amount as long as the individual head of household who is
10 sixty-five (65) years of age or older owns and occupies the property
11 and as long as the gross household income from all sources does not
12 exceed an amount as provided in subsection B of this section. If
13 any improvements are made to the property, the fair cash value of
14 the improvements shall be assessed in accordance with law by the
15 county assessor and added to the assessed value of the property.
16 Once the fair cash value of the improvements has been added to the
17 fair cash value of the property, the total fair cash value shall not
18 exceed the revised valuation of the property so long as the
19 individual head of household who is sixty-five (65) years of age or
20 older owns and occupies the property and so long as the gross
21 household income from all sources does not exceed an amount as
22 provided in subsection B of this section. For any individual head
23 of household who is sixty-five (65) years of age or older prior to
24 January 1, 1997, and has gross household income from all sources of
Req. No. 12602 Page 2

2 1996, the fair cash value of the real property shall be the fair
3 cash value placed upon the property on January 1, 1997. If the
4 individual head of household ceases to own and occupy the property
5 or if the gross household income from all sources exceeds an amount
6 as provided in subsection B of this section, the fair cash value of
7 the property shall be determined as if the provisions of Section 8
8 of Article X of the Constitution of the State of Oklahoma or any
9 other provisions relating to a limitation on the fair cash value of
10 locally assessed real property had been in effect during the time
11 the property was valued pursuant to the provisions of this section.

13 sources for an individual head of household under this section shall
14 not exceed triple the amount determined by the United States
15 Department of Housing and Urban Development to be the estimated
16 median income for the preceding year for the county or metropolitan

3 This measure amends the Oklahoma Constitution. It amends
4 Section 8C of Article 10. Persons age 65 or older can qualify
5 for a property tax benefit. The benefit means that the fair
6 cash value of the homestead property for the owner cannot
7 increase after the person reaches age 65 and is otherwise
8 qualified. There is a limit on the income a person can receive
9 and still have this property tax benefit. Currently, the amount
10 of income you can receive and qualify for this property tax
11 benefit is equal to the amount determined by the United States
12 Department of Housing and Urban Development to be an estimated
13 median income amount of the county for the preceding year. This
14 measure would change the income limit to qualify for this
15 property tax benefit from the median income amount for each
16 county of the state to triple the median income of the entire
17 state. This would increase the number of homeowners eligible
18 for the benefit.
