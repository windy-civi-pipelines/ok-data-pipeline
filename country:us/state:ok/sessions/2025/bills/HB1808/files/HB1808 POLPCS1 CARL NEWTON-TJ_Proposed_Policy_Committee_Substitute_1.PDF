7 SECTION 2. NEW LAW A new section of law to be codified
8 in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 6110.1 of Title 36, unless there
9 is created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:
10 1. A health insurance or other health benefit plan offered by a
11 health insurer or by a pharmacy benefit manager on behalf of a
12 health insurer that provides coverage for prescription drugs and
13 uses step-therapy protocols shall:
14 a. not require failure, including discontinuation due to
15 lack of efficacy or effectiveness, diminished effect,
16 or an adverse event, on the same medication on more
17 than one occasion for insureds who are continuously
18 enrolled in a plan offered by the insurer or its
19 pharmacy benefit manager, and
20 b. grant an exception to its step-therapy protocols upon
21 request of an insured or the insured's treating health
22 care professional under the same time parameters as
23 set forth for prior authorization requests if any one
24 or more of the following conditions apply:
Req. No. 12587 Page 2

1 (1) the prescription drug required under the step-
2 therapy protocol is contraindicated or will
3 likely cause an adverse reaction or physical or
4 mental harm to the insured,
5 (2) the prescription drug required under the step-
6 therapy protocol is expected to be ineffective
7 based on the insured's known clinical history,
8 condition, and prescription drug regimen,
9 (3) the insured has already tried the prescription
10 drugs on the protocol, or other prescription
11 drugs in the same pharmacologic class or with the
12 same mechanism of action, which have been

18 (4) the insured is stable on a prescription drug
19 selected by the insured's treating health care
20 professional for the medical condition under
21 consideration, or

12 B. In developing its rules, bulletins, or other guidance, the
13 Department may rely on prior authorization data submitted by the
14 health plans.

17 to this subsection should be designed to apply to frequently used
