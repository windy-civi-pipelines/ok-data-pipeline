19 contracting entity's receipt of the written objection,
20 and the contracting entity shall work together with
21 the provider to achieve a reasonable resolution to the
22 objection within sixty (60) days following the
23 provider's receipt of contracting entity's initial
24 substantive response. If the provider is not
Req. No. 10370 Page 12
1 satisfied with the proposed resolution, the provider
2 may pursue any remedy available to the provider under
3 the health care contract or under applicable law.
4 C. For purposes of this section, a health care contract is
5 deemed to be amended when a contracting entity institutes a new

3 authorization requirements for any generic medication or for any
4 admission, item, service, treatment, procedure, or medication, or
5 for any category of these, that have low variation across health
6 care providers and denial rates of less than ten percent (10%)
7 across carriers.
8 B. In developing its rules, bulletins, or other guidance, the
9 Department may rely on prior authorization data submitted by the
10 health plans.
11 C. It is the intent of the Legislature that the rules,
12 bulletins, or other guidance that the Department develops pursuant
13 to this subsection should be designed to apply to frequently used
14 medications and services, especially those ordered by primary care
15 providers, and to achieve consistency in prior authorization
16 exemptions across health plans in order to meaningfully reduce the
17 administrative burden on health care providers.
18 SECTION 6. NEW LAW A new section of law to be codified
19 in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 6110.5 of Title 36, unless there
20 is created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:

7 same specialty typically uses or that the requesting
8 provider actually bills. Fee schedule information may

10 contracting entity, but a provider may elect to
11 receive a paper copy of the fee schedule information
12 instead of the electronic version, and
13 c. a clearly understandable, readily available mechanism,
14 such as a specific website address, that includes the

1 (4) any significant edits, as determined by the
2 health plan, contracting entity, covered entity,

4 which are made at the request of the health plan,
5 contracting entity, covered entity, or payer, and
6 which have been approved by the Commissioner, and
7 d. any policies for prepayment or post-payment audits, or
8 both, including whether the policies include limits on
9 the number of medical records a contracting entity may
10 request for audit in any calendar year.
11 B. If a contracting entity uses policies or manuals to augment
12 the content of the contract with a health care provider, the
13 contracting entity shall ensure that those policies or manuals
14 contain sufficient information to allow providers to understand and
15 comply with the content. The contracting entity shall treat any new
16 policy or manual, and any change to an existing policy or manual, as
17 a contract amendment and shall comply with the requirements for
18 contract amendments.
19 1. For any new policy or manual, or any change to an existing
20 policy or manual, the contracting entity shall do all of the
21 following:
22 a. provide notice of the new policy, manual, or change to
23 each participating provider in writing not fewer than
24 sixty (60) days prior to the effective date of the
Req. No. 10370 Page 11

1 policy, manual, or change, which notice shall be
2 conspicuously entitled "Notice of Policy Change" and
3 shall include:
4 (1) a summary of the new policy, manual, or change,
5 (2) an explanation of the policy, manual, or change,
6 (3) the effective date of the policy, manual, or
7 change, and
8 (4) a notice of the right to object in writing to the
9 policy, manual, or change, along with a timeframe
10 for objection and where and how to send the
11 objection.
12 b. provide the participating provider sixty (60) days
13 after receiving the notice and summary to object in
14 writing to the new policy, manual, or change. If the
15 participating provider objects to the new policy,
16 manual, or change, the contracting entity shall
17 provide an initial substantive response to the
18 objection within thirty (30) days following the
19 contracting entity's receipt of the written objection,
20 and the contracting entity shall work together with
21 the provider to achieve a reasonable resolution to the
22 objection within sixty (60) days following the
23 provider's receipt of contracting entity's initial
24 substantive response. If the provider is not
Req. No. 10370 Page 12

1 satisfied with the proposed resolution, the provider
2 may pursue any remedy available to the provider under
3 the health care contract or under applicable law.
4 C. For purposes of this section, a health care contract is
5 deemed to be amended when a contracting entity institutes a new
6 policy or manual, or amends an existing policy or manual that is
7 incorporated into a contract by reference, and the new or amended
8 policy or manual impacts the health care provider's reimbursement.
9 SECTION 7. NEW LAW A new section of law to be codified
10 in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 6110.6 of Title 36, unless there
11 is created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:
12 For any violation of the provisions of this act or any rule
13 adopted pursuant thereto, the Insurance Commissioner may, upon
14 notice and hearing, subject a person or entity to a civil fine of
15 not less than One Hundred Dollars ($100.00) nor more than One
16 Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00) for each occurrence.
