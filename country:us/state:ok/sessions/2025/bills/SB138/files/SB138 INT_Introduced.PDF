21
22
that is claimed must be stated. When interest is
22
23
claimed, it is not necessary to state the rate of
23
24
interest, the date from which interest is claimed
24
Req. No. 473 Page 16

or that interest is claimed until the obligation
1
2
is paid.
2
3
(2) It is not necessary for the publication notice to
3
4
state that the judgment will include recovery of
4
5
costs in order for a judgment following the
5
6
publication notice to include costs of suit.
6
7
(3) In an action to quiet title to real property, it
7
8
is not necessary for the publication notice to
8
9
state the nature of the claim or interest of
9
10
either party, and in describing the nature of the
10
11
judgment that will be rendered should the
11
12
defendant fail to answer, it is sufficient to
12
13
state that a decree quieting plaintiff’s title to
13
14
the described property will be entered. It is
14
15
not necessary to state that a decree forever
15
16
barring the defendant from asserting any interest
16
17
in or to the property is sought or will be
17
18
entered if the defendant does not answer.
18

6
manner and for the time prescribed in subparagraph c

7
of this paragraph. Service by publication shall be
7
8
proved by the affidavit of any person having knowledge
8
9
of the publication. No default judgment may be
9
10
entered on such service until proof of service by
10
11
publication is filed with and approved by the court.
11
12
e. Before entry of a default judgment or order against a
12
13
party who has been served solely by publication under
13
14
this paragraph, the court shall conduct an inquiry to
14
15
determine whether the plaintiff, or someone acting in
15
16
behalf of the plaintiff, made a distinct and
16
17
meaningful search of all reasonably available sources
17
18
to ascertain the whereabouts of any named parties who
18
19
have been served solely by publication under this
19
20
paragraph. Before entry of a default judgment or
20
21
order against the unknown successors of a named

22
23
partnership, corporation or association, the court

paragraph have been satisfied.
2
3
f. A party against whom a default judgment or order has
3
4
been rendered, without other service than by
4
5
publication in a newspaper, may, at any time within
5
6
three (3) years after the filing of the judgment or
6
7
order, have the judgment or order set aside in the
7
8
manner prescribed in Sections 1031.1 and 1033 of this
8
9
title. Before the judgment or order is set aside, the
9
10
applicant shall notify the adverse party of the
10
11
intention to make an application and shall file a full
11
12
answer to the petition, pay all costs if the court
12
13
requires them to be paid and satisfy the court by
13
14
affidavit or other evidence that during the pendency
14
15
of the action the applicant had no actual notice
15
16
thereof in time to appear in court and make a defense.
16
17
The title to any property which is the subject of and
17
18
which passes to a purchaser in good faith by or in
18
19
consequence of the judgment or order to be opened
19
20
shall not be affected by any proceedings under this
20
21
subparagraph. Nor shall proceedings under this
21
22
subparagraph affect the title of any property sold
22
23
before judgment under an attachment. The adverse

24
party, on the hearing of an application to open a
24
Req. No. 473 Page 19

1
judgment or order as provided by this subparagraph,
1

administrators, devisees, trustees and assigns,
7
8
immediate and remote, of a named individual,

partnership, corporation or association.
9
10
h. Service outside of the state does not give the court
10
11
in personal jurisdiction over a defendant who is not
11
12
subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of this
12
13
state or who has not, either in person or through an
13
14

plaintiff.
14
15
If any of these addresses are the same, the plaintiff
15
16
is not required to attempt service more than once at
16
17
any address. The plaintiff shall furnish the
17
18
Secretary of State with a certified copy of the return
18
19

1
of State the fee prescribed in paragraph 7 of

2
3
Oklahoma Statutes, which fee shall be taxed as part of

11
12
could be found at the registered office of the
12
13
corporation.
13
14
d. Within three (3) working days after receiving the
14
15
summons and petition, the Secretary of State shall
15
16
send notice by letter, certified mail, return receipt
16
17
requested, directed to the corporation at its
17
18
registered office or the last-known address found in
18
19
the office of the Secretary of State, or if no address
19
20
is found there, to the corporation’s last-known
20
21
address provided by the plaintiff. The notice shall
21
22
enclose a copy of the summons and petition and any
22
23
other papers served upon the Secretary of State. The
23
24
corporation shall not be required to serve its answer
24
Req. No. 473 Page 22

petition on the Secretary of State.

3
4
corporation that has been served by serving the
4
5
Secretary of State as its agent under this paragraph,
5
6
the court shall determine whether the requirements of
6
7
this paragraph have been satisfied. A default
7
8
judgment or order against a corporation that has been
8
9
served only by service on the Secretary of State may
9
10
be set aside upon motion of the corporation in the
10
11
manner prescribed in Section 1031.1 of this title, or
11
12
upon petition of the corporation in the manner
12

prescribed in Section 1033 of this title, if the
13
14
corporation demonstrates to the court that it had no
14
15
actual notice of the action in time to appear and make
15
16
its defense. A petition shall be filed within one (1)
16
17
year after the corporation has notice of the default
17
18
judgment or order but in no event more than two (2)
18
19
years after the filing of the default judgment or
19
20
order.
20
21
f. The Secretary of State shall maintain an alphabetical
21
22
record of service setting forth the name of the

23
plaintiff and defendant, the title, docket number and

24
nature of the proceeding in which the process has been
24
Req. No. 473 Page 23

1
served upon the defendant, the fact that service has
1
2
been effected pursuant to the provisions of this
2
3
paragraph, the return date thereof and the date when
3
4
the service was made. The Secretary of State shall
4
5
not be required to retain this information for a
5
6
period longer than five (5) years from receipt of the
6
7
service of process.
7
8
g. The provisions of this paragraph shall not apply to a
8
9
foreign insurance company doing business in this
9
10
state.
10
11
5. 6. SERVICE BY ACKNOWLEDGMENT. An acknowledgment on the back
11
12
of the summons or the voluntary appearance of a defendant is
12
13
equivalent to service.
13
14
6. 7. SERVICE BY OTHER METHODS. If service cannot be made by
14
15
personal delivery or, by mail, or by secured electronic means, a
15
16
defendant of any class referred to in division (1) or (3) of
16
17
subparagraph c of paragraph 1 of this subsection may be served as
17
18
provided by court order in a manner which is reasonably calculated
18
19
to give the defendant actual notice of the proceedings and an
19
20
opportunity to be heard and upon filing an affidavit by the
20
21
plaintiff or plaintiff’s attorney that with due diligence service
21
22
cannot otherwise be made upon the defendant.
22
23
7. 8. NO SERVICE BY PRISONER. No prisoner in any jail,
23
24
Department of Corrections facility, private prison, or parolee or
24
Req. No. 473 Page 24

probationer under supervision of the Department of Corrections shall
1
2
be appointed by any court to serve process on any defendant, party
2
3
or witness.
3
4
D. SUMMONS AND PETITION. The summons and petition shall be
4
5
served together. The plaintiff shall furnish the person making
5
6
service with such copies as are necessary. The failure to serve a
6
7
copy of the petition with the summons is not a ground for dismissal
7
8
for insufficiency of service of process, but on motion of the party
8
9
served, the court may extend the time to answer or otherwise plead.
9
10
If a summons and petition are served by personal delivery, the
10
11
person serving the summons shall state on the copy that is left with
11
12
the person served the date that service is made. This provision is
12
13
not jurisdictional, but if the failure to comply with it prejudices
13
14
the party served, the court, on motion of the party served, may
14
15
extend the time to answer or otherwise plead.
15
16
E. SUMMONS: TERRITORIAL LIMITS OF EFFECTIVE SERVICE.
