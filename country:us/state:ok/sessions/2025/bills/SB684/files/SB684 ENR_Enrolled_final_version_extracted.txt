shall not be used for any other purpose. A taxpayer claiming the
credit authorized by paragraph 1 of subsection C of this section
shall submit to the Commission an enrollment verification form from
the private school in which the eligible student is enrolled or is
expected to enroll with the tuition and fees to be charged the
taxpayer for the applicable school year. In reviewing applications
submitted by eligible taxpayers to determine whether they qualify
for a credit authorized by paragraph 1 of subsection C of this

Section 27:
section, the Commission shall give first preference in making
installments payments to taxpayers who qualify pursuant to
subparagraphs a and b of paragraph 1 of subsection C of this

applications shall be submitted to the Commission within the first
sixty (60) days of the opening of the application period to receive
priority consideration. For students enrolled in the full school

paid in two installments, one per school semester, to be paid no

the total expected amount of tuition and fees on the enrollment
verification form submitted pursuant to this subsection.
F. In the event there are more applications submitted by
eligible taxpayers for a credit authorized by paragraph 1 of
subsection C of this section than available credits pursuant to
subsection D of this section, then the Commission shall give first
preference in authorizing credits for eligible students of taxpayers
who qualify pursuant to subparagraphs a and b of paragraph 1 of
subsection C of this section and have received the credit in the
prior year.
G. Taxpayers claiming the credit shall:

taxpayer has claimed an eligible student who no longer attends a
private school or has enrolled in a public school in the state.

Section 36:

adjustment shall be Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000.00) divided by
the amount of credit claimed in the second preceding tax year. In
the event the total tax credits authorized by this section exceed
the annual limit in any tax year, the Tax Commission shall permit
any excess but shall factor such excess into the percentage
adjustment formula for subsequent tax years.
3. If a taxpayer, on behalf of an eligible student in the
program, chooses not to participate, is no longer eligible to
participate, or chooses to forgo participation in the program for
any reason, the credit authorized by paragraph 1 of subsection C of
this section but not used and not reallocated pursuant to paragraph
3 of subsection H of this section shall be added to the subsequent
ENR. S. B. NO. 684 Page 8

fiscal year limitation as provided in paragraph 1 of this
subsection.

of subsection C of this section shall submit an application
prescribed by the Commission to receive the credit in two
installments, each of which shall be half of the expected amount of
tuition and fees for the private school based on the enrollment
verification form submitted pursuant to this subsection, but in no
event shall an installment a payment exceed the amount of the credit
authorized by paragraph 1 of subsection C of this section. If an
eligible taxpayer provides documentation on the application that he
or she is a recipient of income-based government benefits including
the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Temporary
Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), or SoonerCare the Oklahoma
Medicaid Program commonly known as SoonerCare, the eligible taxpayer
shall not be required to provide additional income verification.
The Department of Human Services and the Oklahoma Health Care
Authority shall, upon request by the Oklahoma Tax Commission, verify
whether an applicant receives income-based government benefits. The
taxpayer shall provide authorization for the Oklahoma Tax Commission
to disclose application data to the Department of Human Services
and/or the Oklahoma Health Care Authority, and for the Department of
Human Services and/or the Oklahoma Health Care Authority to provide
confirmation of benefits to the Oklahoma Tax Commission for purposes
of verifying that the taxpayer is a current recipient of SNAP, TANF,
or Oklahoma Medicaid Program benefits; provided, the information
shall not be used for any other purpose. A taxpayer claiming the
credit authorized by paragraph 1 of subsection C of this section
shall submit to the Commission an enrollment verification form from
the private school in which the eligible student is enrolled or is
expected to enroll with the tuition and fees to be charged the
taxpayer for the applicable school year. In reviewing applications
submitted by eligible taxpayers to determine whether they qualify
for a credit authorized by paragraph 1 of subsection C of this
section, the Commission shall give first preference in making
installments payments to taxpayers who qualify pursuant to
subparagraphs a and b of paragraph 1 of subsection C of this
section. The Commission shall give second preference in making
ENR. S. B. NO. 684 Page 9

payments to taxpayers who qualify and have received the credit in
the prior year. For credits issued in the 2025-2026 2026-2027
school year and subsequent school years, the application period
shall be open on February 15 March 15 through June 15 prior to the
beginning of each school year. For any eligible student whose
parents or legal guardians have a combined adjusted gross income
that does not exceed One Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars
($150,000.00) or qualified and received credit in the prior year,
applications shall be submitted to the Commission within the first
sixty (60) days of the opening of the application period to receive
priority consideration. For students enrolled in the full school
year, the full credit amount authorized for the school year shall be
paid in two installments, one per school semester, to be paid no
later than August 30 and January 15, each of which shall be half of
the total expected amount of tuition and fees on the enrollment
verification form submitted pursuant to this subsection.
F. In the event there are more applications submitted by
eligible taxpayers for a credit authorized by paragraph 1 of
subsection C of this section than available credits pursuant to
subsection D of this section, then the Commission shall give first
preference in authorizing credits for eligible students of taxpayers
who qualify pursuant to subparagraphs a and b of paragraph 1 of
subsection C of this section and have received the credit in the
prior year.
G. Taxpayers claiming the credit shall:
1. Only claim the credit for qualified expenses as defined in
paragraphs 6 7 and 7 8 of subsection A of this section to provide an
education for an eligible student;
2. Ensure no other person is claiming a credit for the eligible
student;
3. Not claim the credit for an eligible student who enrolls as
a full-time student in a public school district, public charter

participating in the Oklahoma Parental Choice Tax Credit Program.
I. H. 1. The Commission shall have the authority to conduct an
audit or contract for the auditing of receipts for qualified
expenses submitted pursuant to paragraph 2 of subsection C of this
section.
2. The Commission shall be authorized to recapture the credits
otherwise authorized by the provisions of the Oklahoma Parental
Choice Tax Credit Act on a prorated basis if an audit conducted
pursuant to this subsection shows that the credit was claimed for
expenditures that were not qualified expenses or it finds that the
taxpayer has claimed an eligible student who no longer attends a
private school or has enrolled in a public school in the state.
3. The Commission shall be authorized to reallocate credits for
the current application year to the next eligible taxpayer in line
when a taxpayer, on behalf of an eligible student in the program,
chooses not to participate, is no longer eligible to participate, or
chooses to forgo participation in the program for any reason no
later than September 1 following the opening of the application
period of each year.
