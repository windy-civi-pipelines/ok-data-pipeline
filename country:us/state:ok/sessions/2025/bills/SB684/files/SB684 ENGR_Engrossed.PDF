13 exceed the annual limit. The formula to be used for the percentage
14 adjustment shall be Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000.00) divided by
15 the amount of credit claimed in the second preceding tax year. In
16 the event the total tax credits authorized by this section exceed
17 the annual limit in any tax year, the Tax Commission shall permit
18 any excess but shall factor such excess into the percentage
19 adjustment formula for subsequent tax years.
20 3. If a taxpayer, on behalf of an eligible student in the

16 or she is a recipient of income-based government benefits including
17 the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Temporary
