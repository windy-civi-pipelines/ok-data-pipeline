15
information,
15
16
(12) include information that would materially
16
17
compromise an ongoing criminal investigation or
17
18
ongoing criminal prosecution, provided that:
18
19
(a) ten (10) days following the formal
19
20
arraignment or initial appearance, whichever
20
21
occurs first, of a person charged in the
21
22
case in question, the recording shall be
22
23
made available for public inspection and
23
24
copying with no redaction of the portions
24
Req. No. 346 Page 8
1
that were temporarily withheld by reliance
1
2
on this division. Provided, before
2
3
potential release of a recording as provided
3
4
for in this subdivision, the prosecutor or
4
5
legal representative of the person charged
5
6
may request from the appropriate district
6
7
court an extension of time during which the
7
8
recording may be withheld under the
8
9
provisions of this division. When a request
9
10
for an extension of time has been filed with
10
11
the court, the recording in question may be
11
12
withheld until the court has issued a
12
13
ruling. Such requests for an extension of
13
14
the time during which the recording may be
14
15
withheld may be made on the grounds that
15
16
release of the recording will materially
16
17
compromise an ongoing criminal investigation
17
18
or criminal prosecution or on the grounds
18
19
that release of the recording will
19
20
materially compromise the right of an
20
21
accused to a fair trial that has yet to
21
22
begin. Courts considering such requests
22
23
shall conduct a hearing and consider whether
23
24
the interests of the public outweigh the
24
Req. No. 346 Page 9
1
interests asserted by the parties. In
1
2
response to such requests, the court shall
2
3
order that the recording be made available
3
4
for public inspection and copying with no
4
5
redaction of the portions that were
5
6
temporarily withheld by reliance on this
6
7
division or order an extension of time
7
8
during which the recording may be withheld
8
9
under the provisions of this division.
9
10
Provided further, each such time extension
10
11
shall only be ordered by the court for an
11
12
additional six-month period of time or less
12
13
and cumulative time extensions shall not add
13
14
up to more than eighteen (18) months, or
14
15
(b) in the event that one hundred twenty (120)
15
16
days expire from the date of the events
16
17
depicted in the recording without any person
17
18
being criminally charged in the case in
18
19
question and release of a recording or
19
20
portions of a recording have been denied on
20
21
the grounds provided for in this division,
21
22
an appeal of such denial may be made to the
22
23
appropriate district court. In situations
23
24
where one hundred twenty (120) days have
24
Req. No. 346 Page 10
1
expired since the creation of the recording,
1
2
criminal charges have not been filed against
2
3
a person and the recording is being withheld
3
4
on the grounds provided for in this
4
5
division, courts considering appeals to the
5
6
use of the provisions of this division for
6
7
temporarily withholding a recording shall
7
8
conduct a hearing and consider whether the
8
9
interests of the public outweigh the
9
10
interests of the parties protected by this
10
11
division. In response to such appeals, the
11
12
district court shall order that the
12
13
recording be made available for public
13
14
inspection and copying with no redaction of
14
15
the portions that were temporarily withheld
15
16
by reliance on this division or order an
16
17
extension of time during which the recording
17
18
may be withheld under the provisions of this
18
19
division. An order granting an extension of
19
20
time shall be applicable to the recording
20
21
against all appellants for the duration of
21
22
the extension. Provided, each such time
22
23
extension shall only be ordered by the
23
24
district court for an additional twelve-
24
Req. No. 346 Page 11
1
month period of time or less and cumulative
1
2
time extensions shall not add up to more
2
3
than three (3) years. Provided, charges
3
4
being filed against a person in the case in
4
5
question automatically cancels any extension
5
6
of time. A new request for an extension of
6
7
time following an arraignment or initial
7
8
appearance may be requested by the parties
8
9
on the grounds and under the terms provided
9
10
for in subdivision (a) of this division.
10
11
The options presented in this division to
11
12
potentially withhold a recording or portions of a
12
13
recording on the grounds provided for in this
13
14
division shall expire in totality four (4) years
14
15
after the recording was made at which time all
15
16
recordings previously withheld on the grounds
16
17
provided for in this division shall be made
17
18
available for public inspection and copying, or
18
19
(13) reveal the identity of law enforcement officers
19
20
who have become subject to internal investigation
20
21
by the law enforcement agency as a result of an
21
22
event depicted in the recording. The option to
22
23
protect the identity of a law enforcement officer
23
24
shall not be available to the law enforcement
24
Req. No. 346 Page 12
1
agency after the law enforcement agency has
1
2
concluded the investigation and rendered a
2
3
decision as to final disciplinary action. At
3
4
such time when an investigation has concluded and
4
5
the law enforcement agency has rendered its
5
6
decision as to final disciplinary action, the
6
7
portions of the recordings previously withheld as
7
8
provided for in this division shall be available
8
9
for public inspection and copying. The audio and
9
10
video recordings withheld on the grounds provided
10
11
for in this division shall be available for
11
12
public inspection and copying before the
12
13
conclusion of the investigation if the
13
14
investigation lasts for an unreasonable amount of
14
15
time.
15
16
B. 1. Except for the records listed in subsection A of this
16
17

Section 17:
section and those made open by other state or local laws, law
17
18
enforcement agencies may deny access to law enforcement records
18
19
except where a court finds that the public interest or the interest
19
20
of an individual outweighs the reason for denial. The provisions of
20
21
this section shall not operate to deny access to law enforcement
21
22
records if such records have been previously made available to the
22
23
public as provided in the Oklahoma Open Records Act or as otherwise
23
24
provided by law.
24
Req. No. 346 Page 13

of his or her official duties including any related
4
5
acts or events immediately preceding or subsequent to
5
6
the acts or events that caused or otherwise relate to
6
7
the death, except where a court finds that the public
7
8
interest or the interest of an individual outweighs
8
9
the reason for denial. Provided, however, a law
9
10
enforcement agency may allow a family member of the
10
11
deceased law enforcement officer to hear or view such
11
12
audio or video recording under protocols established

20
or the use of such recordings as evidence in a legal
20
21
proceeding.
21
22
C. Nothing contained in this section imposes any new
22
23
recordkeeping requirements. Law enforcement records shall be kept
23
24
for as long as is now or may hereafter be specified by law. Absent
24
Req. No. 346 Page 14
1
a legal requirement for the keeping of a law enforcement record for

a specific time period, law enforcement agencies shall maintain

(a) ten (10) days following the formal
19
20
arraignment or initial appearance, whichever
20
21
occurs first, of a person charged in the

24
copying with no redaction of the portions
24
Req. No. 346 Page 8

that were temporarily withheld by reliance
1

on this division. Provided, before
2
3
potential release of a recording as provided
3
4
for in this subdivision, the prosecutor or
4
5
legal representative of the person charged
5
6
may request from the appropriate district
6
7
court an extension of time during which the
7
8
recording may be withheld under the
8
9
provisions of this division. When a request
9
10
for an extension of time has been filed with
10
11
the court, the recording in question may be
11
12
withheld until the court has issued a
12
13
ruling. Such requests for an extension of
13
14
the time during which the recording may be
14
15
withheld may be made on the grounds that
15
16
release of the recording will materially
16
17
compromise an ongoing criminal investigation
17
18
or criminal prosecution or on the grounds
18
19
that release of the recording will
19
20
materially compromise the right of an
20
21
accused to a fair trial that has yet to
21
22
begin. Courts considering such requests
22
23
shall conduct a hearing and consider whether
23
24
the interests of the public outweigh the
24
Req. No. 346 Page 9

1
interests asserted by the parties. In
1
2
response to such requests, the court shall
2
3
order that the recording be made available
3
4
for public inspection and copying with no
4
5
redaction of the portions that were
5
6
temporarily withheld by reliance on this
6
7
division or order an extension of time
7
8
during which the recording may be withheld
8
9
under the provisions of this division.
9
10
Provided further, each such time extension
10
11
shall only be ordered by the court for an
11
12
additional six-month period of time or less
12
13
and cumulative time extensions shall not add
13
14
up to more than eighteen (18) months, or
14
15
(b) in the event that one hundred twenty (120)
15
16
days expire from the date of the events
16
17
depicted in the recording without any person
17
18
being criminally charged in the case in
18
19
question and release of a recording or
19
20
portions of a recording have been denied on
20
21
the grounds provided for in this division,
21
22
an appeal of such denial may be made to the
22
23
appropriate district court. In situations
23
24
where one hundred twenty (120) days have
24
Req. No. 346 Page 10

1
expired since the creation of the recording,
1
2
criminal charges have not been filed against
2
3
a person and the recording is being withheld
3
4
on the grounds provided for in this
4
5
division, courts considering appeals to the
5
6
use of the provisions of this division for
6
7
temporarily withholding a recording shall
7
8
conduct a hearing and consider whether the
8
9
interests of the public outweigh the
9
10
interests of the parties protected by this
10
11
division. In response to such appeals, the
11
12
district court shall order that the
12
13
recording be made available for public
13
14
inspection and copying with no redaction of
14
15
the portions that were temporarily withheld
15
16
by reliance on this division or order an
16
17
extension of time during which the recording
17
18
may be withheld under the provisions of this
18
19
division. An order granting an extension of
19
20
time shall be applicable to the recording
20
21
against all appellants for the duration of
21
22
the extension. Provided, each such time
22
23
extension shall only be ordered by the
23
24
district court for an additional twelve-
24
Req. No. 346 Page 11

1
month period of time or less and cumulative
1
2
time extensions shall not add up to more
2
3
than three (3) years. Provided, charges
3
4
being filed against a person in the case in
4
5
question automatically cancels any extension
5
6
of time. A new request for an extension of
6
7
time following an arraignment or initial
7
8
appearance may be requested by the parties
8
9
on the grounds and under the terms provided
9
10
for in subdivision (a) of this division.
10
11
The options presented in this division to
11
12
potentially withhold a recording or portions of a
12
13
recording on the grounds provided for in this
13
14
division shall expire in totality four (4) years
14
15
after the recording was made at which time all
15
16
recordings previously withheld on the grounds
16
17
provided for in this division shall be made
17
18
available for public inspection and copying, or
18
19
(13) reveal the identity of law enforcement officers
19
20
who have become subject to internal investigation
20
21
by the law enforcement agency as a result of an
21
22
event depicted in the recording. The option to
22
23
protect the identity of a law enforcement officer
23
24
shall not be available to the law enforcement
24
Req. No. 346 Page 12

1
agency after the law enforcement agency has
1
2
concluded the investigation and rendered a
2
3
decision as to final disciplinary action. At
3
4
such time when an investigation has concluded and
4
5
the law enforcement agency has rendered its
5
6
decision as to final disciplinary action, the
6
7
portions of the recordings previously withheld as
7
8
provided for in this division shall be available
8
9
for public inspection and copying. The audio and
9
10
video recordings withheld on the grounds provided
10
11
for in this division shall be available for
11
12
public inspection and copying before the
12
13
conclusion of the investigation if the
13
14
investigation lasts for an unreasonable amount of
14
15
time.
15
16
B. 1. Except for the records listed in subsection A of this
16
17
section and those made open by other state or local laws, law
17
18
enforcement agencies may deny access to law enforcement records
18
19
except where a court finds that the public interest or the interest
19
20
of an individual outweighs the reason for denial. The provisions of
20
21
this section shall not operate to deny access to law enforcement
21
22
records if such records have been previously made available to the
22
23
public as provided in the Oklahoma Open Records Act or as otherwise
23
24
provided by law.

4
5
acts or events immediately preceding or subsequent to
5
6
the acts or events that caused or otherwise relate to
6

interest or the interest of an individual outweighs
8

10
11
deceased law enforcement officer to hear or view such
11

21
proceeding.
