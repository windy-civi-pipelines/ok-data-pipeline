12 (12) include information that would materially
13 compromise an ongoing criminal investigation or
14 ongoing criminal prosecution, provided that:
15 (a) ten (10) days following the formal
16 arraignment or initial appearance, whichever
17 occurs first, of a person charged in the
18 case in question, the recording shall be
19 made available for public inspection and
20 copying with no redaction of the portions
21 that were temporarily withheld by reliance
22 on this division. Provided, before
23 potential release of a recording as provided
24 for in this subdivision, the prosecutor or
SENATE FLOOR VERSION - SB596 SFLR Page 8
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)

1 legal representative of the person charged
2 may request from the appropriate district
3 court an extension of time during which the
4 recording may be withheld under the
5 provisions of this division. When a request
6 for an extension of time has been filed with
7 the court, the recording in question may be
8 withheld until the court has issued a
9 ruling. Such requests for an extension of
10 the time during which the recording may be
11 withheld may be made on the grounds that
12 release of the recording will materially
13 compromise an ongoing criminal investigation
14 or criminal prosecution or on the grounds
15 that release of the recording will
16 materially compromise the right of an
17 accused to a fair trial that has yet to
18 begin. Courts considering such requests
19 shall conduct a hearing and consider whether
20 the interests of the public outweigh the
21 interests asserted by the parties. In
22 response to such requests, the court shall
23 order that the recording be made available
24 for public inspection and copying with no
SENATE FLOOR VERSION - SB596 SFLR Page 9
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)

1 redaction of the portions that were
2 temporarily withheld by reliance on this
3 division or order an extension of time
4 during which the recording may be withheld
5 under the provisions of this division.
6 Provided further, each such time extension
7 shall only be ordered by the court for an
8 additional six-month period of time or less
9 and cumulative time extensions shall not add
10 up to more than eighteen (18) months, or
11 (b) in the event that one hundred twenty (120)
12 days expire from the date of the events
13 depicted in the recording without any person
14 being criminally charged in the case in
15 question and release of a recording or
16 portions of a recording have been denied on
17 the grounds provided for in this division,
18 an appeal of such denial may be made to the
19 appropriate district court. In situations
20 where one hundred twenty (120) days have
21 expired since the creation of the recording,
22 criminal charges have not been filed against
23 a person and the recording is being withheld
24 on the grounds provided for in this
SENATE FLOOR VERSION - SB596 SFLR Page 10
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)

1 division, courts considering appeals to the
2 use of the provisions of this division for
3 temporarily withholding a recording shall
4 conduct a hearing and consider whether the
5 interests of the public outweigh the
6 interests of the parties protected by this
7 division. In response to such appeals, the
8 district court shall order that the
9 recording be made available for public
10 inspection and copying with no redaction of
11 the portions that were temporarily withheld
12 by reliance on this division or order an
13 extension of time during which the recording
14 may be withheld under the provisions of this
15 division. An order granting an extension of
16 time shall be applicable to the recording
17 against all appellants for the duration of
18 the extension. Provided, each such time
19 extension shall only be ordered by the
20 district court for an additional twelve-
21 month period of time or less and cumulative
22 time extensions shall not add up to more
23 than three (3) years. Provided, charges
24 being filed against a person in the case in
SENATE FLOOR VERSION - SB596 SFLR Page 11
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)

1 question automatically cancels any extension
2 of time. A new request for an extension of
3 time following an arraignment or initial
4 appearance may be requested by the parties
5 on the grounds and under the terms provided
6 for in subdivision (a) of this division.
7 The options presented in this division to
8 potentially withhold a recording or portions of a
9 recording on the grounds provided for in this
10 division shall expire in totality four (4) years
11 after the recording was made at which time all
12 recordings previously withheld on the grounds
13 provided for in this division shall be made
14 available for public inspection and copying, or
15 (13) reveal the identity of law enforcement officers
16 who have become subject to internal investigation
17 by the law enforcement agency as a result of an
18 event depicted in the recording. The option to
19 protect the identity of a law enforcement officer
20 shall not be available to the law enforcement
21 agency after the law enforcement agency has
22 concluded the investigation and rendered a
23 decision as to final disciplinary action. At
24 such time when an investigation has concluded and
SENATE FLOOR VERSION - SB596 SFLR Page 12
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)

1 the law enforcement agency has rendered its
2 decision as to final disciplinary action, the
3 portions of the recordings previously withheld as
4 provided for in this division shall be available
5 for public inspection and copying. The audio and
6 video recordings withheld on the grounds provided
7 for in this division shall be available for
8 public inspection and copying before the
9 conclusion of the investigation if the
10 investigation lasts for an unreasonable amount of
11 time.
12 B. 1. Except for the records listed in subsection A of this
13 section and those made open by other state or local laws, law
14 enforcement agencies may deny access to law enforcement records
15 except where a court finds that the public interest or the interest
16 of an individual outweighs the reason for denial. The provisions of
17 this section shall not operate to deny access to law enforcement
18 records if such records have been previously made available to the
19 public as provided in the Oklahoma Open Records Act or as otherwise
20 provided by law.
21 2. a. A law enforcement agency shall deny access to any
22 audio or video recording that depicts the death of a
23 law enforcement officer who was acting in the course
24 of his or her official duties including any related
SENATE FLOOR VERSION - SB596 SFLR Page 13
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)

1 acts or events immediately preceding or subsequent to
2 the acts or events that caused or otherwise relate to
3 the death, except where a court finds that the public
4 interest or the interest of an individual outweighs
5 the reason for denial. Provided, however, a law
6 enforcement agency may allow a family member of the
7 deceased law enforcement officer to hear or view such
8 audio or video recording under protocols established
9 by the law enforcement agency. For the purposes of
10 this subparagraph, “family member” means a spouse,
11 adult child, parent or sibling of the deceased law
12 enforcement officer.
13 b. Nothing in subparagraph a of this paragraph shall be
14 construed to prohibit the prosecution and defense
15 counsel from access to such audio or video recordings
16 or the use of such recordings as evidence in a legal
17 proceeding.
18 C. Nothing contained in this section imposes any new
19 recordkeeping requirements. Law enforcement records shall be kept
20 for as long as is now or may hereafter be specified by law. Absent
21 a legal requirement for the keeping of a law enforcement record for
22 a specific time period, law enforcement agencies shall maintain
23 their records for so long as needed for administrative purposes.

18 guidelines on asset distribution and use said the guidelines as a
19 basis for establishing guidelines for this state. The Attorney
