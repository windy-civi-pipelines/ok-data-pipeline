follows:
Section 1151.30. A. A residential or commercial roofing
contractor providing repairs or improvement services to be paid by
an insured from the proceeds of a property or casualty insurance
policy shall not, as an inducement to the sale or provision of goods
or services to an insured, advertise or promise to pay, directly or
indirectly, all or part of any applicable insurance deductible or
offer to compensate an insured for providing any service to the
insured. If a roofing contractor violates the provisions of this

estimate. The adjuster or insurer shall provide a written
notification of the requirements of this section in the initial
estimate relating to the claim.

the registrar alleging a violation of this section. The complaint
shall be on a form approved by the registrar and shall set forth the
alleged act or omission provided in subsection A of this section,
and a statement of sufficient facts upon which a reasonable person
could conclude that the act or omission specified in subsection A of
this section has been committed. All complaints filed with the
registrar shall be open to public inspection. Nothing in this
section shall be construed to require the complainant to first file
a complaint with the registrar before seeking relief or remedies
allowed by law.
C. 1. The registrar shall forward all complaints alleging
violations of this section to the Insurance Department and the
Office of the Attorney General for investigation, enforcement, and
prosecution of any alleged violation.
2. A complaint received by the registrar pursuant to this
section shall be referred to the district attorney for appropriate
disposition as determined by the district attorney in his or her
discretion.
