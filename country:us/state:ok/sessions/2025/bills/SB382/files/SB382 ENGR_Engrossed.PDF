6 district during the preceding year has been paid to the receiving
7 district in advance yearly or by semester as determined by the
8 district board of education of the receiving district. If the State
9 Board of Education discovers that the attendance has been allowed
10 without prior payment of the tuition fee in advance as required, no
11 further payment of any State Aid funds shall be made to the district
12 until the district has shown to the satisfaction of the State Board
13 of Education that all tuition fees have been paid or that the pupil
14 will no longer be allowed to attend school until the required
15 tuition fee has been paid.
16 2. The provisions of paragraph 1 of this subsection shall not
17 apply to a school district that enrolls nonresident students from a
18 contiguous, out-of-state school district if the district:

21 124 of this title, that is above the state average
22 per-pupil expenditure.

3 allocated or transferred to the receiving school district.

5 care and custody of a child who pays ad valorem tax on real property
6 in any other school district other than that in which that person
7 resides may, with the approval of the receiving school district,
8 enroll the child in any school district in which ad valorem tax is
9 paid and receive a credit on the nonresident tuition fee equal to
10 the amount of the ad valorem tax paid for school district purposes
11 in the school district in which the child is enrolled. Provided,
12 the credit shall not exceed the total amount required for the
13 tuition payment.
14 SECTION 2. This act shall become effective July 1, 2025.
15 SECTION 3. It being immediately necessary for the preservation
16 of the public peace, health, or safety, an emergency is hereby
17 declared to exist, by reason whereof this act shall take effect and
18 be in full force from and after its passage and approval.
