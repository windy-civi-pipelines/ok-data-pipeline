8 district during the preceding year has been paid to the receiving
9 district in advance yearly or by semester as determined by the
10 district board of education of the receiving district. If the State
11 Board of Education discovers that the attendance has been allowed
12 without prior payment of the tuition fee in advance as required, no
13 further payment of any State Aid funds shall be made to the district
14 until the district has shown to the satisfaction of the State Board
15 of Education that all tuition fees have been paid or that the pupil
16 will no longer be allowed to attend school until the required
17 tuition fee has been paid.
18 2. The provisions of paragraph 1 of this subsection shall not

15 tuition payment.
