Req. No. 13452 Page 1

1 Section 1-114. A. All Except as provided for in subsection D
2 of this section, all children between the ages of five (5) years on
3 or before September 1 and twenty-one (21) years on or before
4 September 1 shall be entitled to attend school free of charge in the
5 district in which they reside.
6 B. All Except as provided for in subsection D of this section,
7 all children who are at least four (4) years of age but not more
8 than five (5) years of age on or before September 1 and who have not
9 attended a public school kindergarten shall be entitled to attend
10 half-day or full-day early childhood programs at any public school
11 in the state where such programs are offered; provided, no child
12 shall be required to attend any early childhood education program.
13 The following paragraphs shall govern early childhood programs:
14 1. Children Except as provided for in subsection D of this
15 section, children who are at least four (4) years of age but not
16 more than five (5) years of age on or before September 1 shall be
17 entitled to attend either half-day or full-day early childhood
18 programs in their district of residence free of charge as long as
19 the district has the physical facilities and teaching personnel to

21 children in an early childhood education program shall be included
22 in the average daily membership of the district providing the
23 program;
24
Req. No. 13452 Page 2

1 2. A Except as provided for in subsection D of this section, a
2 child who has not reached the age of five (5) years on or before
3 September 1 and who resides in a district which does not offer an
4 early childhood program shall be eligible for transfer to a district
5 where an early childhood program is offered if the district that
6 offers the early childhood program has the capacity to accept the
7 child as provided for in the Education Open Transfer Act. A
8 district offering early childhood programs may refuse to accept a
9 nonresident child if the district does not have the capacity to
10 accommodate the child in an early childhood education class, as
11 provided for in the Education Open Transfer Act. If the child
12 requesting the transfer has not reached the age of four (4) years on
13 or before September 1, the district may refuse to accept the
14 nonresident child if the district determines the child is not ready
15 for an early childhood program. Children who are accepted in a
16 program outside their district of residence as provided in this
17 paragraph shall be included in the average daily membership of the
18 district providing the program for State Aid funding subject to the
19 State Aid formula weight limitations set forth in paragraph 1 of
20 this subsection; and
21 3. The State Board of Education shall promulgate rules that
22 create exemptions relating to the maximum age at which a child may
23 attend half-day or full-day early childhood programs.

Req. No. 13452 Page 3

1 C. No child shall be enrolled in kindergarten unless he or she
2 will have reached the age of five (5) years on or before September 1
3 of the school year. No child shall be enrolled in the first grade
4 unless he or she will have reached the age of six (6) years on or
5 before September 1 of the school year.
6 D. 1. Beginning with the 2025-2026 school year, a child shall
7 be toilet trained prior to enrolling in prekindergarten. Upon
8 enrolling a child in the district in which he or she resides or
9 enrolling a child in a district to which he or she transferred in
10 accordance with the Education Open Transfer Act, a parent or legal
11 guardian of the child shall provide assurances that the child is
12 toilet trained on a form prescribed by the State Department of
13 Education.
14 2. The State Department of Education shall create a process for
15 school districts to follow upon determining that a student who
16 enrolls in prekindergarten is not toilet trained. For the purposes
17 of this section, “not toilet trained” means three or more documented
18 incidents of the child soiling or urinating himself or herself over
19 a four-week period. The process shall allow for a school district
20 to:
21 a. temporarily withdraw a child until he or she has been
22 toilet trained and provide for reintegration of the
23 child once he or she is toilet trained,
24
Req. No. 13452 Page 4

1 b. refer the child’s parents or legal guardians to family
2 supports and resources to aid in toilet training, and
3 c. allow a parent or legal guardian or his or her
4 designee to aid in toilet training as needed.
5 3. A student who is unable to be toilet trained or whose toilet
6 training is delayed due to a disability that would be recognized by
7 an individualized education program (IEP) in accordance with the
8 Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) or a Section 504
9 Plan in accordance with the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 prior to
10 enrolling in prekindergarten shall be exempt from the provisions of
11 this subsection.
12 E. 1. No nonresident and nontransferred pupil shall be allowed
13 to attend school in any school district unless a tuition fee equal
14 to the per capita cost of education for a similar period in such
15 district during the preceding year has been paid to the receiving
16 district in advance yearly or by semester as determined by the
17 district board of education of the receiving district. If the State
18 Board of Education discovers that the attendance has been allowed
19 without prior payment of the tuition fee in advance as required, no
20 further payment of any State Aid funds shall be made to the district
21 until the district has shown to the satisfaction of the State Board
22 of Education that all tuition fees have been paid or that the pupil
23 will no longer be allowed to attend school until the required
24 tuition fee has been paid.
Req. No. 13452 Page 5

1 2. The provisions of paragraph 1 of this subsection shall not
2 apply to a school district that enrolls nonresident students from a
3 contiguous, out-of-state school district if the district:
4 a. does not receive payment of any State Aid funds, and
5 b. has a per-pupil expenditure, as defined by Section 1-
6 124 of this title, that is above the state average
7 per-pupil expenditure.
8 A nonresident student whose resident district, as determined by
9 Section 1-113 of this title, is not within this state shall not be
10 eligible for State Aid. No local funding associated with the
11 nonresident student’s out-of-state resident district shall be
12 allocated or transferred to the receiving school district.
13 E. F. Any parent, legal guardian, person, or institution having
14 care and custody of a child who pays ad valorem tax on real property
15 in any other school district other than that in which that person
16 resides may, with the approval of the receiving school district,
17 enroll the child in any school district in which ad valorem tax is
18 paid and receive a credit on the nonresident tuition fee equal to
19 the amount of the ad valorem tax paid for school district purposes
20 in the school district in which the child is enrolled. Provided,
21 the credit shall not exceed the total amount required for the
22 tuition payment.
23 SECTION 2. This act shall become effective July 1, 2025.
24
Req. No. 13452 Page 6
