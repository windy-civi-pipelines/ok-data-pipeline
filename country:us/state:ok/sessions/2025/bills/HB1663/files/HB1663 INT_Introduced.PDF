14 auction to the highest bidder for cash or certified funds. Online

Req. No. 10521 Page 5

1 C. All property must be sold for a sum not less than two-thirds
2 (2/3) of the assessed value of such real estate as fixed for the
3 current fiscal year, or for the total amount of taxes, penalties,
4 interest and costs due on such property, whichever is the lesser.
5 Notwithstanding, there shall be a reserve minimum bid placed in an
6 amount covering all taxes, abatement costs, penalties, interest,
7 costs due to a municipality if the right to exercise the reserve
8 minimum bid is noticed to the county treasurer. With the exception
9 of nuisance property, if there is no bid equal to or greater than
10 the sum so required, the county treasurer shall bid off the same in
11 the name of the county. However, the property must be bid off in
12 the name of the municipality if demand is made in writing by a
13 municipality which has outstanding liens upon the property. In
14 cases of nuisance property, the county treasurer shall have
15 discretion to not bid off the property in the name of the county and
16 instead allow the property to remain under its current ownership,
17 unless demand is made in writing by a municipality which has
18 outstanding liens upon the property. "Nuisance property" shall be
19 defined as property that is deemed unmarketable or unusable due to
20 the existence of liens in excess of the property's fair market value
21 as shown by the county assessor's office or due to environmental
22 problems or conditions that exist on the property that would cost
23 more to remedy than the fair market value of the property as shown
24 by the county assessor's office, or property in which abatement
Req. No. 10521 Page 6

1 lien s have been placed upon the property by a municipality in excess
2 of twenty-five percent (25%) of the property's fair market value as
3 shown by the county assessor's office. Greenbelts, common areas,
4 easements, retention ponds and detention ponds may also be
5 considered nuisance property if transference of ownership to either
6 the county or a third party would cause a hardship to the
7 neighborhood or subdivision these areas were meant to serve or to
8 the county or third party. The county treasurer shall make the
9 determination, in conjunction with review and approval of the board
10 of county commissioners, upon consideration of the above factors, as
11 to whether or not property constitutes nuisance property. The said
12 nuisance property determination may be made at any time during the
13 year, including before or immediately after the June resale. In the
14 case of a nuisance property that has liens from a city or town, if a
15 minimum bid is not made, the city or town shall be credited a bid on
16 the property equal to the amount of the lien of the city or town if
17 its intention to do so is made known to the county treasurer prior
18 to the sale or at the sale. In the case of a nuisance property with
19 liens from a city or town, if a minimum bid is not made, the
20 nuisance property shall be bid off in the name of the city or town
21 if its intention to do so is made known to the county treasurer
22 prior to the sale or at the sale. All property bid off in the name
23 of the county shall be for the amount of all taxes, penalties,
24 interest and costs due thereon, and the county treasurer shall issue
Req. No. 10521 Page 7

1 a de ed therefor to the board of county commissioners for the use and
2 benefit of the county. All nuisance property bid off in the name of
3 the city or town shall be for the amount of any municipal liens due
4 thereon, and the county treasurer shall issue a deed therefor to the
5 city or town for the use and benefit of the city or town.
6 C. The county treasurers shall provide to the Oklahoma Health
7 Care Authority (OHCA) a list of properties that will be sold at tax
8 resales in their respective counties. Using the information
9 provided, the OHCA shall produce a list for each county of
10 properties on which the OHCA has liens. The county treasurers shall
11 make the list of properties with the OHCA liens available to
12 potential buyers at the tax resales. The OHCA shall file a release
13 of the liens on properties that fit the definition of blighted
14 properties, as defined in Section 38-101 of Title 11 of the Oklahoma
15 Statutes, in the county records of the county where the property is
16 located upon request of that county's treasurer. The filing of the
17 lien release shall not extinguish the debt owed to the OHCA which
18 may be enforced through any legal means available to the OHCA.
19 D. The county shall not be liable to the state or any taxing
20 district thereof for any part of the amount for which any property
21 may be sold to such county. All property bid off in the name of the
22 county shall be exempt from ad valorem taxation as long as title is
23 held for the county.
24
Req. No. 10521 Page 8

1 E. 1. The county shall not be civilly liable for any
2 environmental problems or conditions on any property which existed
3 on the property prior to the county's involuntary ownership of the
4 property pursuant to this section, or which may result from such
5 environmental problems or conditions on the property. During the
6 period of the county's involuntary ownership of the property, the
7 person or persons who would be legally liable for the environmental
8 problems or conditions on the property but for the county's
9 ownership shall continue to be liable for such environmental
10 problems or conditions.
11 2. In addition, the county shall not be subject to civil
12 liability with regard to any actions taken by the county to
13 remediate any problems or conditions on the property resulting from
14 the environmental problems or conditions if the remedial action is
15 not performed in a reckless or negligent manner.
16 SECTION 5. This act shall become effective November 1, 2025.
