7 Notwithstanding, there shall be a reserve minimum bid placed in an
8 amount covering all taxes, abatement costs, penalties, interest,
9 costs due to a municipality if the right to exercise the reserve
10 minimum bid is noticed to the county treasurer. With the exception

21 defined as property that is deemed unmarketable or unusable due to

4 of twenty-five percent (25%) of the property's fair market value as
5 shown by the county assessor's office. Greenbelts, common areas,
6 easements, retention ponds and detention ponds may also be
7 considered nuisance property if transference of ownership to either
8 the county or a third party would cause a hardship to the
9 neighborhood or subdivision these areas were meant to serve or to

11 determination, in conjunction with review and approval of the board
12 of county commissioners, upon consideration of the above factors, as
13 to whether or not property constitutes nuisance property. The said
14 nuisance property determination may be made at any time during the
15 year, including before or immediately after the June resale. In the
16 case of a nuisance property that has liens from a city or town, if a
17 minimum bid is not made, the city or town shall be credited a bid on
18 the property equal to the amount of the lien of the city or town if
19 its intention to do so is made known to the county treasurer prior
20 to the sale or at the sale. In the case of a nuisance property with
21 liens from a city or town, if a minimum bid is not made, the
22 nuisance property shall be bid off in the name of the city or town
23 if its intention to do so is made known to the county treasurer

5 the city or town shall be for the amount of any municipal liens due
6 thereon, and the county treasurer shall issue a deed therefor to the
7 city or town for the use and benefit of the city or town.
8 C. D. The county treasurers shall provide to the Oklahoma
9 Health Care Authority (OHCA) a list of properties that will be sold
10 at tax resales in their respective counties. Using the information
11 provided, the OHCA shall produce a list for each county of
12 properties on which the OHCA has liens. The county treasurers shall
13 make the list of properties with the OHCA liens available to
14 potential buyers at the tax resales. The OHCA shall file a release
15 of the liens on properties that fit the definition of blighted
16 properties, as defined in Section 38-101 of Title 11 of the Oklahoma
17 Statutes, in the county records of the county where the property is
18 located upon request of that county's treasurer. The filing of the
19 lien release shall not extinguish the debt owed to the OHCA which
20 may be enforced through any legal means available to the OHCA.
21 D. E. The county shall not be liable to the state or any taxing
22 district thereof for any part of the amount for which any property
23 may be sold to such county. All property bid off in the name of the

4 environmental problems or conditions on any property which existed
5 on the property prior to the county's involuntary ownership of the
6 property pursuant to this section, or which may result from such
7 environmental problems or conditions on the property. During the
8 period of the county's involuntary ownership of the property, the
9 person or persons who would be legally liable for the environmental
10 problems or conditions on the property but for the county's
11 ownership shall continue to be liable for such environmental
12 problems or conditions.
13 2. In addition, the county shall not be subject to civil
14 liability with regard to any actions taken by the county to
15 remediate any problems or conditions on the property resulting from
16 the environmental problems or conditions if the remedial action is
17 not performed in a reckless or negligent manner.
18 SECTION 5. This act shall become effective November 1, 2025.
