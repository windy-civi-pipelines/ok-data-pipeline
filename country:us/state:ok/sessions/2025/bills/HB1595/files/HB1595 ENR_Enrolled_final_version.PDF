The court may suspend sentencing of the defendant
until the defendant has presented proof to the court

domestic abuse treatment program certified by the
Attorney General and attendance at weekly sessions of
such program. Such proof shall be presented to the
court by the defendant no later than one hundred
ENR. H. B. NO. 1595 Page 4

such counseling or treatment. At such time, the court
may complete sentencing, beginning the period of the
sentence from the date that proof of enrollment is
presented to the court, and schedule reviews as
required by subparagraphs a and b of this paragraph
and paragraphs 4 and 5 of this subsection. Three
unexcused absences in succession or seven unexcused
absences in a period of fifty-two (52) weeks from any
court-ordered domestic abuse counseling or treatment
program shall be prima facie evidence of the violation
of the conditions of probation for the district
attorney to seek acceleration or revocation of any
probation entered by the court.
b. The court shall set a second review hearing after the
completion of the counseling or treatment to assure
the attendance and compliance of the defendant with

counseling or treatment program or is not in compliance with any

other necessary services. The court may revoke all or any part of a
suspended sentence, deferred sentence, or probation pursuant to
Section 991b of Title 22 of the Oklahoma Statutes and subject the
defendant to any or all remaining portions of the original sentence;

the same manner and procedure as set forth in Sections 1-8-103 and
