A. There is hereby created in the State Treasury a fund to be
1
2
known and designated as the “Oklahoma School Districts Carryover
2
3
Investment Fund”. The fund shall be a continuing fund, not subject
3
4
to fiscal year limitations, and shall consist of individual accounts
4
5
for each school district electing to invest carryover from the
5
6
general fund of the school district, as defined in Section 1-117 of
6
7
Title 70 of the Oklahoma Statutes.
7
8
B. The State Treasurer shall appoint qualified investment
8
9
managers to provide for the investment of the monies of the fund.
9
10
The investments shall be consistent with the manner in which state
10
11
retirement funds are invested. The risk of large losses shall be
11
12
minimized by diversifying the investments in the fund, unless, under
12
13
the circumstances, it is clearly prudent not to do so, which shall
13
14
include the length of time of the investment. The investment
14
15
managers may sell investments and realize losses if such action is
15
16
considered advantageous to longer-term return maximization.
16
17
C. Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, income and
17
18
investment return on the principal of each individual account shall
18
19
accrue to such account.
19
20
D. For each fiscal year, the State Treasurer shall
20
21
electronically submit a report to each school district for which an
21
22
individual account is created pursuant to subsection A of this
22
23

Section 3:
section detailing the present value of the investments and assets in
23
24
the account and the increase in value from the previous fiscal year.

2
individual account is created may elect to make a deposit or
2
3
withdrawal from the fund; provided, the district shall provide
3
4
notification to the State Treasurer of the intention to make a
4

9
10
in the Oklahoma School Districts Carryover Investment Fund in order
10
11
to facilitate any expected withdrawals pursuant to subsection E of
11
12
this section. In the event the balance of the Oklahoma School
12
13
Districts Carryover Investment Fund is insufficient or the cash
13
14
available in the fund is insufficient due to lack of liquid assets
14
15
to make the withdrawals requested pursuant to subsection E of this
15
16

year, the adjusted assessed valuation of the preceding year, and the
1
2
weighted average daily membership for the school district of the
2
3
preceding school year. Each school district shall submit the
3
4
following data based on the first nine (9) weeks, to be used in the
4
5
calculation of the average daily membership of the school district:

the State Aid Formula pursuant to subsection D of this section by
15
16
December 1 and by January 15 shall notify each school district of

20
21
Except for reductions made due to the assessment of penalties by the
21
22
State Department of Education according to law, the January payment
22

18
19
average per pupil revenue of all districts shall receive any State
19
20
Aid or Supplement in State Aid.
20
21
The July calculation of per pupil revenue shall be determined by
21
22
dividing the district’s second preceding year’s total weighted
22
23
average daily membership (ADM) into the district’s preceding year’s
23
24
total revenues excluding federal revenue, insurance loss payments,
24

preceding school year of a school district, as
20
21

7
8
error, or a successful tax protest, and the amount of such taxes
8
9
deemed uncollectible exceeds Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000.00) or
9
10
an amount greater than twenty-five percent (25%) of ad valorem taxes
10
11
per tax year, or the valuation of a district is lowered by order of

the State Board of Equalization, the school district’s State Aid,
12
13
for the school year that such ad valorem taxes are calculated in the
13
14
State Aid Formula, shall be determined by subtracting the net
14
15
assessed valuation of the property upon which taxes were deemed
15
16
uncollectible from the assessed valuation of the school district and
16
17
the state. Upon request of the local board of education, it shall
17
18
be the duty of the county assessor to certify to the Director of
18
19

BE IT ENACTED BY THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF OKLAHOMA:
20
21
SECTION 1. NEW LAW A new section of law to be codified
21
22
in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 34.701 of Title 62, unless there
22
23
is created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:
23
24
24
Req. No. 94 Page 1

1
A. There is hereby created in the State Treasury a fund to be
1
2
known and designated as the “Oklahoma School Districts Carryover
2
3
Investment Fund”. The fund shall be a continuing fund, not subject
3
4
to fiscal year limitations, and shall consist of individual accounts
4
5
for each school district electing to invest carryover from the
5
6
general fund of the school district, as defined in Section 1-117 of
6
7
Title 70 of the Oklahoma Statutes.
7
8
B. The State Treasurer shall appoint qualified investment
8
9
managers to provide for the investment of the monies of the fund.
9
10
The investments shall be consistent with the manner in which state
10
11
retirement funds are invested. The risk of large losses shall be
11
12
minimized by diversifying the investments in the fund, unless, under
12
13
the circumstances, it is clearly prudent not to do so, which shall
13
14
include the length of time of the investment. The investment
14
15
managers may sell investments and realize losses if such action is
15
16
considered advantageous to longer-term return maximization.
16
17
C. Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, income and
17
18
investment return on the principal of each individual account shall
18
19
accrue to such account.
19
20
D. For each fiscal year, the State Treasurer shall
20
21
electronically submit a report to each school district for which an
21
22
individual account is created pursuant to subsection A of this
22
23
section detailing the present value of the investments and assets in
23
24
the account and the increase in value from the previous fiscal year.
24
Req. No. 94 Page 2

1
E. For each fiscal year, a school district for which an
1
2
individual account is created may elect to make a deposit or
2
3
withdrawal from the fund; provided, the district shall provide
3
4
notification to the State Treasurer of the intention to make a
4
5
deposit or withdrawal at least thirty (30) days prior to the deposit
5
6
or withdrawal. Withdrawals from the account shall be deposited in
6
7
the general fund of the school district.
7
8
F. Investment managers appointed pursuant to subsection B of
8
9
this section shall maintain a reasonable proportion of liquid assets
9
10
in the Oklahoma School Districts Carryover Investment Fund in order
10
11
to facilitate any expected withdrawals pursuant to subsection E of
11
12
this section. In the event the balance of the Oklahoma School
12
13
Districts Carryover Investment Fund is insufficient or the cash
13
14
available in the fund is insufficient due to lack of liquid assets
14
15
to make the withdrawals requested pursuant to subsection E of this
15
16
section, the entire balance available for transfer shall be
16
17
available for withdrawal.
17
18
SECTION 2. AMENDATORY 70 O.S. 2021, Section 18-200.1, as

20
21

21
22

22
23
initial allocation of State Aid calculated based on the state
23
24
dedicated revenues actually collected during the preceding fiscal
24
Req. No. 94 Page 3

1
year, the adjusted assessed valuation of the preceding year, and the
1
2
weighted average daily membership for the school district of the
2
3
preceding school year. Each school district shall submit the
3
4
following data based on the first nine (9) weeks, to be used in the
4
5
calculation of the average daily membership of the school district:
5
6
1. Student enrollment by grade level;
6
7
2. Pupil category counts; and
7
8
3. Transportation supplement data.
8
9
On or before December 30, the State Department of Education
9
10
shall determine each school district’s current year allocation
10
11
pursuant to subsection D of this section. The State Department of
11
12
Education shall complete an audit, using procedures established by
12
13
the Department, of the student enrollment by grade level data, pupil
13
14
category counts, and transportation supplement data to be used in
14
15
the State Aid Formula pursuant to subsection D of this section by
15
16

20
21
Except for reductions made due to the assessment of penalties by the
21
22
State Department of Education according to law, the January payment
22
23
of State Aid and each subsequent payment for the remainder of the
23
24
24
Req. No. 94 Page 4

1
school year shall not decrease by an amount more than the amount
1
2
that the current chargeable revenue increases for that district.
2
3
B. The State Department of Education shall retain not less than
3
4
one and one-half percent (1 1/2%) of the total funds appropriated
4
5
for financial support of schools, to be used to make midyear
5
6
adjustments in State Aid and which shall be reflected in the final
6
7
allocations. If the amount of appropriated funds, including the one
7
8
and one-half percent (1 1/2%) retained, remaining after January 1 of
8
9
each year is not sufficient to fully fund the final allocations, the
9
10
Department shall recalculate each school district’s remaining
10
11
allocation pursuant to subsection D of this section using the
11
12
reduced amount of appropriated funds.
12
13
C. On and after July 1, 1997, the amount of State Aid each
13
14
district shall receive shall be the sum of the Foundation Aid, the
14
15
Salary Incentive Aid, and the Transportation Supplement, as adjusted
15
16
pursuant to the provisions of subsection G of this section and
16
17
Section 18-112.2 of this title; provided, no district having per
17
18
pupil revenue in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the
18
19
average per pupil revenue of all districts shall receive any State
19
20
Aid or Supplement in State Aid.
20
21
The July calculation of per pupil revenue shall be determined by
21
22
dividing the district’s second preceding year’s total weighted
22
23
average daily membership (ADM) into the district’s preceding year’s
23
24
total revenues excluding federal revenue, insurance loss payments,
24
Req. No. 94 Page 5

1
reimbursements, recovery of overpayments and refunds, unused
1
2
reserves, prior expenditures recovered, prior year surpluses, and
2
3
less the amount of any transfer fees paid in that year.
3
4
The December calculation of per pupil revenue shall be
4
5
determined by dividing the district’s preceding year’s total
5
6
weighted average daily membership (ADM) into the district’s
6
7
preceding year’s total revenues excluding federal revenue, insurance
7
8
loss payments, reimbursements, recovery of overpayments and refunds,
8
9
unused reserves, prior expenditures recovered, prior year surpluses,

13
Salary Incentive Aid shall be calculated as follows:
13
14
1. Foundation Aid shall be determined by subtracting the amount
14
15

17
a. The Foundation Program shall be a district’s higher
17
18
weighted average daily membership based on the first
18
19
nine (9) weeks of the current school year or the
19
20
preceding school year of a school district, as
20
21
determined by the provisions of subsection A of

22
Section 18-201.1 of this title and paragraphs 1, 2, 3,
