16 C. 1. If a carrier files a base rate change and the
17 administrative expense loading component, not including taxes and
18 assessments, increases by more than the most recent calendar year's
19 percentage increase in the dental services Consumer Price Index for
20 All Urban Consumers, U.S. city average, not seasonally adjusted, the
21 base rate shall be deemed excessive and presumptively disapproved.
22 2. If the carrier's rate is presumptively disapproved:
23 a. the carrier shall communicate to all employers and
24 individuals covered under a group product that the
Req. No. 12285 Page 7

4 hearing and shall properly advertise the hearing in

6 D. The carrier shall submit expected rate increases to the
7 Commissioner at least sixty (60) days prior to the proposed

9 or disapprove the rate filings within a sixty-day period, the
10 carrier may implement and reasonably rely upon the rates provided,
11 and the Commissioner may require correction of any deficiencies in
12 the rate filing upon later review if the rate the carrier charged is
13 excessive, inadequate, or unfairly discriminatory. A prospective
14 rate adjustment or rebate as described in Section 2 of this act are
15 the sole remedies for rate deficiencies. If the Commissioner finds
16 deficiencies in the rate filing after a sixty-day period, the
17 Commissioner shall provide notice to the carrier, and the carrier
18 shall correct the rate on a prospective basis.

13 dental loss ratios and shall treat all claims, premiums, and other
14 data as confidential.
15 SECTION 5. AMENDATORY 36 O.S. 2021, Section 7301, is
16 amended to read as follows:

21 services under the applicable subscriber agreement.

13 maintain appeal procedures for any claim by a dentist or a
14 subscriber that is denied based on lack of medical necessity. Any

16 holds a nonrestricted license in the United States. Any written
17 communication to a dentist that includes or pertains to a denial of
18 benefits for all or part of a claim on the basis of a lack of
19 medical necessity shall include the identifier and license number
20 together with state of issuance, and a contact telephone number of
21 the licensed dentist making the adverse determination. The dentist
22 who reviewed the claim shall only be contacted at the telephone

24 business hours.
