Req. No. 11307 Page 6

1 esta blish rates for any dental coverage plan issued to any
2 policyholder that are excessive, inadequate, or unfairly
3 discriminatory. To assure compliance with the requirements of this
4 section that rates are not excessive in relation to benefits, the
5 Insurance Commissioner shall promulgate rules to require rate
6 filings and shall require the submission of adequate documentation
7 and supporting information, including actuarial opinions or
8 certifications that the rates proposed by dental plans result in the
9 MLR meeting or exceeding the ratios described in subsection A of
10 Section 2 of this act.
11 C. 1. If a carrier files a base rate change and the
12 administrative expense loading component, not including taxes and
13 assessments, increases by more than the most recent calendar year's
14 percentage increase in the dental services Consumer Price Index for
15 All Urban Consumers, U.S. city average, not seasonally adjusted, the
16 base rate shall be deemed excessive and presumptively disapproved.
17 2. If the carrier's rate is presumptively disapproved:
18 a. the carrier shall communicate to all employers and
19 individuals covered under a group product that the
20 proposed increase has been presumptively disapproved
21 and is subject to a hearing by the Department, and
22 b. the Insurance Department shall conduct a public
23 hearing and shall properly advertise the hearing in
24 compliance with public hearing requirements.
Req. No. 11307 Page 7

1 D. The carrier shall submit expected rate increases to the
2 Commissioner at least sixty (60) days prior to the proposed
3 implementation of the rates. If the Commissioner does not approve
4 or disapprove the rate filings within a sixty-day period, the
5 carrier may implement and reasonably rely upon the rates provided,
6 and the Commissioner may require correction of any deficiencies in
7 the rate filing upon later review if the rate the carrier charged is
8 excessive, inadequate, or unfairly discriminatory. A prospective
9 rate adjustment or rebate as described in Section 2 of this act are
10 the sole remedies for rate deficiencies. If the Commissioner finds
11 deficiencies in the rate filing after a sixty-day period, the
12 Commissioner shall provide notice to the carrier, and the carrier
13 shall correct the rate on a prospective basis.

8 dental loss ratios and shall treat all claims, premiums, and other
9 data as confidential.

11 amended to read as follows:
