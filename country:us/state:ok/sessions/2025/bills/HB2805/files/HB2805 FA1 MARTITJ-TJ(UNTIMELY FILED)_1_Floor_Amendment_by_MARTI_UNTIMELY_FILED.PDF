Req. No. 13368 Page 1

1 SECTION 2. NEW LAW A new section of law to be codified
2 in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 7141 of Title 36, unless there
3 is created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:
4 A. As used in this act:
5 1. "Commissioner" means the Insurance Commissioner of this
6 state;
7 2. "Dental carrier" or "carrier" means a dental insurance
8 company, dental service corporation, dental plan organization
9 authorized to provide dental benefits, or a health benefits plan
10 that includes coverage for dental services;
11 3. "Dental health care service plan" or "plan" means any plan
12 that provides coverage for dental health care services to enrollees
13 in exchange for premiums, and does not include plans under Medicaid,
14 the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), or employer-
15 sponsored self-funded plans covered by the federal Employee
16 Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA); and
17 4. "Dental loss ratio" or "DLR" means percentage of premium
18 dollars spent on patient care as calculated pursuant to subsection B
19 in this section.
20 B. The dental loss ratio is calculated by dividing the
21 numerator by the denominator, where:
22 1. The numerator is the sum of the amount incurred for clinical
23 dental services provided to enrollees, the amount incurred on
24
Req. No. 13368 Page 2

1 acti vities that improve dental care quality, and other incurred
2 claims as defined at 45 C.F.R., Section 158.140(a); and
3 2. The denominator is the total amount of premium revenue,
4 excluding federal and state taxes, licensing and regulatory fees
5 paid, nonprofit community expenditures as defined at 45 C.F.R.,
6 Section 158.162(c), and any other payments required by federal law.
7 C. The Commissioner shall define by order, rule, or bulletin:
8 1. Expenditures for clinical dental services;
9 2. Activities that improve dental care quality, activities

11 not exceed five percent (5%) of net premium revenue; and
12 3. Overhead and administrative cost expenditures.
13 D. Overhead and administrative costs shall not be included in
14 the numerator.
15 SECTION 3. NEW LAW A new section of law to be codified
16 in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 7142 of Title 36, unless there
17 is created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:
18 A. A carrier that issues, sells, renews, or offers a dental
19 health care service plan contract shall electronically file in the
20 manner and format prescribed by the Commissioner a Dental Loss Ratio
21 (DLR) annual report with the Commissioner, along with any
22 transaction or other filing fees. The Commissioner may create the
23 reporting form or use the federal Medical Loss Ratio (MLR) Annual
24 Reporting Form (CMS-10418) in use for that reporting period. The
Req. No. 13368 Page 3

1 DLR annual report shall report the DLR calculated in accordance with
2 this Act, be organized by market and product type, and include any
3 additional data the Commissioner deems necessary, which shall
4 include but is not limited to, the number of enrollees, the plan
5 cost-sharing and deductible amounts, the annual maximum coverage
6 limit, and the number of enrollees who meet or exceed the annual
7 coverage limit.
8 B. The DLR annual report shall be filed with the Commissioner
9 no later than May 1, 2026, and annually thereafter no later than May
10 1 of each year. The DLR reporting year shall be for the preceding
11 calendar year during which dental coverage is provided by the plan.
12 All terms used in the DLR annual report shall have the same meaning
13 as used in the federal Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C., Section
14 300gg-18), Part 158 (commencing with 158.101) of Title 45 of the
15 Code of Federal Regulations, and 42 U.S.C., Section 1367.003.
16 C. Every carrier, upon receipt of any inquiry from the
17 Commissioner, shall, within twenty (20) days from receipt of the
18 inquiry, furnish the Commissioner with an adequate response,
19 including but not limited to any requested documents or information.
20 D. By January 1 of the year after the Commissioner receives the
21 dental loss ratio information collected pursuant to subsection A of
22 this section, the Commissioner shall make the information, including
23 the aggregate dental loss ratio and other data reported pursuant to
24 this section, available to the public in a searchable format on the
Req. No. 13368 Page 4

1 Okla homa Insurance Department's website that allows members of the
2 public to compare dental loss ratios among carriers by plan type.
3 E. The Commissioner shall report the data in this section to
4 the Legislature.
5 SECTION 4. NEW LAW A new section of law to be codified
6 in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 7143 of Title 36, unless there
7 is created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:
8 A. The Commissioner shall aggregate dental loss ratios for each
9 carrier by year pursuant to Section 3 of this act for each market
10 segment in which the carrier operates. The Commissioner shall
11 calculate an average dental loss ratio (DLR) for each market segment
12 using aggregate data for a three-year period including data for the
13 most recent dental loss ratio reporting year and the data for the
14 two (2) prior dental loss ratio reporting years.
15 Newer experience shall be subject to reporting standards defined
16 in 45 C.F.R., Section 158.121.
17 B. The Commissioner shall calculate an average dental loss
18 ratio for each market segment using the data pursuant to subsection
19 A of this section, identify as outliers dental plans that fall
20 outside one standard deviation of the average dental loss ratio, and
21 report those plans to the Legislature consistent with the manner set
22 forth in subsections D and E of Section 3 of this act.
23 A carrier shall not be considered an outlier if its DLR in a
24 market segment is within three (3) percentage points of the average
Req. No. 13368 Page 5

1 dent al loss ratio. A higher threshold may be set in unique
2 circumstances as determined reasonable by the Commissioner.
3 C. The Commissioner shall investigate those carriers that
4 report a DLR lower than one standard deviation from the mathematical
5 average, and may take remediation or enforcement actions against
6 them, including ordering such carriers to rebate, in a manner
7 consistent with 45 C.F.R., Part 158(B) of the Affordable Care Act
8 all premiums paid above such amounts that would have caused said
9 carrier to have achieved the mathematical average of the data
10 submitted in a given year for a given market segment.
11 D. The report in subsection B of this section shall be
12 organized to show year-over-year changes in a carrierâ€™s outlier
13 status relative to meeting the one (1) standard deviation outlier
14 standard at subsection B of this section. If the DLR for a carrier
15 in a market segment does not increase and remains an outlier as
16 defined in subsection B of this section after two (2) consecutive
17 years, barring unique circumstances as determined reasonable by the
18 Commissioner, the carrier shall be subject to a minimum DLR
19 percentage by market segment. The Commissioner shall promulgate
20 rules establishing the DLR percentage based on, at minimum, the
21 average of existing carrier loss ratios by market segment in the
22 state to be effective no sooner than forty-two (42) months after a
23 carrier is determined to be an outlier as defined in this section.
24
Req. No. 13368 Page 6

1 E. A carrier subject to remediation in subsections C and D of
2 this section shall provide any rebate owing to a policyholder no
3 later than August 1 of the fiscal year following the year for which
4 the ratio described in subsection A of this section was calculated.
5 The Commissioner may establish alternatives to direct rebates to
6 include premium reductions in the following benefit year.
7 F. The Commissioner may promulgate rules that create a process
8 to identify carriers that increase rates in excess of the percentage
9 increase of the latest dental services Consumer Price Index as
10 reported through the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics.
11 G. The Commissioner shall adopt rules as necessary to
12 effectuate the provisions of this act.
13 SECTION 5. This act shall become effective November 1, 2025.
