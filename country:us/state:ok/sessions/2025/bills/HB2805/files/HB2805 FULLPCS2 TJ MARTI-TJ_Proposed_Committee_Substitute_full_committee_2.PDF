22 This act shall be known and may be cited as the "Oklahoma
23 Medical Loss Ratios for Dental (DLR) Health Care Services Plans
24 Act".
Req. No. 13201 Page 1

1 SECTION 2. NEW LAW A new section of law to be codified
2 in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 7141 of Title 36, unless there
3 is created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:
4 A. As used in this act:
5 1. "Commissioner" means the Insurance Commissioner of this
6 state;
7 2. "Dental carrier" or "carrier" means a dental insurance
8 company, dental service corporation, dental plan organization
9 authorized to provide dental benefits, or a health benefits plan
10 that includes coverage for dental services;
11 3. "Dental health care service plan" or "plan" means any plan
12 that provides coverage for dental health care services to enrollees
13 in exchange for premiums, and does not include plans under Medicaid
14 or Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP); and
15 4. "Dental loss ratio" or "DLR" means percentage of premium
16 dollars spent on patient care as calculated pursuant to subsection B
17 in this section.
18 B. The dental loss ratio is calculated by dividing the
19 numerator by the denominator, where:
20 1. The numerator is the sum of the amount incurred for clinical
21 dental services provided to enrollees, the amount incurred on
22 activities that improve dental care quality, and other incurred
23 claims as defined at 45 C.F.R., Section 158.140(a); and
24
Req. No. 13201 Page 2

1 2. The denominator is the total amount of premium revenue,
2 excluding federal and state taxes, licensing and regulatory fees
3 paid, nonprofit community expenditures as defined at 45 C.F.R.,
4 Section 158.162(c), and any other payments required by federal law.
5 C. The Commissioner shall define by rule:
6 1. Expenditures for clinical dental services;
7 2. Activities that improve dental care quality, activities
8 conducted by an issuer intended to improve dental care quality shall
9 not exceed five percent (5%) of net premium revenue; and
10 3. Overhead and administrative cost expenditures.
11 D. The definitions promulgated by rule pursuant to this section
12 shall be consistent with similar definitions that are used for the
13 reporting of medical loss ratios by carriers offering health benefit
14 plans in this state. Overhead and administrative costs shall not be
15 included in the numerator.
16 SECTION 3. NEW LAW A new section of law to be codified
17 in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 7142 of Title 36, unless there
18 is created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:
19 A. A carrier that issues, sells, renews, or offers a
20 specialized dental health care service plan contract shall file a
21 Dental Loss Ratio (DLR) annual report with the Commissioner that is
22 organized by market and product type and contains the same
23 information required in the 2013 federal Medical Loss Ratio (MLR)
24 Annual Reporting Form (CMS-10418). The filing shall also report
Req. No. 13201 Page 3

1 addi tional data that includes the number of enrollees, the plan
2 cost-sharing and deductible amounts, the annual maximum coverage
3 limit, and the number of enrollees who meet or exceed the annual
4 coverage limit.
5 B. The DLR reporting year shall be for the fiscal year during
6 which dental coverage is provided by the plan. All terms used in
7 the DLR annual report shall have the same meaning as used in the
8 federal Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C., Section 300gg-18),
9 Part 158 (commencing with 158.101) of Title 45 of the Code of
10 Federal Regulations, and 42 U.S.C., Section 1367.003.
11 C. If data verification of the carrier's representations in the
12 DLR annual report is deemed necessary, the Commissioner shall
13 provide the carrier with a notification thirty (30) days to submit
14 any information required by the Commissioner.
15 D. By January 1 of the year after the Commissioner receives the
16 dental loss ratio information collected pursuant to subsection A of
17 this section, the Commissioner shall make the information, including
18 the aggregate dental loss ratio and other data reported pursuant to
19 this section, available to the public in a searchable format on a
20 public website that allows members of the public to compare dental
21 loss ratios among carriers by plan type by:
22 1. Posting the information on the division’s website; or
23 2. Providing the information to the administrator of an all-
24 payer health claims database. If the Commissioner provides the
Req. No. 13201 Page 4

1 info rmation to the administrator, the administrator shall make the
2 information available to the public in a format determined by the
3 Commissioner.
4 E. The Commissioner shall report the data in this section to
5 the Legislature.
6 SECTION 4. NEW LAW A new section of law to be codified
7 in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 7143 of Title 36, unless there
8 is created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:
9 A. The Commissioner shall aggregate dental loss ratios for each
10 carrier by year pursuant to Section 3 of this act for each market
11 segment in which the carrier operates. The Commissioner shall
12 calculate an average dental loss ratio (DLR) for each market segment
13 using aggregate data for a three-year period including data for the
14 most recent dental loss ratio reporting year and the data for the
15 two (2) prior dental loss ratio reporting years.
16 Newer experience shall be subject to reporting standards defined
17 in 45 C.F.R., Section 158.121.
18 B. The Commissioner shall calculate an average dental loss
19 ratio for each market segment using the data pursuant to subsection
20 A of this section, identify as outliers dental plans that fall
21 outside one standard deviation of the average dental loss ratio, and
22 report those plans to the Legislature consistent with the manner set
23 forth in subsections D and E of Section 3 of this act.
24
Req. No. 13201 Page 5

1 A carrier shall not be considered an outlier if its DLR in a
2 market segment is within three (3) percentage points of the average
3 dental loss ratio. A higher threshold may be set in unique
4 circumstances as determined reasonable by the Commissioner.
5 C. The Commissioner shall investigate those carriers that
6 report a DLR lower than one standard deviation from the mathematical
7 average, and may take remediation or enforcement actions against
8 them, including ordering such carriers to rebate, in a manner
9 consistent with 45 C.F.R., Part 158(B) of the Affordable Care Act
10 all premiums paid above such amounts that would have caused said
11 carrier to have achieved the mathematical average of the data
12 submitted in a given year for a given market segment.
13 D. The report in subsection B of this section shall be
14 organized to show year-over-year changes in a carrier’s outlier
15 status relative to meeting the one (1) standard deviation outlier
16 standard at subsection B of this section. If the DLR for a carrier
17 in a market segment does not increase and remains an outlier as
18 defined in subsection B of this section after two (2) consecutive
19 years, barring unique circumstances as determined reasonable by the
20 Commissioner, the carrier shall be subject to a minimum DLR
21 percentage by market segment. The Commissioner shall promulgate
22 rules establishing the DLR percentage based on, at minimum, the
23 average of existing carrier loss ratios by market segment in the
24
Req. No. 13201 Page 6

1 stat e to be effective no sooner than forty-two (42) months after a
2 carrier is determined to be an outlier as defined in this section.
3 E. A carrier subject to remediation in subsections C and D of
4 this section shall provide any rebate owing to a policyholder no
5 later than March 1 of the fiscal year following the year for which
6 the ratio described in subsection A of this section was calculated.
7 The Commissioner may establish alternatives to direct rebates to
8 include premium reductions in the following benefit year.
9 F. The Commissioner may promulgate rules that create a process
10 to identify carriers that increase rates in excess of the percentage
11 increase of the latest dental services Consumer Price Index as
12 reported through the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics.
13 G. The Commissioner shall adopt rules as necessary to
14 effectuate the provisions of this act.
15 SECTION 5. AMENDATORY 36 O.S. 2021, Section 7301, is
16 amended to read as follows:
17 Section 7301. A. No contract between a dental plan of a health
18 benefit plan and a dentist for the provision of services to patients
19 may require that a dentist provide services to its subscribers at a
20 fee set by the health benefit plan unless the services are covered
21 services under the applicable subscriber agreement.
22 B. As used in this section:
23 1. "Covered services" means services reimbursable under the
24 applicable subscriber agreement, subject to the contractual
Req. No. 13201 Page 7

1 limi tations on subscriber benefits as may apply, including, for
2 example, deductibles, waiting period or frequency limitations;
3 2. "Dental plan" means and shall include any policy of
4 insurance which is issued by a health benefit plan which provides
5 for coverage of dental services not in connection with a medical
6 plan; and
7 3. 2. "Health benefit plan" means any plan or arrangement as
8 defined in subsection C of Section 6060.4 of this title or any
9 dental service corporation authorized pursuant to Section 2671 of
10 this title.
11 C. B. A health benefit plan or dental plan shall establish and
12 maintain appeal procedures for any claim by a dentist or a
13 subscriber that is denied based on lack of medical necessity. Any
14 such denial shall be based upon a determination by a dentist who
15 holds a nonrestricted license in the United States. Any written
16 communication to a dentist that includes or pertains to a denial of
17 benefits for all or part of a claim on the basis of a lack of
18 medical necessity shall include the identifier and license number
19 together with state of issuance, and a contact telephone number of
20 the licensed dentist making the adverse determination. The dentist
21 who reviewed the claim shall only be contacted at the telephone
22 number provided in the written communication about the denial during
23 business hours.
24
