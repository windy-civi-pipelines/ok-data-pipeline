8 third-party payor, or its agent shall not:
9 1. Reimburse a 340B entity for 340B drugs at a rate lower than

11 less restrictive than federal law for a person or entity regulated
12 by this act.
13 B. Nothing in this act is to be construed or applied to be in
14 conflict with any of the following:
15 1. Applicable federal law and related regulations; or

17 applicable federal law.
18 C. Limited distribution of a drug required under Section 355-1
