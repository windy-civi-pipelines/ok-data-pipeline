A. With respect to reimbursement to a 340B entity for 340B
drugs, a health insurance issuer, pharmacy benefits manager, other
third-party payor, or its agent shall not:
1. Reimburse a 340B entity for 340B drugs at a rate lower than
that paid for the same drug to entities that are not 340B entities
or lower reimbursement for a claim on the basis that the claim is
for a 340B drug;
2. Impose any terms or conditions on any 340B entity with
respect to any of the following that differ from such terms or
conditions applied to non-340B entities on the basis that the entity

a 340B drug including, without limitation, any of the following:
a. fees, charges, clawbacks, or other adjustments or

4. Discriminate against a 340B entity in a manner that prevents
or interferes with any patient's choice to receive such drugs from
the 340B entity, including the administration of such drugs. For

ENR. H. B. NO. 2048 Page 4

7. Exclude any 340B entity from the health insurance issuer,
pharmacy benefits manager, or other third-party payor network on the
basis that the 340B entity dispenses drugs subject to an agreement

refusing to contract with a 340B entity for reasons other than those
that apply equally to non-340B entities.

not prevent the Insurance Department from seeking assistance from
