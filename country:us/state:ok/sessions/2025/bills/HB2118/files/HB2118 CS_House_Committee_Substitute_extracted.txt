21 officer determine that the punishment options will not include
22 arrest in quarters or restriction, the accused member shall be

12 2. Arrest in quarters to restriction; or
13 3. Extra duties to restriction.
14 The mitigated punishment shall not be for a greater period than the
15 punishment mitigated. When mitigating reduction in grade to
16 forfeiture of pay, the amount of the forfeiture shall not be greater
17 than the amount that could have been imposed initially under this
18 article by the officer who imposed the punishment mitigated.
19 K. A person punished under this section who considers the
20 punishment unjust or disproportionate to the offense may, through
21 his or her chain of command, appeal to a senior officer designated
22 by the Adjutant General to adjudicate appeals arising from
23 nonjudicial punishment. A senior officer so designated by the
24 Adjutant General shall be a member of the same component of the
Req. No. 13221 Page 16
1 stat e military forces as the accused. An appeal made pursuant to
2 this subsection shall be lodged within fifteen (15) days after the

4 officer exercising appellate authority may, at his or her
5 discretion, extend the deadline for an appeal. The appeal shall be
6 promptly forwarded and decided, and the member shall not be punished
7 until the appeal is decided. The senior officer designated by the
8 Adjutant General as exercising appellate authority may exercise the
9 same powers with respect to the punishment imposed as may be
10 exercised under subsection I of this section by the officer who
11 imposed the punishment. Before acting on an appeal from a
12 punishment, the senior officer exercising appellate authority shall
13 refer the case to a judge advocate for consideration and advice.
14 When a senior officer is designated by the Adjutant General to
15 adjudicate appeals arising from nonjudicial punishment, such
16 designation shall be accomplished in writing and shall be considered
17 a military publication, as defined in Section 801 of this title
18 (Article 1).
19 L. Except for nonjudicial punishment imposed by the Governor or
20 the Adjutant General, the final appellate authority for nonjudicial
21 punishment imposed within state military forces is the Adjutant
22 General. A person punished under this section whose appeal was
23 previously denied by a senior officer designated to adjudicate
24 appeals may, through his or her chain of command, lodge an
Req. No. 13221 Page 17
1 addi tional appeal with the Adjutant General within five (5) days
2 after the appeal is denied. In the event the officer imposing
3 nonjudicial punishment is a senior officer who is also designated to
4 adjudicate appeals arising from nonjudicial punishment, an appeal
5 thereof shall be addressed directly to the Adjutant General. In the
6 event the officer imposing nonjudicial punishment is the Adjutant
7 General, an appeal thereof shall be addressed directly to the
8 Governor. An appeal offered pursuant to this subsection shall be
9 made only in writing. Neither the Governor nor the Adjutant General
10 shall delegate his or her duties as an appellate authority under
11 this subsection.
12 M. Whenever nonjudicial punishment is imposed under this
13 section:
14 1. After adjudication and while the punishment is being carried
15 out or while the adjudged punishment is pending before the appellate
16 authority, the commander or officer in charge who imposed the
17 nonjudicial punishment, upon the request of the accused member, may:
18 a. excuse the accused member from attendance at scheduled
19 unit training assemblies, or
20 b. arrange for the accused member to drill on alternate
21 dates and in alternate locations; or
22 2. If necessary to maintain good order and discipline within
23 the unit, the commander or officer in charge commanding officer who
24 imposed the nonjudicial punishment may order the accused member to
Req. No. 13221 Page 18
1 dril l on alternate dates and in alternate locations. The order
2 shall be reduced to writing and shall become part of the record of
3 nonjudicial punishment.
4 N. The imposition and enforcement of disciplinary punishment
5 under this section for any act or omission shall not be a bar to
6 trial by court-martial or a civilian court of competent jurisdiction
7 for a crime or offense arising out of the same act or omission; but
8 the fact that a disciplinary punishment has been enforced may be
9 demonstrated by the accused member upon trial and, when so
10 demonstrated, it shall be considered in determining the measure of
11 punishment to be adjudged in the event of a finding or verdict of
12 guilty. Nonjudicial punishment shall not be imposed for an offense
13 previously tried by a civilian court unless so authorized by
14 regulations promulgated by the Adjutant General.
15 O. When nonjudicial punishment has been imposed for an offense,
16 punishment shall not again be imposed for the same offense under
17 this section. Once nonjudicial punishment has been imposed, it may
18 not be increased, upon appeal or otherwise. When a commander or
19 officer in charge commanding officer determines that nonjudicial
20 punishment is appropriate for a particular member, all known
21 offenses determined to be appropriate for disposition by nonjudicial
22 punishment and ready to be considered at that time, including all
23 offenses arising from a single incident or course of conduct, shall
24 be considered together and shall not be made the basis for multiple
Req. No. 13221 Page 19
1 puni shments. This subsection shall in no way restrict the right of
2 a commander commanding officer to prefer court-martial charges for
3 an offense previously punished under the provisions of this section.
4 P. In accordance with subsection B of Section 843 of this title
5 (Article 43, subsection B), a person accused of an offense is not
6 liable to be punished under this section if the offense was
7 committed more than two (2) years before the imposition of
8 punishment. Periods in which the accused member is absent without
9 authority shall be excluded in computing the period of limitation

10 judge advocate available for this purpose. Upon notification by the
11 officer of his or her intent to impose judicial punishment, the
12 member shall provide a response within forty-five (45) calendar
13 days.
14 I. The right to demand trial by court-martial in lieu of
15 nonjudicial punishment shall arise only when arrest in quarters or
16 restriction will be considered as punishments. If the commanding
17 officer determines that arrest in quarters or restriction will be
18 considered as punishments, prior to the offer of nonjudicial
19 punishment the accused member shall be notified in writing of the
20 right to demand trial by court-martial. Should the commanding
21 officer determine that the punishment options will not include
22 arrest in quarters or restriction, the accused member shall be
23 notified that there is no right to trial by court-martial in lieu of
24 nonjudicial punishment. Upon notification by the commander or
Req. No. 13221 Page 15

7 her successor in command, may at any time suspend, set aside,
8 mitigate or remit any part or amount of the punishment and restore
9 all rights, privileges and property affected. The commanding
10 officer may also mitigate:
11 1. Reduction in grade to forfeiture of pay;
12 2. Arrest in quarters to restriction; or
13 3. Extra duties to restriction.
14 The mitigated punishment shall not be for a greater period than the
15 punishment mitigated. When mitigating reduction in grade to
16 forfeiture of pay, the amount of the forfeiture shall not be greater
17 than the amount that could have been imposed initially under this
18 article by the officer who imposed the punishment mitigated.
19 K. A person punished under this section who considers the
20 punishment unjust or disproportionate to the offense may, through
21 his or her chain of command, appeal to a senior officer designated
22 by the Adjutant General to adjudicate appeals arising from
23 nonjudicial punishment. A senior officer so designated by the
24 Adjutant General shall be a member of the same component of the
Req. No. 13221 Page 16

6 promptly forwarded and decided, and the member shall not be punished
7 until the appeal is decided. The senior officer designated by the
8 Adjutant General as exercising appellate authority may exercise the
9 same powers with respect to the punishment imposed as may be
10 exercised under subsection I of this section by the officer who
11 imposed the punishment. Before acting on an appeal from a
12 punishment, the senior officer exercising appellate authority shall
13 refer the case to a judge advocate for consideration and advice.
14 When a senior officer is designated by the Adjutant General to
15 adjudicate appeals arising from nonjudicial punishment, such
16 designation shall be accomplished in writing and shall be considered
17 a military publication, as defined in Section 801 of this title
18 (Article 1).
19 L. Except for nonjudicial punishment imposed by the Governor or
20 the Adjutant General, the final appellate authority for nonjudicial
21 punishment imposed within state military forces is the Adjutant
22 General. A person punished under this section whose appeal was
23 previously denied by a senior officer designated to adjudicate
24 appeals may, through his or her chain of command, lodge an
Req. No. 13221 Page 17

1 addi tional appeal with the Adjutant General within five (5) days
2 after the appeal is denied. In the event the officer imposing
3 nonjudicial punishment is a senior officer who is also designated to
4 adjudicate appeals arising from nonjudicial punishment, an appeal
5 thereof shall be addressed directly to the Adjutant General. In the
6 event the officer imposing nonjudicial punishment is the Adjutant
7 General, an appeal thereof shall be addressed directly to the
8 Governor. An appeal offered pursuant to this subsection shall be
9 made only in writing. Neither the Governor nor the Adjutant General
10 shall delegate his or her duties as an appellate authority under
11 this subsection.
12 M. Whenever nonjudicial punishment is imposed under this
13 section:
14 1. After adjudication and while the punishment is being carried
15 out or while the adjudged punishment is pending before the appellate
16 authority, the commander or officer in charge who imposed the
17 nonjudicial punishment, upon the request of the accused member, may:
18 a. excuse the accused member from attendance at scheduled
19 unit training assemblies, or
20 b. arrange for the accused member to drill on alternate
21 dates and in alternate locations; or
22 2. If necessary to maintain good order and discipline within
23 the unit, the commander or officer in charge commanding officer who
24 imposed the nonjudicial punishment may order the accused member to
Req. No. 13221 Page 18

1 dril l on alternate dates and in alternate locations. The order
2 shall be reduced to writing and shall become part of the record of
3 nonjudicial punishment.
4 N. The imposition and enforcement of disciplinary punishment
5 under this section for any act or omission shall not be a bar to
6 trial by court-martial or a civilian court of competent jurisdiction
7 for a crime or offense arising out of the same act or omission; but
8 the fact that a disciplinary punishment has been enforced may be
9 demonstrated by the accused member upon trial and, when so
10 demonstrated, it shall be considered in determining the measure of
11 punishment to be adjudged in the event of a finding or verdict of
12 guilty. Nonjudicial punishment shall not be imposed for an offense
13 previously tried by a civilian court unless so authorized by
14 regulations promulgated by the Adjutant General.
15 O. When nonjudicial punishment has been imposed for an offense,
16 punishment shall not again be imposed for the same offense under
17 this section. Once nonjudicial punishment has been imposed, it may
18 not be increased, upon appeal or otherwise. When a commander or
19 officer in charge commanding officer determines that nonjudicial
20 punishment is appropriate for a particular member, all known
21 offenses determined to be appropriate for disposition by nonjudicial
22 punishment and ready to be considered at that time, including all
23 offenses arising from a single incident or course of conduct, shall
24 be considered together and shall not be made the basis for multiple
Req. No. 13221 Page 19

1 puni shments. This subsection shall in no way restrict the right of
2 a commander commanding officer to prefer court-martial charges for
3 an offense previously punished under the provisions of this section.
4 P. In accordance with subsection B of Section 843 of this title
5 (Article 43, subsection B), a person accused of an offense is not
6 liable to be punished under this section if the offense was
7 committed more than two (2) years before the imposition of
8 punishment. Periods in which the accused member is absent without
9 authority shall be excluded in computing the period of limitation
10 prescribed in this section.
11 Q. Whenever a punishment of forfeiture of pay is imposed under
12 this section, the forfeiture shall not apply to pay accruing before
13 the date that punishment is imposed, but only pay accruing on or
14 after the date that punishment is imposed.
15 R. The Adjutant General may promulgate regulations prescribing
16 the type and form of records to be kept of proceedings conducted
17 pursuant to this section. The Adjutant General may promulgate any
18 other regulations necessary to carry out the provisions of this
19 section.
20 S. For purposes of this section, no member of the Oklahoma
21 National Guard of the rank of E-8 or E-9 shall be reduced in rank
22 pursuant to this section except when the reduction results from
23 nonjudicial punishment imposed by an officer of the Oklahoma
24 National Guard of the rank of Brigadier General or by the Adjutant
Req. No. 13221 Page 20

1 Gene ral. When imposing nonjudicial punishment on enlisted persons
