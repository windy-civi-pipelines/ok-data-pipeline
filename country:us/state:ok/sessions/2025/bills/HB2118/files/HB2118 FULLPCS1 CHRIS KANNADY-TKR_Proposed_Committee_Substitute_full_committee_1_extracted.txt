5 forfeiture of pay, the amount of the forfeiture shall not be greater
6 than the amount that could have been imposed initially under this
7 article by the officer who imposed the punishment mitigated.
8 K. A person punished under this section who considers the
9 punishment unjust or disproportionate to the offense may, through
10 his or her chain of command, appeal to a senior officer designated
11 by the Adjutant General to adjudicate appeals arising from
12 nonjudicial punishment. A senior officer so designated by the
13 Adjutant General shall be a member of the same component of the
14 state military forces as the accused. An appeal made pursuant to

17 officer exercising appellate authority may, at his or her
18 discretion, extend the deadline for an appeal. The appeal shall be
19 promptly forwarded and decided, and the member shall not be punished
20 until the appeal is decided. The senior officer designated by the
21 Adjutant General as exercising appellate authority may exercise the
22 same powers with respect to the punishment imposed as may be
23 exercised under subsection I of this section by the officer who
24 imposed the punishment. Before acting on an appeal from a
Req. No. 13055 Page 16
1 puni shment, the senior officer exercising appellate authority shall
2 refer the case to a judge advocate for consideration and advice.
3 When a senior officer is designated by the Adjutant General to
4 adjudicate appeals arising from nonjudicial punishment, such
5 designation shall be accomplished in writing and shall be considered
6 a military publication, as defined in Section 801 of this title
7 (Article 1).
8 L. Except for nonjudicial punishment imposed by the Governor or
9 the Adjutant General, the final appellate authority for nonjudicial
10 punishment imposed within state military forces is the Adjutant
11 General. A person punished under this section whose appeal was
12 previously denied by a senior officer designated to adjudicate
13 appeals may, through his or her chain of command, lodge an
14 additional appeal with the Adjutant General within five (5) days
15 after the appeal is denied. In the event the officer imposing
16 nonjudicial punishment is a senior officer who is also designated to
17 adjudicate appeals arising from nonjudicial punishment, an appeal
18 thereof shall be addressed directly to the Adjutant General. In the
19 event the officer imposing nonjudicial punishment is the Adjutant
20 General, an appeal thereof shall be addressed directly to the
21 Governor. An appeal offered pursuant to this subsection shall be
22 made only in writing. Neither the Governor nor the Adjutant General
23 shall delegate his or her duties as an appellate authority under
24 this subsection.
Req. No. 13055 Page 17
1 M. Whenever nonjudicial punishment is imposed under this
2 section:
3 1. After adjudication and while the punishment is being carried
4 out or while the adjudged punishment is pending before the appellate

6 nonjudicial punishment, upon the request of the accused member, may:
7 a. excuse the accused member from attendance at scheduled
8 unit training assemblies, or
9 b. arrange for the accused member to drill on alternate
10 dates and in alternate locations; or
11 2. If necessary to maintain good order and discipline within
12 the unit, the commander or officer in charge commanding officer who
13 imposed the nonjudicial punishment may order the accused member to
14 drill on alternate dates and in alternate locations. The order
15 shall be reduced to writing and shall become part of the record of
16 nonjudicial punishment.
17 N. The imposition and enforcement of disciplinary punishment
18 under this section for any act or omission shall not be a bar to
19 trial by court-martial or a civilian court of competent jurisdiction
20 for a crime or offense arising out of the same act or omission; but
21 the fact that a disciplinary punishment has been enforced may be
22 demonstrated by the accused member upon trial and, when so
23 demonstrated, it shall be considered in determining the measure of
24 punishment to be adjudged in the event of a finding or verdict of
Req. No. 13055 Page 18
1 guil ty. Nonjudicial punishment shall not be imposed for an offense
2 previously tried by a civilian court unless so authorized by
3 regulations promulgated by the Adjutant General.
4 O. When nonjudicial punishment has been imposed for an offense,
5 punishment shall not again be imposed for the same offense under
6 this section. Once nonjudicial punishment has been imposed, it may
7 not be increased, upon appeal or otherwise. When a commander or
8 officer in charge commanding officer determines that nonjudicial
9 punishment is appropriate for a particular member, all known
10 offenses determined to be appropriate for disposition by nonjudicial
11 punishment and ready to be considered at that time, including all
12 offenses arising from a single incident or course of conduct, shall
13 be considered together and shall not be made the basis for multiple
14 punishments. This subsection shall in no way restrict the right of
15 a commander commanding officer to prefer court-martial charges for
16 an offense previously punished under the provisions of this section.
17 P. In accordance with subsection B of Section 843 of this title
18 (Article 43, subsection B), a person accused of an offense is not
19 liable to be punished under this section if the offense was
20 committed more than two (2) years before the imposition of
21 punishment. Periods in which the accused member is absent without
22 authority shall be excluded in computing the period of limitation
23 prescribed in this section.
24
Req. No. 13055 Page 19

4 after the date that punishment is imposed.
5 R. The Adjutant General may promulgate regulations prescribing

6 length under this section.
7 H. Once the commander commanding officer has determined that
8 nonjudicial punishment is appropriate, the commander commanding
9 officer shall provide reasonable notice to the member of his or her
10 intent to impose nonjudicial punishment. At the time the commander
11 commanding officer provides notification as required in this
12 subsection, the member shall be entitled to examine all statements
13 and other evidence that the commander has examined and intends to
14 rely upon as the basis for punishment. The member shall be provided
15 a copy of the documentary evidence unless it is privileged,
16 classified, or otherwise restricted by law, regulation, or
17 instruction. At the time the commander commanding officer provides
18 notification as required in this subsection, the commander
19 commanding officer shall also inform the member as to the quantum of
20 punishment potentially to be imposed. While a member undergoing
21 nonjudicial punishment is not entitled to representation by a duly
22 appointed defense counsel, the member may seek legal advice from any
23 judge advocate available for this purpose. Upon notification by the
24 officer of his or her intent to impose judicial punishment, the
Req. No. 13055 Page 14

1 memb er shall provide a response within forty-five (45) calendar
2 days.
3 I. The right to demand trial by court-martial in lieu of
4 nonjudicial punishment shall arise only when arrest in quarters or
5 restriction will be considered as punishments. If the commanding
6 officer determines that arrest in quarters or restriction will be
7 considered as punishments, prior to the offer of nonjudicial
8 punishment the accused member shall be notified in writing of the
9 right to demand trial by court-martial. Should the commanding
10 officer determine that the punishment options will not include
11 arrest in quarters or restriction, the accused member shall be
12 notified that there is no right to trial by court-martial in lieu of
13 nonjudicial punishment. Upon notification by the commander or
14 officer in charge commanding officer of his or her intent to impose
15 nonjudicial punishment that includes arrest in quarters or
16 restriction, the accused member shall be afforded a reasonable
17 amount of time to confer with legal counsel and to prepare a
18 response.
19 J. The commanding officer who imposes the punishment, or his or
20 her successor in command, may at any time suspend, set aside,
21 mitigate or remit any part or amount of the punishment and restore
22 all rights, privileges and property affected. The commanding
23 officer may also mitigate:
24 1. Reduction in grade to forfeiture of pay;
Req. No. 13055 Page 15

1 2. Arrest in quarters to restriction; or
2 3. Extra duties to restriction.
3 The mitigated punishment shall not be for a greater period than the
4 punishment mitigated. When mitigating reduction in grade to
5 forfeiture of pay, the amount of the forfeiture shall not be greater
6 than the amount that could have been imposed initially under this
7 article by the officer who imposed the punishment mitigated.
8 K. A person punished under this section who considers the
9 punishment unjust or disproportionate to the offense may, through
10 his or her chain of command, appeal to a senior officer designated
11 by the Adjutant General to adjudicate appeals arising from
12 nonjudicial punishment. A senior officer so designated by the
13 Adjutant General shall be a member of the same component of the
14 state military forces as the accused. An appeal made pursuant to
15 this subsection shall be lodged within fifteen (15) days after the
16 punishment is announced to the accused member. The commanding
17 officer exercising appellate authority may, at his or her
18 discretion, extend the deadline for an appeal. The appeal shall be
19 promptly forwarded and decided, and the member shall not be punished
20 until the appeal is decided. The senior officer designated by the
21 Adjutant General as exercising appellate authority may exercise the
22 same powers with respect to the punishment imposed as may be
23 exercised under subsection I of this section by the officer who
24 imposed the punishment. Before acting on an appeal from a
Req. No. 13055 Page 16

1 puni shment, the senior officer exercising appellate authority shall
2 refer the case to a judge advocate for consideration and advice.
3 When a senior officer is designated by the Adjutant General to
4 adjudicate appeals arising from nonjudicial punishment, such
5 designation shall be accomplished in writing and shall be considered
6 a military publication, as defined in Section 801 of this title
7 (Article 1).
8 L. Except for nonjudicial punishment imposed by the Governor or
9 the Adjutant General, the final appellate authority for nonjudicial
10 punishment imposed within state military forces is the Adjutant
11 General. A person punished under this section whose appeal was
12 previously denied by a senior officer designated to adjudicate
13 appeals may, through his or her chain of command, lodge an
14 additional appeal with the Adjutant General within five (5) days
15 after the appeal is denied. In the event the officer imposing
16 nonjudicial punishment is a senior officer who is also designated to
17 adjudicate appeals arising from nonjudicial punishment, an appeal
18 thereof shall be addressed directly to the Adjutant General. In the
19 event the officer imposing nonjudicial punishment is the Adjutant
20 General, an appeal thereof shall be addressed directly to the
21 Governor. An appeal offered pursuant to this subsection shall be
22 made only in writing. Neither the Governor nor the Adjutant General
23 shall delegate his or her duties as an appellate authority under
24 this subsection.
Req. No. 13055 Page 17

1 M. Whenever nonjudicial punishment is imposed under this
2 section:
3 1. After adjudication and while the punishment is being carried
4 out or while the adjudged punishment is pending before the appellate
5 authority, the commander or officer in charge who imposed the
6 nonjudicial punishment, upon the request of the accused member, may:
7 a. excuse the accused member from attendance at scheduled
8 unit training assemblies, or
9 b. arrange for the accused member to drill on alternate
10 dates and in alternate locations; or
11 2. If necessary to maintain good order and discipline within
12 the unit, the commander or officer in charge commanding officer who
13 imposed the nonjudicial punishment may order the accused member to
14 drill on alternate dates and in alternate locations. The order
15 shall be reduced to writing and shall become part of the record of
16 nonjudicial punishment.
17 N. The imposition and enforcement of disciplinary punishment
18 under this section for any act or omission shall not be a bar to
19 trial by court-martial or a civilian court of competent jurisdiction
20 for a crime or offense arising out of the same act or omission; but
21 the fact that a disciplinary punishment has been enforced may be
22 demonstrated by the accused member upon trial and, when so
23 demonstrated, it shall be considered in determining the measure of
24 punishment to be adjudged in the event of a finding or verdict of
Req. No. 13055 Page 18

1 guil ty. Nonjudicial punishment shall not be imposed for an offense
2 previously tried by a civilian court unless so authorized by
3 regulations promulgated by the Adjutant General.
4 O. When nonjudicial punishment has been imposed for an offense,
5 punishment shall not again be imposed for the same offense under
6 this section. Once nonjudicial punishment has been imposed, it may
7 not be increased, upon appeal or otherwise. When a commander or
8 officer in charge commanding officer determines that nonjudicial
9 punishment is appropriate for a particular member, all known
10 offenses determined to be appropriate for disposition by nonjudicial
11 punishment and ready to be considered at that time, including all
12 offenses arising from a single incident or course of conduct, shall
13 be considered together and shall not be made the basis for multiple
14 punishments. This subsection shall in no way restrict the right of
15 a commander commanding officer to prefer court-martial charges for
16 an offense previously punished under the provisions of this section.
17 P. In accordance with subsection B of Section 843 of this title
18 (Article 43, subsection B), a person accused of an offense is not
19 liable to be punished under this section if the offense was
20 committed more than two (2) years before the imposition of
21 punishment. Periods in which the accused member is absent without
22 authority shall be excluded in computing the period of limitation
23 prescribed in this section.
24
Req. No. 13055 Page 19

1 Q. Whenever a punishment of forfeiture of pay is imposed under
2 this section, the forfeiture shall not apply to pay accruing before
3 the date that punishment is imposed, but only pay accruing on or
4 after the date that punishment is imposed.
5 R. The Adjutant General may promulgate regulations prescribing
6 the type and form of records to be kept of proceedings conducted
7 pursuant to this section. The Adjutant General may promulgate any
8 other regulations necessary to carry out the provisions of this
9 section.
10 S. For purposes of this section, no member of the Oklahoma
11 National Guard of the rank of E-8 or E-9 shall be reduced in rank
12 pursuant to this section except when the reduction results from
13 nonjudicial punishment imposed by an officer of the Oklahoma
14 National Guard of the rank of Brigadier General or by the Adjutant
15 General. When imposing nonjudicial punishment on enlisted persons
16 of the rank of E-7 or below, a commander or officer in charge who
17 possesses the rank of colonel may consider reduction in rank as a
18 possible punishment.
