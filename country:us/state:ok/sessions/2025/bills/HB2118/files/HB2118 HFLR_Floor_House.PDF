3 punishment imposed within state military forces is the Adjutant

5 previously denied by a senior officer designated to adjudicate
6 appeals may, through his or her chain of command, lodge an
7 additional appeal with the Adjutant General within five (5) days
8 after the appeal is denied. In the event the officer imposing
9 nonjudicial punishment is a senior officer who is also designated to
10 adjudicate appeals arising from nonjudicial punishment, an appeal
11 thereof shall be addressed directly to the Adjutant General. In the
12 event the officer imposing nonjudicial punishment is the Adjutant
13 General, an appeal thereof shall be addressed directly to the
14 Governor. An appeal offered pursuant to this subsection shall be
15 made only in writing. Neither the Governor nor the Adjutant General
16 shall delegate his or her duties as an appellate authority under
17 this subsection.
18 M. Whenever nonjudicial punishment is imposed under this
19 section:
20 1. After adjudication and while the punishment is being carried

HB2118 HFLR Page 18
BOLD FACE denotes Committee Amendments.

1 a. excuse the accused member from attendance at scheduled
2 unit training assemblies, or
3 b. arrange for the accused member to drill on alternate
4 dates and in alternate locations; or
5 2. If necessary to maintain good order and discipline within
6 the unit, the commander or officer in charge commanding officer who
7 imposed the nonjudicial punishment may order the accused member to
8 drill on alternate dates and in alternate locations. The order
9 shall be reduced to writing and shall become part of the record of
10 nonjudicial punishment.
11 N. The imposition and enforcement of disciplinary punishment
12 under this section for any act or omission shall not be a bar to
13 trial by court-martial or a civilian court of competent jurisdiction
14 for a crime or offense arising out of the same act or omission; but
15 the fact that a disciplinary punishment has been enforced may be
16 demonstrated by the accused member upon trial and, when so
17 demonstrated, it shall be considered in determining the measure of
18 punishment to be adjudged in the event of a finding or verdict of
19 guilty. Nonjudicial punishment shall not be imposed for an offense
20 previously tried by a civilian court unless so authorized by
21 regulations promulgated by the Adjutant General.
22 O. When nonjudicial punishment has been imposed for an offense,
23 punishment shall not again be imposed for the same offense under
24 this section. Once nonjudicial punishment has been imposed, it may
HB2118 HFLR Page 19
BOLD FACE denotes Committee Amendments.

1 not be increased, upon appeal or otherwise. When a commander or
2 officer in charge commanding officer determines that nonjudicial
3 punishment is appropriate for a particular member, all known
4 offenses determined to be appropriate for disposition by nonjudicial
5 punishment and ready to be considered at that time, including all
6 offenses arising from a single incident or course of conduct, shall
7 be considered together and shall not be made the basis for multiple
8 punishments. This subsection shall in no way restrict the right of
9 a commander commanding officer to prefer court-martial charges for
10 an offense previously punished under the provisions of this section.
11 P. In accordance with subsection B of Section 843 of this title
12 (Article 43, subsection B), a person accused of an offense is not
13 liable to be punished under this section if the offense was
