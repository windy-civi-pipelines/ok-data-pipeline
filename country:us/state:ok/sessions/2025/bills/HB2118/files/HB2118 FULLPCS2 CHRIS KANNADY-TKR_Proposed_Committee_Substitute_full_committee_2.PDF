2 punishment unjust or disproportionate to the offense may, through
3 his or her chain of command, appeal to a senior officer designated
4 by the Adjutant General to adjudicate appeals arising from
5 nonjudicial punishment. A senior officer so designated by the
6 Adjutant General shall be a member of the same component of the
7 state military forces as the accused. An appeal made pursuant to
8 this subsection shall be lodged within fifteen (15) days after the

10 officer exercising appellate authority may, at his or her
11 discretion, extend the deadline for an appeal. The appeal shall be
12 promptly forwarded and decided, and the member shall not be punished
13 until the appeal is decided. The senior officer designated by the
14 Adjutant General as exercising appellate authority may exercise the
15 same powers with respect to the punishment imposed as may be
16 exercised under subsection I of this section by the officer who
17 imposed the punishment. Before acting on an appeal from a
18 punishment, the senior officer exercising appellate authority shall
19 refer the case to a judge advocate for consideration and advice.
20 When a senior officer is designated by the Adjutant General to
21 adjudicate appeals arising from nonjudicial punishment, such
22 designation shall be accomplished in writing and shall be considered
23 a military publication, as defined in Section 801 of this title
24 (Article 1).
Req. No. 13153 Page 17

1 L. Except for nonjudicial punishment imposed by the Governor or
2 the Adjutant General, the final appellate authority for nonjudicial
3 punishment imposed within state military forces is the Adjutant
4 General. A person punished under this section whose appeal was
5 previously denied by a senior officer designated to adjudicate
6 appeals may, through his or her chain of command, lodge an
7 additional appeal with the Adjutant General within five (5) days
8 after the appeal is denied. In the event the officer imposing
9 nonjudicial punishment is a senior officer who is also designated to
10 adjudicate appeals arising from nonjudicial punishment, an appeal
11 thereof shall be addressed directly to the Adjutant General. In the
12 event the officer imposing nonjudicial punishment is the Adjutant
13 General, an appeal thereof shall be addressed directly to the
14 Governor. An appeal offered pursuant to this subsection shall be
15 made only in writing. Neither the Governor nor the Adjutant General
16 shall delegate his or her duties as an appellate authority under
17 this subsection.
18 M. Whenever nonjudicial punishment is imposed under this
19 section:
20 1. After adjudication and while the punishment is being carried
21 out or while the adjudged punishment is pending before the appellate
22 authority, the commander or officer in charge who imposed the
23 nonjudicial punishment, upon the request of the accused member, may:
24
Req. No. 13153 Page 18

1 a. excuse the accused member from attendance at scheduled
2 unit training assemblies, or
3 b. arrange for the accused member to drill on alternate
4 dates and in alternate locations; or
5 2. If necessary to maintain good order and discipline within
6 the unit, the commander or officer in charge commanding officer who
7 imposed the nonjudicial punishment may order the accused member to
8 drill on alternate dates and in alternate locations. The order
9 shall be reduced to writing and shall become part of the record of
10 nonjudicial punishment.
11 N. The imposition and enforcement of disciplinary punishment
12 under this section for any act or omission shall not be a bar to
13 trial by court-martial or a civilian court of competent jurisdiction
14 for a crime or offense arising out of the same act or omission; but
15 the fact that a disciplinary punishment has been enforced may be
16 demonstrated by the accused member upon trial and, when so
17 demonstrated, it shall be considered in determining the measure of
18 punishment to be adjudged in the event of a finding or verdict of
19 guilty. Nonjudicial punishment shall not be imposed for an offense
20 previously tried by a civilian court unless so authorized by
21 regulations promulgated by the Adjutant General.
22 O. When nonjudicial punishment has been imposed for an offense,
23 punishment shall not again be imposed for the same offense under
24 this section. Once nonjudicial punishment has been imposed, it may
Req. No. 13153 Page 19

1 not be increased, upon appeal or otherwise. When a commander or
2 officer in charge commanding officer determines that nonjudicial
3 punishment is appropriate for a particular member, all known
4 offenses determined to be appropriate for disposition by nonjudicial
5 punishment and ready to be considered at that time, including all
6 offenses arising from a single incident or course of conduct, shall
7 be considered together and shall not be made the basis for multiple
8 punishments. This subsection shall in no way restrict the right of
9 a commander commanding officer to prefer court-martial charges for
10 an offense previously punished under the provisions of this section.
11 P. In accordance with subsection B of Section 843 of this title
12 (Article 43, subsection B), a person accused of an offense is not
