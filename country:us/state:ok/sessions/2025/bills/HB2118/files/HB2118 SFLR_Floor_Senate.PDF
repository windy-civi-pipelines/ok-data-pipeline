8 K. A person punished under this section who considers the
9 punishment unjust or disproportionate to the offense may, through
10 his or her chain of command, appeal to a senior officer designated
11 by the Adjutant General to adjudicate appeals arising from

17 officer exercising appellate authority may, at his or her
18 discretion, extend the deadline for an appeal. The appeal shall be
19 promptly forwarded and decided, and the member shall not be punished
20 until the appeal is decided. The senior officer designated by the

23 exercised under subsection I of this section by the officer who
24 imposed the punishment. Before acting on an appeal from a
SENATE FLOOR VERSION - HB2118 SFLR Page 15
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)

7 (Article 1).
8 L. Except for nonjudicial punishment imposed by the Governor or

10 punishment imposed within state military forces is the Adjutant
11 General. A person punished under this section whose appeal was
12 previously denied by a senior officer designated to adjudicate
13 appeals may, through his or her chain of command, lodge an
14 additional appeal with the Adjutant General within five (5) days
15 after the appeal is denied. In the event the officer imposing
16 nonjudicial punishment is a senior officer who is also designated to
17 adjudicate appeals arising from nonjudicial punishment, an appeal
18 thereof shall be addressed directly to the Adjutant General. In the
19 event the officer imposing nonjudicial punishment is the Adjutant
20 General, an appeal thereof shall be addressed directly to the
21 Governor. An appeal offered pursuant to this subsection shall be
22 made only in writing. Neither the Governor nor the Adjutant General
23 shall delegate his or her duties as an appellate authority under
24 this subsection.

(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)

2 section:
3 1. After adjudication and while the punishment is being carried
4 out or while the adjudged punishment is pending before the appellate

6 nonjudicial punishment, upon the request of the accused member, may:
7 a. excuse the accused member from attendance at scheduled
8 unit training assemblies, or
9 b. arrange for the accused member to drill on alternate
10 dates and in alternate locations; or
11 2. If necessary to maintain good order and discipline within
12 the unit, the commander or officer in charge commanding officer who
13 imposed the nonjudicial punishment may order the accused member to
14 drill on alternate dates and in alternate locations. The order
15 shall be reduced to writing and shall become part of the record of
16 nonjudicial punishment.
17 N. The imposition and enforcement of disciplinary punishment
18 under this section for any act or omission shall not be a bar to
19 trial by court-martial or a civilian court of competent jurisdiction
20 for a crime or offense arising out of the same act or omission; but
21 the fact that a disciplinary punishment has been enforced may be
22 demonstrated by the accused member upon trial and, when so
23 demonstrated, it shall be considered in determining the measure of
24 punishment to be adjudged in the event of a finding or verdict of
SENATE FLOOR VERSION - HB2118 SFLR Page 17
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)

1 guil ty. Nonjudicial punishment shall not be imposed for an offense
2 previously tried by a civilian court unless so authorized by
3 regulations promulgated by the Adjutant General.
4 O. When nonjudicial punishment has been imposed for an offense,
5 punishment shall not again be imposed for the same offense under
6 this section. Once nonjudicial punishment has been imposed, it may
7 not be increased, upon appeal or otherwise. When a commander or
8 officer in charge commanding officer determines that nonjudicial
9 punishment is appropriate for a particular member, all known
10 offenses determined to be appropriate for disposition by nonjudicial
11 punishment and ready to be considered at that time, including all
12 offenses arising from a single incident or course of conduct, shall
13 be considered together and shall not be made the basis for multiple
14 punishments. This subsection shall in no way restrict the right of
15 a commander commanding officer to prefer court-martial charges for
16 an offense previously punished under the provisions of this section.
17 P. In accordance with subsection B of Section 843 of this title
18 (Article 43, subsection B), a person accused of an offense is not
19 liable to be punished under this section if the offense was
20 committed more than two (2) years before the imposition of
21 punishment. Periods in which the accused member is absent without
22 authority shall be excluded in computing the period of limitation
23 prescribed in this section.

6 the type and form of records to be kept of proceedings conducted
7 pursuant to this section. The Adjutant General may promulgate any
8 other regulations necessary to carry out the provisions of this
9 section.
10 S. For purposes of this section, no member of the Oklahoma
11 National Guard of the rank of E-8 or E-9 shall be reduced in rank
12 pursuant to this section except when the reduction results from
13 nonjudicial punishment imposed by an officer of the Oklahoma
14 National Guard of the rank of Brigadier General or by the Adjutant
15 General. When imposing nonjudicial punishment on enlisted persons
16 of the rank of E-7 or below, a commander or officer in charge who
17 possesses the rank of colonel may consider reduction in rank as a
18 possible punishment.
