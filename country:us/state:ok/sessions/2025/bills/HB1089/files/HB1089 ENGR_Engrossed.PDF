1 Organization licensees shall negotiate and covenant with the
2 official representative for each breed participating at any race
3 meeting as to the conditions for each race meeting, the distribution
4 of commissions and purses not governed by statutory distribution
5 formulae, simulcast transmission and reception, off-track wagering,
6 all matters relating to welfare, benefits and prerogatives of the
7 participants in the meet, and any other matter required as a matter
8 of law or necessity. During race meets at which there is more than
9 one official representative for horsemen, each official
10 representative association shall designate an equal number of
11 horsemen to serve on a single committee that will periodically meet
12 with the organization licensee to discuss and facilitate track
13 management operations. Any participating horsemen may with written
14 notice filed with the track's horsemen's bookkeeper elect to opt out
15 of representation by the above-referenced organizations. In the
16 event more than fifty percent (50%) of the total participating
17 horsemen for a single breed opt to be excluded, the Oklahoma Horse
18 Racing Commission may determine that an election be held among all
19 participating horsemen of that breed to designate an alternate
20 representative organization.
21 The official horsemen's representative organizations, and any
22 breed organizations receiving funding as a result of this act, shall
23 provide the Commission annually with a complete financial accounting
24 for the use of all funds received pursuant to this act. The
