An Act relating to amusements and sports; amending 3A
O.S. 2021, Section 267, which relates to horse
racing; modifying what organization licensees shall

SUBJECT: Amusements and sports
BE IT ENACTED BY THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF OKLAHOMA:
SECTION 1. AMENDATORY 3A O.S. 2021, Section 267, is
amended to read as follows:
Section 267. For purposes of this act, the organization elected
by horsemen that was, in 2003, providing representation for
participating Thoroughbred horsemen at meets restricted to
Thoroughbred horses only shall be the official representative of all
Thoroughbreds participating in live race meets conducted by an
organization licensee. The organization elected by horsemen that
was, in 2003, providing representation for the breeds participating
in mixed-breed racing shall be the official representative of all
non-Thoroughbreds participating in live race meets conducted by an
organization licensee.
Organization licensees shall negotiate and covenant with the
official representative for each breed participating at any race
meeting as to the conditions for each race meeting, the distribution
of commissions and purses not governed by statutory distribution
formulae, simulcast transmission and reception, off-track wagering,
all matters relating to welfare, benefits and prerogatives of the
participants in the meet, and any other matter required as a matter

of law or necessity. During race meets at which there is more than
one official representative for horsemen, each official
representative association shall designate an equal number of
horsemen to serve on a single committee that will periodically meet
with the organization licensee to discuss and facilitate track
management operations. Any participating horsemen may with written
notice filed with the track's horsemen's bookkeeper elect to opt out
of representation by the above-referenced organizations. In the
event more than fifty percent (50%) of the total participating
horsemen for a single breed opt to be excluded, the Oklahoma Horse
Racing Commission may determine that an election be held among all
participating horsemen of that breed to designate an alternate
representative organization.
The official horsemen's representative organizations, and any
breed organizations receiving funding as a result of this act, shall
provide the Commission annually with a complete financial accounting
for the use of all funds received pursuant to this act. The
official horsemen's representative organization shall administer the
benevolence program for participants in each live race meeting and a
complete accounting of those funds along with the guidelines for
administration and determination of eligibility for the benevolence
program are subject to approval by the Commission.
SECTION 2. This act shall become effective November 1, 2025.
