17 recall repairs which shall include diagnostic work as
18 applicable and assistance requested by a consumer
19 whose vehicle was subjected to an over-the-air or
20 remote change, repair, or update to any part, system,

22 performed by the dealer in order to satisfy the
23 consumer. Time allowances for the diagnosis and
24 performance of repair work shall be reasonable and
Req. No. 1702 Page 30

1 adequate for the work to be performed. Adequate and
2 fair compensation, which under this provision shall be
3 no less than the rates customarily charged for retail
4 consumer repairs as calculated herein, for parts and
5 labor for warranty and recall repairs shall, at the
6 option of the new motor vehicle dealer, be established
7 by the new motor vehicle dealer submitting to the
8 manufacturer or distributor one hundred sequential
9 nonwarranty consumer-paid service repair orders which
10 contain warranty-like repairs, or ninety (90)
11 consecutive days of nonwarranty consumer-paid service
12 repair orders which contain warranty-like repairs,
13 whichever is less, covering repairs made no more than
14 one hundred eighty (180) days before the submission
15 and declaring the average percentage labor rate and/or
16 markup rate. A motor vehicle dealer may not submit a
17 request to establish its retail rates more than once
18 in a twelve-month period. That request may establish
19 a parts markup rate, labor rate, or both. The new
20 motor vehicle dealer or new powersports vehicle dealer
21 shall calculate its retail parts rate by determining
22 the total charges for parts from the qualified repair
23 orders submitted, dividing that amount by the new
24 motor vehicle dealer’s total cost of the purchase of
Req. No. 1702 Page 31

1 those parts, subtracting one (1), and multiplying by
2 one hundred (100) to produce a percentage. The new
3 motor vehicle dealer or new powersports vehicle dealer
4 shall calculate its retail labor rate by dividing the
5 amount of the new vehicle dealer’s total labor sales
6 from the qualified repair orders by the total labor
7 hours charged for those sales. When submitting repair
8 orders to establish a retail parts and labor rate, a
9 new motor vehicle dealer or new powersports vehicle
10 dealer need not include repairs for:
11 (1) routine maintenance including but not limited to
12 the replacement of bulbs, fluids, filters,
13 batteries, and belts that are not provided in the
14 course of and related to a repair,
15 (2) factory special events, specials, or promotional
16 discounts for retail consumer repairs,
17 (3) parts sold or repairs performed at wholesale,
18 (4) factory-approved goodwill or policy repairs or
19 replacements,
20 (5) repairs with aftermarket parts, when calculating
21 the retail parts rate but not the retail labor
22 rate,
23 (6) repairs on aftermarket parts,
24
Req. No. 1702 Page 32

1 (7) replacement of or work on tires including front-
2 end alignments and wheel or tire rotations,
3 (8) repairs of vehicles owned by the new motor
4 vehicle dealer or new powersports vehicle dealer
5 or employee thereof at the time of the repair,
6 (9) vehicle reconditioning, or
7 (10) items that do not have individual part numbers
8 including, but not limited to, nuts, bolts, and
9 fasteners.
10 A manufacturer or distributor may, not later than
11 forty-five (45) days after submission, rebut that
12 declared retail parts and labor rate in writing by
13 reasonably substantiating that the rate is not
14 accurate or is incomplete pursuant to the provisions
15 of this section. If the manufacturer or distributor
16 determines the set of repair orders submitted by the
17 new motor vehicle dealer or new powersports vehicle
18 dealer pursuant to this section for a retail labor
19 rate or retail parts markup rate is substantially
20 higher than the new vehicle dealer’s current warranty
21 rates, the manufacturer or distributor may request, in
22 writing, within forty-five (45) days after the
23 manufacturer’s or distributor’s receipt of the new
24 vehicle dealer’s initial submission, all repair orders
Req. No. 1702 Page 33

1 closed within the period of thirty (30) days
2 immediately preceding, or thirty (30) days immediately
3 following, the set of repair orders initially
4 submitted by the new motor vehicle dealer. All time
5 periods under this section shall be suspended until
6 the supplemental repair orders are provided. If the
7 manufacturer or distributor requests supplemental
8 repair orders, the manufacturer or distributor may,
9 within thirty (30) days after receiving the
10 supplemental repair orders and in accordance with the
11 formula described in this subsection, calculate a
12 proposed adjusted retail labor rate or retail parts
13 markup rate, as applicable, based upon any set of the
14 qualified repair orders submitted by the franchisee
15 and following the formula set forth herein to
16 establish the rate. The retail labor and parts rates
17 shall go into effect thirty (30) days following the
18 approval by the manufacturer or distributor. If the
19 declared rate is rebutted, the manufacturer or
20 distributor shall provide written notice stating the
21 reasons for the rebuttal, an explanation of the
22 reasons for the rebuttal, and a copy of all
23 calculations used by the franchisor in determining the
24 manufacturer or distributor’s position and propose an
Req. No. 1702 Page 34

1 adjustment in writing of the average percentage markup
2 or labor rate based on that rebuttal not later than
3 forty-five (45) days after submission. If the new
4 motor vehicle dealer or new powersports vehicle dealer
5 does not agree with the proposed average percentage
6 markup or labor rate, the new vehicle dealer may file
7 a protest with the Commission not later than thirty
8 (30) days after receipt of that proposal by the
9 manufacturer or distributor. In the event a protest
10 is filed, the manufacturer or distributor shall have
11 the burden of proof to establish the new vehicle
12 dealer’s submitted parts markup rate or labor rate was
13 inaccurate or not complete pursuant to the provisions
14 of this section. A manufacturer or distributor may
15 not retaliate against any new motor vehicle dealer or
16 new powersports vehicle dealer seeking to exercise its
17 rights under this section. A manufacturer or
18 distributor may require a dealer to submit repair
19 orders in accordance with this section in order to
20 validate the reasonableness of a dealer’s retail rate
21 for parts or labor not more often than once every
22 twelve (12) months. A manufacturer or distributor may
23 not otherwise recover its costs from new vehicle
24 dealers within this state including a surcharge
Req. No. 1702 Page 35

1 imposed on a new motor vehicle dealer solely intended
2 to recover the cost of reimbursing a dealer for parts
3 and labor pursuant to this section; provided, a
4 manufacturer or distributor shall not be prohibited
5 from increasing prices for vehicles or parts in the
6 normal course of business or from auditing and
7 charging back claims in accordance with this section.
8 All claims made by dealers for compensation for
9 delivery, preparation, warranty, or recall repair work
10 shall be paid within thirty (30) days after approval
11 and shall be approved or disapproved within thirty
12 (30) days after receipt. When any claim is
13 disapproved, the dealer shall be notified in writing
14 of the grounds for disapproval. The dealer’s
15 delivery, preparation, and warranty obligations as
16 filed with the Commission shall constitute the
17 dealer’s sole responsibility for product liability as
18 between the dealer and manufacturer. A factory may
19 reasonably and periodically audit a new motor vehicle
20 dealer or new powersports vehicle dealer to determine
21 the validity of paid claims for dealer compensation or
22 any charge-backs for warranty parts or service
23 compensation. Except in cases of suspected fraud,
24 audits of warranty payments shall only be for the one-
Req. No. 1702 Page 36

1 year period immediately following the date of the
2 payment. A manufacturer shall reserve the right to
3 reasonable, periodic audits to determine the validity
4 of paid claims for dealer compensation or any charge-
5 backs for consumer or dealer incentives. Except in
6 cases of suspected fraud, audits of incentive payments
7 shall only be for a one-year period immediately
8 following the date of the payment. A factory shall
9 not deny a claim or charge a new motor vehicle dealer
10 back subsequent to the payment of the claim unless the
11 factory can show that the claim was false or
12 fraudulent or that the new motor vehicle dealer or new
13 powersports vehicle dealer failed to reasonably
14 substantiate the claim by the written reasonable
15 procedures of the factory. A factory shall not deny a
16 claim or implement a charge-back against a new vehicle
17 dealer after payment of a claim in the event a
18 purchaser of a new vehicle that is the subject of a
19 claim fails to comply with titling or registration
20 laws of this state and is not prevented from
21 compliance by any action of the dealer; provided, that
22 the factory may require the dealer to provide, within
23 thirty (30) days of notice of charge-back, withholding
24 of payment, or denial of claim, the documentation to
Req. No. 1702 Page 37

1 demonstrate the vehicle sale, delivery, and customer
2 qualification for an incentive as reported, including
3 consumer name and address and written attestation
4 signed by the dealer operator or general manager
5 stating the consumer was not on the export control
6 list and the dealer did not know or have reason to
7 know the vehicle was being exported or resold.
8 The factory shall provide written notice to a dealer
9 of a proposed charge-back that is the result of an
10 audit along with the specific audit results and
11 proposed charge-back amount. A dealer that receives
12 notice of a proposed charge-back pursuant to a
13 factory’s audit has the right to file a protest with
14 the Commission within thirty (30) days after receipt
15 of the notice of the charge-back or audit results,
16 whichever is later. The factory is prohibited from
17 implementing the charge-back or debiting the dealer’s
18 account until either the time frame for filing a
19 protest has passed or a final adjudication is rendered
20 by the Commission, whichever is later, unless the
21 dealer has agreed to the charge-back or charge-backs,
22 c. fails to compensate the new motor vehicle dealer for a
23 used motor vehicle:
24
Req. No. 1702 Page 38

1 (1) that is of the same make and model manufactured,
2 imported, or distributed by the factory and is a
3 line-make that the new motor vehicle dealer is
4 franchised to sell or on which the new motor
5 vehicle dealer is authorized to perform recall
6 repairs,
7 (2) that is subject to a stop-sale or do-not-drive
8 order issued by the factory or an authorized
9 governmental agency,
10 (3) that is held by the new motor vehicle dealer in
11 the dealer’s inventory at the time the stop-sale
12 or do-not-drive order is issued or that is taken
13 by the new motor vehicle dealer into the dealer’s
14 inventory after the recall notice as a result of
15 a retail consumer trade-in or a lease return to
16 the dealer inventory in accordance with an
17 applicable lease contract,
18 (4) that cannot be repaired due to the
19 unavailability, within thirty (30) days after
20 issuance of the stop-sale or do-not-drive order,
21 of a remedy or parts necessary for the new motor
22 vehicle dealer to make the recall repair, and
23 (5) that is not at least in the prorated amount of
24 one percent (1.00%) of the value of the vehicle
Req. No. 1702 Page 39

1 per month beginning on the date that is thirty
2 (30) days after the date on which the stop-sale
3 order was provided to the new motor vehicle
4 dealer until the earlier of either of the
5 following:
6 (a) the date the recall remedy or parts are made
7 available, or
8 (b) the date the new motor vehicle dealer sells,
9 trades, or otherwise disposes of the
10 affected used motor vehicle.
11 For the purposes of division (5) of this subparagraph,
12 the value of a used vehicle shall be the average Black
13 Book value for the year, make, and model of the
14 recalled vehicle. A factory may direct the manner and
15 method in which a new motor vehicle dealer must
16 demonstrate the inventory status of an affected used
17 motor vehicle to determine eligibility under this
18 subparagraph; provided, that the manner and method may
19 not be unduly burdensome and may not require
20 information that is unduly burdensome to provide. All
21 reimbursement claims made by new motor vehicle dealers
22 pursuant to this section for recall remedies or
23 repairs, or for compensation where no part or repair
24 is reasonably available and the vehicle is subject to
Req. No. 1702 Page 40

1 a stop-sale or do-not-drive order, shall be subject to
2 the same limitations and requirements as a warranty
3 reimbursement claim made under subparagraph b of this
4 paragraph. In the alternative, a manufacturer may
5 compensate its franchised new motor vehicle dealers
6 under a national recall compensation program;
7 provided, the compensation under the program is equal
8 to or greater than that provided under division (5) of
9 this subparagraph, or as the manufacturer and new
10 motor vehicle dealer otherwise agree. Nothing in this
11 section shall require a factory to provide total
12 compensation to a new motor vehicle dealer which would
13 exceed the total average Black Book value of the
14 affected used motor vehicle as originally determined
15 under division (5) of this subparagraph. Any remedy
16 provided to a new motor vehicle dealer under this
17 subparagraph is exclusive and may not be combined with
18 any other state or federal compensation remedy,
19 d. unreasonably fails or refuses to offer to its same
20 line-make franchised dealers a reasonable supply and
21 mix of all models manufactured for that line-make, or
22 unreasonably requires a dealer to pay any extra fee,
23 purchase unreasonable advertising displays or other
24 materials, or enter into a separate agreement which
Req. No. 1702 Page 41

1 adversely alters the rights or obligations contained
2 within the dealer’s existing franchise agreement or
3 which waives any right of the new motor vehicle dealer
4 or new powersports vehicle dealer as protected by
5 Section 561 et seq. of this title, or remodel,
6 renovate, or recondition the dealer’s existing
7 facilities as a prerequisite to receiving a model or
8 series of vehicles, except as may be necessary to sell
9 or service the model or series of vehicles as provided
10 by subparagraph e of this paragraph. It shall be a
11 violation of this section for new vehicle allocation
12 to be withheld subject to any requirement to purchase
13 or sell any number of used or off-lease vehicles. The
14 failure to deliver any such new motor vehicle shall
15 not be considered a violation of the section if the
16 failure is not arbitrary or is due to lack of
17 manufacturing capacity or to a strike or labor
18 difficulty, a shortage of materials, a freight
19 embargo, or other cause over which the manufacturer
20 has no control. However, this subparagraph shall not
21 apply to limited production model vehicles, a vehicle
22 not advertised by the factory for sale in this state,
23 vehicles that are subject to allocation affected by
24 federal environmental laws or environmental laws of
Req. No. 1702 Page 42

4 law, or to comply with a technology requirement which
5 is necessary to sell or service a vehicle that the
6 franchised new motor vehicle dealer or new powersports
7 vehicle dealer is authorized or licensed by the
8 franchisor to sell or service, requires a dealer to
9 construct a new facility or substantially renovate the
10 dealer’s existing facility unless the facility
11 construction or renovation is justified by the
12 economic conditions existing at the time, as well as
13 the reasonably foreseeable projections, in the new
14 motor vehicle dealer’s market and in the automotive
15 industry. However, this subparagraph shall not apply
16 if the new motor vehicle dealer or new powersports
17 vehicle dealer voluntarily agrees to facility
18 construction or renovation in exchange for money,
19 credit, allowance, reimbursement, or additional
20 vehicle allocation to a dealer from the factory to
21 compensate the dealer for the cost of, or a portion of
22 the cost of, the facility construction or renovation.

9 has been constructed or substantially altered within
10 the last ten (10) years and the construction or
11 alteration was approved by the manufacturer as a part
12 of a facility upgrade program, standard, or policy.
13 For purposes of this subparagraph, “substantially
14 altered” means to perform an alteration that
15 substantially impacts the architectural features,
16 characteristics, or integrity of a structure or lot.
17 The term shall not include routine maintenance
18 reasonably necessary to maintain a dealership in
19 attractive condition. If a facility upgrade program,
20 standard, or policy under which the dealer completed a
21 facility construction or substantial alteration does
22 not contain a specific time period during which the
23 manufacturer or distributor shall provide payments or
24 benefits to a participating dealer, or the time frame
Req. No. 1702 Page 44

1 specified under the program is reduced or canceled
2 prematurely in the unilateral discretion of the
3 manufacturer or distributor, the manufacturer or
4 distributor shall not deny the participating dealer
5 any payment or benefit under the terms of the program,
6 standard, or policy as it existed when the dealer
7 began to perform under the program, standard, or
8 policy for the balance of the ten-year period,
9 regardless of whether the manufacturer’s or
10 distributor’s program, standard, or policy has been
11 changed or canceled, unless the manufacturer and
12 dealer agree, in writing, to the change in payment or
13 benefit,
14 f. requires a new motor vehicle dealer or new powersports
15 vehicle dealer to establish an exclusive facility,
16 unless supported by reasonable business, market, and
17 economic considerations; provided, that this section
18 shall not restrict the terms of any agreement for such
19 exclusive facility voluntarily entered into and
20 supported by valuable consideration separate from the
21 new motor vehicle dealer’s right to sell and service
22 motor vehicles for the franchisor,
23 g. requires a new motor vehicle dealer or new powersports
24 vehicle dealer to enter into a site-control agreement
Req. No. 1702 Page 45

1 covering any or all of the new motor vehicle dealer’s
2 facilities or premises; provided, that this section
3 shall not restrict the terms of any site-control
4 agreement voluntarily entered into and supported by
5 valuable consideration separate from the new motor
6 vehicle dealer’s right to sell and service motor
7 vehicles for the franchisor. Notwithstanding the
8 foregoing or the terms of any site-control agreement,
9 a site-control agreement automatically extinguishes if
10 all of the factory’s franchises that operated from the
11 location that are the subject of the site-control
12 agreement are terminated by the factory as part of the
13 discontinuance of a product line,
14 h. refuses to pay, or claims reimbursement from, a new
15 motor vehicle dealer or new powersports vehicle dealer
16 for sales, incentives, or other payments related to a
17 vehicle sold by the dealer because the purchaser of
18 the new vehicle exported or resold the vehicle in
19 violation of the policy of the factory unless the
20 factory can show that, at the time of the sale, the
21 new vehicle dealer knew or reasonably should have
22 known of the purchaser’s intention to export or resell
23 the vehicle. There is a rebuttable presumption that
24 the new vehicle dealer did not know or could not have
Req. No. 1702 Page 46

1 known that the vehicle would be exported if the
2 vehicle is titled and registered in any state of the
3 United States, or
4 i. (1) notwithstanding the terms of a franchise
5 agreement or other agreement providing otherwise,
6 requires a new motor vehicle dealer or new
7 powersports vehicle dealer to purchase or utilize
8 goods or services, or contract with any vendor,
9 identified, selected, or designated by the
10 factory for the:
11 (a) operation of the dealership, including
12 electronic services such as websites, data
13 management or storage systems, digital
14 retail platforms, software, or other digital
15 services or platforms, or
16 (b) construction, renovation, or improvement of
17 the new dealer’s facility from a vendor
18 chosen by the factory if goods or services
19 available from other sources a vendor that
20 the new motor vehicle dealer chooses are of
21 substantially similar quality and design and
22 comply with all applicable laws; provided,
23 however, that such goods are not subject to
24 the factory’s intellectual property or
Req. No. 1702 Page 47

1 trademark rights and the new vehicle dealer
2 has received the factory’s approval, which
3 approval may not be unreasonably withheld.
4 Nothing in this subparagraph may be
5 construed to allow a new motor vehicle
6 dealer or new powersports vehicle dealer to
7 impair or eliminate a factory’s intellectual
8 property, trademark rights, or trade dress
9 usage guidelines. Nothing in this section
10 prohibits the enforcement of a voluntary
11 agreement between the factory and the new
12 vehicle dealer where separate and valuable
13 consideration has been offered and accepted
14 It is a violation of this division for a factory, or
15 any entity that operates on behalf of a factory, to
16 coerce a new motor vehicle dealer to purchase or
17 utilize certain goods or services by the withholding
18 of monetary incentives paid on a per vehicle basis and
19 vehicle allocation that the new motor vehicle dealer
20 is otherwise eligible to receive, and
21 (2) for the purposes of this subparagraph, “goods and
22 services” do not include:
23 (a) moveable displays, brochures, or promotional
24 materials containing material subject to the
Req. No. 1702 Page 48

1 intellectual property rights of a factory or
2 parts to be used in repairs under warranty
3 obligations of a factory, or
4 (b) special tools or training required by the
5 factory to perform warranty or recall
6 related repairs;
7 10. Being a factory that:
8 a. establishes a system of motor vehicle allocation or
9 distribution which is unfair, inequitable, or
10 unreasonably discriminatory. Upon the request of any
11 new motor vehicle dealer or new powersports vehicle
12 dealer franchised by it, a factory shall disclose in
13 writing to the dealer the basis upon which new
14 vehicles are allocated, scheduled, and delivered among
15 the new motor vehicle dealers of the same line-make
16 for that factory, or
17 b. changes an established plan or system of new motor
18 vehicle or new powersports vehicle distribution. A
19 new motor vehicle dealer or new powersports vehicle
20 dealer franchise agreement shall continue in full
21 force and operation notwithstanding a change, in whole
22 or in part, of an established plan or system of
23 distribution of the motor vehicles or new powersports
24 vehicles offered or previously offered for sale under
Req. No. 1702 Page 49

1 the franchise agreement. The appointment of a new
2 importer or distributor for motor vehicles or new
3 powersports vehicle offered for sale under the
4 franchise agreement shall be deemed to be a change of
5 an established plan or system of distribution. The
6 discontinuation of a line-make shall not be deemed to
7 be a change of an established plan or system of motor
8 vehicle or new powersports vehicle distribution. The
9 creation of a line-make shall not be deemed to be a
10 change of an established plan or system of motor
11 vehicle distribution as long as the new line-make is
12 not selling the same, or substantially the same
13 vehicle or vehicles previously sold through another
14 line-make by new motor vehicle dealers or new
15 powersports vehicle dealers with an active franchise
16 agreement for the other line-make in the state if such
17 dealers are no longer authorized to sell the
18 comparable vehicle previously sold through their line-
19 make. Changing a vehicle’s powertrain is not
20 sufficient to show it is substantially different.
21 Upon the occurrence of such change, the manufacturer
22 or distributor shall be prohibited from obtaining a
23 license to distribute vehicles under the new plan or
24 system of distribution unless the manufacturer or
Req. No. 1702 Page 50

1 distributor offers to each vehicle dealer who is a
2 party to the franchise agreement a new franchise
3 agreement containing substantially the same provisions
4 which were contained in the previous franchise
5 agreement;
6 11. Being a factory that sells directly or indirectly new motor
7 vehicles or new powersports vehicles to any retail consumer in the
8 state except through a new motor vehicle dealer or new powersports
9 vehicle dealer holding a franchise for the line-make that includes
10 the new motor vehicle or new powersports vehicle. This paragraph
11 does not apply to factory sales of new vehicles to its employees,
12 family members of employees, retirees and family members of
13 retirees, not-for-profit organizations, or the federal, state, or
14 local governments. The provisions of this paragraph shall not
15 preclude a factory from providing information to a consumer for the
16 purpose of marketing or facilitating a sale of a new vehicle or from
17 establishing a program to sell or offer to sell new motor vehicles
18 or new powersports vehicle through participating dealers subject to
19 the limitations provided in paragraph 2 of Section 562 of this
20 title;
21 12. a. Being a factory which directly or indirectly:
22 (1) owns any ownership interest or has any financial
23 interest in a new motor vehicle dealer or new
24 powersports vehicle dealer or any person who
Req. No. 1702 Page 51

1 sells products or services pursuant to the terms
2 of the franchise agreement,
3 (2) operates or controls a new motor vehicle dealer
4 or new powersports vehicle dealer, or
5 (3) acts in the capacity of a new motor vehicle
6 dealer or new powersports vehicle dealer.
7 b. (1) This paragraph does not prohibit a factory from
8 owning or controlling a new motor vehicle dealer
9 or new powersports vehicle dealer while in a bona
10 fide relationship with a dealer development
11 candidate who has made a substantial initial
12 investment in the franchise and whose initial
13 investment is subject to potential loss. The
14 dealer development candidate can reasonably
15 expect to acquire full ownership of a new vehicle
16 dealer within a reasonable period of time not to
17 exceed ten (10) years and on reasonable terms and
18 conditions. The ten-year acquisition period may
19 be expanded for good cause shown.
20 (2) This paragraph does not prohibit a factory from
21 owning, operating, controlling, or acting in the
22 capacity of a new motor vehicle dealer or new
23 powersports vehicle dealer for a period not to
24 exceed twelve (12) months during the transition
Req. No. 1702 Page 52

1 from one independent dealer to another
2 independent dealer if the dealership is for sale
3 at a reasonable price and on reasonable terms and
4 conditions to an independent qualified buyer. On
5 showing by a factory of good cause, the Oklahoma
6 New Motor Vehicle Commission may extend the time
7 limit set forth above; extensions may be granted
8 for periods not to exceed twelve (12) months.
9 (3) This paragraph does not prohibit a factory from
10 owning, operating, or controlling or acting in
11 the capacity of a new motor vehicle dealer or new
12 powersports vehicle dealer which was in operation
13 prior to January 1, 2000.
14 (4) This paragraph does not prohibit a factory from
15 owning, directly or indirectly, a minority
16 interest in an entity that owns, operates, or
17 controls motor vehicle dealerships or powersports
18 vehicle dealerships of the same line-make
19 franchised by the manufacturer, provided that
20 each of the following conditions are met:
21 (a) all of the new motor vehicle or new
22 powersports vehicle dealerships selling the
23 vehicles of that manufacturer in this state
24
Req. No. 1702 Page 53

1 trade exclusively in the line-make of that
2 manufacturer,
3 (b) all of the franchise agreements of the
4 manufacturer confer rights on the dealer of
5 the line-make to develop and operate, within
6 a defined geographic territory or area, as
7 many dealership facilities as the dealer and
8 manufacturer shall agree are appropriate,
9 (c) at the time the manufacturer first acquires
10 an ownership interest or assumes operation,
11 the distance between any dealership thus
12 owned or operated and the nearest
13 unaffiliated new motor vehicle or new
14 powersports vehicle dealership trading in
15 the same line-make is not less than seventy
16 (70) miles,
17 (d) during any period in which the manufacturer
18 has such an ownership interest, the
19 manufacturer has no more than three
20 franchise agreements with new motor vehicle
21 dealers or new powersports vehicle dealers
22 licensed by the Oklahoma New Motor Vehicle
23 Commission to do business within the state,

Req. No. 1702 Page 54

1 (e) prior to January 1, 2000, the factory shall

9 may from time to time seek to own or
10 acquire, directly or indirectly, ownership
11 interests in retail dealerships;
12 13. Being a factory which directly or indirectly makes
13 available for public disclosure any proprietary information provided
14 to the factory by a new motor vehicle dealer or new powersports
15 vehicle dealer, other than in composite form to new vehicle dealers
16 in the same line-make or in response to a subpoena or order of the
17 Commission or a court. Proprietary information includes, but is not
18 limited to, information:
19 a. derived from monthly financial statements provided to
20 the factory, and

22 particular new motor vehicle dealer or new powersports
23 vehicle dealer;
24
Req. No. 1702 Page 55

1 14. Being a factory which does not provide or direct leads in a
2 fair, equitable, and timely manner. Nothing in this paragraph shall
3 be construed to require a factory to disregard the preference of a

6 vehicle dealer or new powersports vehicle dealer for the purpose of
7 unfairly competing with dealers;

9 or new powersports vehicle dealer from relocating after a written
10 request by such dealer if:

15 forth in subparagraphs f and g of paragraph 9 of this
16 subsection,
17 b. the proposed new location is within the area of
18 responsibility of the new motor vehicle dealer or new

3 17. Being a factory which prohibits a new motor vehicle dealer
4 or new powersports vehicle dealer from adding additional line-makes
5 to its existing facility, if, after adding the additional line-
6 makes, the facility satisfies the written reasonable capitalization

8 facility guidelines do not include a requirement to maintain
9 exclusivity or site control unless agreed to by the dealer as set
10 forth in subparagraphs f and g of paragraph 9 of this subsection;
11 18. Being a factory that increases prices of new motor vehicles
12 or new powersports vehicles which the dealer had ordered for retail
13 consumers and notified the factory prior to the dealer’s receipt of
14 the written official price increase notification. A sales contract
