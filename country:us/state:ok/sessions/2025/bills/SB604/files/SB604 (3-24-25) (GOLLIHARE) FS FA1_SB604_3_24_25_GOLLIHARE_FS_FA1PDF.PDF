9 integrator or other third party that the dealer wishes to be an
10 authorized integrator. For the purposes of this subsection,
11 “unreasonable restriction” includes:
12 1. Imposing an access fee on a dealer or authorized integrator;
13 however, a franchisor or third party may charge a franchise or

1 5. Requiring unreasonable access to an authorized integrator’s
2 sensitive, competitive, or other confidential business information
3 as a condition for accessing protected dealer data or sharing
4 protected dealer data with an authorized integrator.
5 Notwithstanding paragraph 1 of this subsection, a factory or entity
6 that acts on behalf of a factory, including any subsidiary or
7 affiliate of a factory, may charge a motor vehicle dealer or
8 authorized integrator for costs associated with modifications to a
9 franchisor’s electronic systems to enable a functional and secure
10 interface with the authorized integrator’s system and software.

9 accountable,

1 new motor vehicle dealer’s region for the rental of a
2 substantially similar make and model as the vehicle
3 being serviced, or
4 g. failed to make available to its new motor vehicle

2 Commission which must be found by the Commission to be
3 reasonable, or has failed to adequately and fairly
4 compensate its dealers for labor, parts, and other
5 expenses incurred by the dealer to perform under and
6 comply with manufacturer’s warranty agreements and
7 recall repairs which shall include diagnostic work as
8 applicable and assistance requested by a consumer
9 whose vehicle was subjected to an over-the-air or
10 remote change, repair, or update to any part, system,
11 accessory, or function by the manufacturer and
12 performed by the dealer in order to satisfy the
13 consumer. Time allowances for the diagnosis and

16 fair compensation, which under this provision shall be
17 no less than the rates customarily charged for retail
18 consumer repairs as calculated herein, for parts and
19 labor for warranty and recall repairs shall, at the
20 option of the new motor vehicle dealer, be established
21 by the new motor vehicle dealer submitting to the
22 manufacturer or distributor one hundred sequential
23 nonwarranty consumer-paid service repair orders which
24 contain warranty-like repairs, or ninety (90)
Req. No. 1879 Page 31

1 consecutive days of nonwarranty consumer-paid service
2 repair orders which contain warranty-like repairs,
3 whichever is less, covering repairs made no more than
4 one hundred eighty (180) days before the submission
5 and declaring the average percentage labor rate and/or
6 markup rate. A motor vehicle dealer may not submit a
7 request to establish its retail rates more than once
8 in a twelve-month period. That request may establish
9 a parts markup rate, labor rate, or both. The new
10 motor vehicle dealer or new powersports vehicle dealer
11 shall calculate its retail parts rate by determining
12 the total charges for parts from the qualified repair
13 orders submitted, dividing that amount by the new
14 motor vehicle dealer’s total cost of the purchase of
15 those parts, subtracting one (1), and multiplying by
16 one hundred (100) to produce a percentage. The new
17 motor vehicle dealer or new powersports vehicle dealer
18 shall calculate its retail labor rate by dividing the
19 amount of the new vehicle dealer’s total labor sales
20 from the qualified repair orders by the total labor
21 hours charged for those sales. When submitting repair
22 orders to establish a retail parts and labor rate, a
23 new motor vehicle dealer or new powersports vehicle
24 dealer need not include repairs for:
Req. No. 1879 Page 32

1 (1) routine maintenance including but not limited to
2 the replacement of bulbs, fluids, filters,
3 batteries, and belts that are not provided in the
4 course of and related to a repair,
5 (2) factory special events, specials, or promotional
6 discounts for retail consumer repairs,
7 (3) parts sold or repairs performed at wholesale,
8 (4) factory-approved goodwill or policy repairs or
9 replacements,
10 (5) repairs with aftermarket parts, when calculating
11 the retail parts rate but not the retail labor
12 rate,
13 (6) repairs on aftermarket parts,
14 (7) replacement of or work on tires including front-
15 end alignments and wheel or tire rotations,
16 (8) repairs of vehicles owned by the new motor
17 vehicle dealer or new powersports vehicle dealer
18 or employee thereof at the time of the repair,
19 (9) vehicle reconditioning, or
20 (10) items that do not have individual part numbers
21 including, but not limited to, nuts, bolts, and
22 fasteners.
23 A manufacturer or distributor may, not later than
24 forty-five (45) days after submission, rebut that
Req. No. 1879 Page 33

1 declared retail parts and labor rate in writing by
2 reasonably substantiating that the rate is not
3 accurate or is incomplete pursuant to the provisions
4 of this section. If the manufacturer or distributor
5 determines the set of repair orders submitted by the
6 new motor vehicle dealer or new powersports vehicle
7 dealer pursuant to this section for a retail labor
8 rate or retail parts markup rate is substantially
9 higher than the new vehicle dealer’s current warranty
10 rates, the manufacturer or distributor may request, in
11 writing, within forty-five (45) days after the
12 manufacturer’s or distributor’s receipt of the new
13 vehicle dealer’s initial submission, all repair orders
14 closed within the period of thirty (30) days
15 immediately preceding, or thirty (30) days immediately
16 following, the set of repair orders initially
17 submitted by the new motor vehicle dealer. All time
18 periods under this section shall be suspended until
19 the supplemental repair orders are provided. If the
20 manufacturer or distributor requests supplemental
21 repair orders, the manufacturer or distributor may,
22 within thirty (30) days after receiving the
23 supplemental repair orders and in accordance with the
24 formula described in this subsection, calculate a
Req. No. 1879 Page 34

1 proposed adjusted retail labor rate or retail parts
2 markup rate, as applicable, based upon any set of the
3 qualified repair orders submitted by the franchisee
4 and following the formula set forth herein to
5 establish the rate. The retail labor and parts rates
6 shall go into effect thirty (30) days following the
7 approval by the manufacturer or distributor. If the
8 declared rate is rebutted, the manufacturer or
9 distributor shall provide written notice stating the
10 reasons for the rebuttal, an explanation of the
11 reasons for the rebuttal, and a copy of all
12 calculations used by the franchisor in determining the
13 manufacturer or distributor’s position and propose an
14 adjustment in writing of the average percentage markup
15 or labor rate based on that rebuttal not later than
16 forty-five (45) days after submission. If the new
17 motor vehicle dealer or new powersports vehicle dealer
18 does not agree with the proposed average percentage
19 markup or labor rate, the new vehicle dealer may file
20 a protest with the Commission not later than thirty
21 (30) days after receipt of that proposal by the
22 manufacturer or distributor. In the event a protest
23 is filed, the manufacturer or distributor shall have
24 the burden of proof to establish the new vehicle
Req. No. 1879 Page 35

1 dealer’s submitted parts markup rate or labor rate was
2 inaccurate or not complete pursuant to the provisions
3 of this section. A manufacturer or distributor may
4 not retaliate against any new motor vehicle dealer or
5 new powersports vehicle dealer seeking to exercise its
6 rights under this section. A manufacturer or
7 distributor may require a dealer to submit repair
8 orders in accordance with this section in order to
9 validate the reasonableness of a dealer’s retail rate
10 for parts or labor not more often than once every
11 twelve (12) months. A manufacturer or distributor may
12 not otherwise recover its costs from new vehicle
13 dealers within this state including a surcharge
14 imposed on a new motor vehicle dealer solely intended
15 to recover the cost of reimbursing a dealer for parts
16 and labor pursuant to this section; provided, a
17 manufacturer or distributor shall not be prohibited
18 from increasing prices for vehicles or parts in the
19 normal course of business or from auditing and
20 charging back claims in accordance with this section.
21 All claims made by dealers for compensation for
22 delivery, preparation, warranty, or recall repair work
23 shall be paid within thirty (30) days after approval
24 and shall be approved or disapproved within thirty
Req. No. 1879 Page 36

1 (30) days after receipt. When any claim is
2 disapproved, the dealer shall be notified in writing
3 of the grounds for disapproval. The dealer’s
4 delivery, preparation, and warranty obligations as
5 filed with the Commission shall constitute the
6 dealer’s sole responsibility for product liability as
7 between the dealer and manufacturer. A factory may
8 reasonably and periodically audit a new motor vehicle
9 dealer or new powersports vehicle dealer to determine
10 the validity of paid claims for dealer compensation or
11 any charge-backs for warranty parts or service
12 compensation. Except in cases of suspected fraud,
13 audits of warranty payments shall only be for the one-
14 year period immediately following the date of the
15 payment. A manufacturer shall reserve the right to
16 reasonable, periodic audits to determine the validity
17 of paid claims for dealer compensation or any charge-
18 backs for consumer or dealer incentives. Except in
19 cases of suspected fraud, audits of incentive payments
20 shall only be for a one-year period immediately
21 following the date of the payment. A factory shall
22 not deny a claim or charge a new motor vehicle dealer
23 back subsequent to the payment of the claim unless the
24 factory can show that the claim was false or
Req. No. 1879 Page 37

1 fraudulent or that the new motor vehicle dealer or new
2 powersports vehicle dealer failed to reasonably
3 substantiate the claim by the written reasonable
4 procedures of the factory. A factory shall not deny a
5 claim or implement a charge-back against a new vehicle
6 dealer after payment of a claim in the event a
7 purchaser of a new vehicle that is the subject of a
8 claim fails to comply with titling or registration
9 laws of this state and is not prevented from
10 compliance by any action of the dealer; provided, that
11 the factory may require the dealer to provide, within
12 thirty (30) days of notice of charge-back, withholding
13 of payment, or denial of claim, the documentation to
14 demonstrate the vehicle sale, delivery, and customer
15 qualification for an incentive as reported, including
16 consumer name and address and written attestation
17 signed by the dealer operator or general manager
18 stating the consumer was not on the export control
19 list and the dealer did not know or have reason to
20 know the vehicle was being exported or resold.
21 The factory shall provide written notice to a dealer
22 of a proposed charge-back that is the result of an
23 audit along with the specific audit results and
24 proposed charge-back amount. A dealer that receives
Req. No. 1879 Page 38

1 notice of a proposed charge-back pursuant to a
2 factory’s audit has the right to file a protest with
3 the Commission within thirty (30) days after receipt
4 of the notice of the charge-back or audit results,
5 whichever is later. The factory is prohibited from
6 implementing the charge-back or debiting the dealer’s
7 account until either the time frame for filing a
8 protest has passed or a final adjudication is rendered
9 by the Commission, whichever is later, unless the
10 dealer has agreed to the charge-back or charge-backs,
11 c. fails to compensate the new motor vehicle dealer for a
12 used motor vehicle:
13 (1) that is of the same make and model manufactured,
14 imported, or distributed by the factory and is a
15 line-make that the new motor vehicle dealer is
16 franchised to sell or on which the new motor
17 vehicle dealer is authorized to perform recall
18 repairs,
19 (2) that is subject to a stop-sale or do-not-drive
20 order issued by the factory or an authorized
21 governmental agency,
22 (3) that is held by the new motor vehicle dealer in
23 the dealer’s inventory at the time the stop-sale
24 or do-not-drive order is issued or that is taken
Req. No. 1879 Page 39

1 by the new motor vehicle dealer into the dealer’s
2 inventory after the recall notice as a result of
3 a retail consumer trade-in or a lease return to
4 the dealer inventory in accordance with an
5 applicable lease contract,
6 (4) that cannot be repaired due to the
7 unavailability, within thirty (30) days after
8 issuance of the stop-sale or do-not-drive order,
9 of a remedy or parts necessary for the new motor
10 vehicle dealer to make the recall repair, and
11 (5) that is not at least in the prorated amount of
12 one percent (1.00%) of the value of the vehicle
13 per month beginning on the date that is thirty
14 (30) days after the date on which the stop-sale
15 order was provided to the new motor vehicle
16 dealer until the earlier of either of the
17 following:
18 (a) the date the recall remedy or parts are made
19 available, or
20 (b) the date the new motor vehicle dealer sells,
21 trades, or otherwise disposes of the
22 affected used motor vehicle.
23 For the purposes of division (5) of this subparagraph,
24 the value of a used vehicle shall be the average Black
Req. No. 1879 Page 40

1 Book value for the year, make, and model of the
2 recalled vehicle. A factory may direct the manner and
3 method in which a new motor vehicle dealer must
4 demonstrate the inventory status of an affected used
5 motor vehicle to determine eligibility under this
6 subparagraph; provided, that the manner and method may
7 not be unduly burdensome and may not require
8 information that is unduly burdensome to provide. All
9 reimbursement claims made by new motor vehicle dealers
10 pursuant to this section for recall remedies or
11 repairs, or for compensation where no part or repair
12 is reasonably available and the vehicle is subject to
13 a stop-sale or do-not-drive order, shall be subject to
14 the same limitations and requirements as a warranty
15 reimbursement claim made under subparagraph b of this
16 paragraph. In the alternative, a manufacturer may
17 compensate its franchised new motor vehicle dealers
18 under a national recall compensation program;
19 provided, the compensation under the program is equal
20 to or greater than that provided under division (5) of
21 this subparagraph, or as the manufacturer and new
22 motor vehicle dealer otherwise agree. Nothing in this
23 section shall require a factory to provide total
24 compensation to a new motor vehicle dealer which would
Req. No. 1879 Page 41

1 exceed the total average Black Book value of the
2 affected used motor vehicle as originally determined
3 under division (5) of this subparagraph. Any remedy
4 provided to a new motor vehicle dealer under this
5 subparagraph is exclusive and may not be combined with
6 any other state or federal compensation remedy,
7 d. unreasonably fails or refuses to offer to its same
8 line-make franchised dealers a reasonable supply and
9 mix of all models manufactured for that line-make, or
10 unreasonably requires a dealer to pay any extra fee,
11 purchase unreasonable advertising displays or other
12 materials, or enter into a separate agreement which
13 adversely alters the rights or obligations contained
14 within the dealer’s existing franchise agreement or
15 which waives any right of the new motor vehicle dealer
16 or new powersports vehicle dealer as protected by
17 Section 561 et seq. of this title, or remodel,
18 renovate, or recondition the dealer’s existing
19 facilities as a prerequisite to receiving a model or
20 series of vehicles, except as may be necessary to sell
21 or service the model or series of vehicles as provided
22 by subparagraph e of this paragraph. It shall be a
23 violation of this section for new vehicle allocation
24 to be withheld subject to any requirement to purchase
Req. No. 1879 Page 42

1 or sell any number of used or off-lease vehicles. The
2 failure to deliver any such new motor vehicle shall
3 not be considered a violation of the section if the
4 failure is not arbitrary or is due to lack of
5 manufacturing capacity or to a strike or labor
6 difficulty, a shortage of materials, a freight
7 embargo, or other cause over which the manufacturer
8 has no control. However, this subparagraph shall not
9 apply to limited production model vehicles, a vehicle
10 not advertised by the factory for sale in this state,
11 vehicles that are subject to allocation affected by
12 federal environmental laws or environmental laws of
13 this state, or vehicles allocated in response to an
14 unforeseen event or circumstance,
15 e. except as necessary to comply with a health or safety
16 law, or to comply with a technology requirement which
17 is necessary to sell or service a vehicle that the
18 franchised new motor vehicle dealer or new powersports
19 vehicle dealer is authorized or licensed by the
20 franchisor to sell or service, requires a dealer to
21 construct a new facility or substantially renovate the
22 dealer’s existing facility unless the facility
23 construction or renovation is justified by the
24 economic conditions existing at the time, as well as
Req. No. 1879 Page 43

1 the reasonably foreseeable projections, in the new
2 motor vehicle dealer’s market and in the automotive
3 industry. However, this subparagraph shall not apply
4 if the new motor vehicle dealer or new powersports
5 vehicle dealer voluntarily agrees to facility
6 construction or renovation in exchange for money,
7 credit, allowance, reimbursement, or additional
8 vehicle allocation to a dealer from the factory to
9 compensate the dealer for the cost of, or a portion of

11 Except as necessary to comply with a health or safety
12 law, or to comply with a technology or safety
13 requirement which is necessary to sell or service a
14 motor vehicle or powersports vehicle that the
15 franchised dealer is authorized or licensed by the
16 franchisor to sell or service, a new vehicle dealer
17 which completes a facility construction or renovation
18 pursuant to factory requirements shall not be required
19 to construct a new facility or renovate the existing
20 facility if the same area of the facility or premises
21 has been constructed or substantially altered within
22 the last ten (10) years and the construction or
23 alteration was approved by the manufacturer as a part
24 of a facility upgrade program, standard, or policy.
Req. No. 1879 Page 44

1 For purposes of this subparagraph, “substantially
2 altered” means to perform an alteration that
3 substantially impacts the architectural features,
4 characteristics, or integrity of a structure or lot.
5 The term shall not include routine maintenance
6 reasonably necessary to maintain a dealership in
7 attractive condition. If a facility upgrade program,
8 standard, or policy under which the dealer completed a
9 facility construction or substantial alteration does
10 not contain a specific time period during which the
11 manufacturer or distributor shall provide payments or
12 benefits to a participating dealer, or the time frame
13 specified under the program is reduced or canceled
14 prematurely in the unilateral discretion of the
15 manufacturer or distributor, the manufacturer or
16 distributor shall not deny the participating dealer
17 any payment or benefit under the terms of the program,
18 standard, or policy as it existed when the dealer
19 began to perform under the program, standard, or
20 policy for the balance of the ten-year period,
21 regardless of whether the manufacturer’s or
22 distributor’s program, standard, or policy has been
23 changed or canceled, unless the manufacturer and

3 f. requires a new motor vehicle dealer or new powersports
4 vehicle dealer to establish an exclusive facility,
5 unless supported by reasonable business, market, and
6 economic considerations; provided, that this section
7 shall not restrict the terms of any agreement for such
8 exclusive facility voluntarily entered into and
9 supported by valuable consideration separate from the
10 new motor vehicle dealer’s right to sell and service
11 motor vehicles for the franchisor,
12 g. requires a new motor vehicle dealer or new powersports
13 vehicle dealer to enter into a site-control agreement
14 covering any or all of the new motor vehicle dealer’s
15 facilities or premises; provided, that this section
16 shall not restrict the terms of any site-control
17 agreement voluntarily entered into and supported by
18 valuable consideration separate from the new motor
19 vehicle dealer’s right to sell and service motor
20 vehicles for the franchisor. Notwithstanding the
21 foregoing or the terms of any site-control agreement,
22 a site-control agreement automatically extinguishes if
23 all of the factory’s franchises that operated from the
24 location that are the subject of the site-control

3 h. refuses to pay, or claims reimbursement from, a new
4 motor vehicle dealer or new powersports vehicle dealer
5 for sales, incentives, or other payments related to a
6 vehicle sold by the dealer because the purchaser of
7 the new vehicle exported or resold the vehicle in
8 violation of the policy of the factory unless the
9 factory can show that, at the time of the sale, the
10 new vehicle dealer knew or reasonably should have
11 known of the purchaser’s intention to export or resell
12 the vehicle. There is a rebuttable presumption that
13 the new vehicle dealer did not know or could not have
14 known that the vehicle would be exported if the
15 vehicle is titled and registered in any state of the
16 United States, or
17 i. (1) notwithstanding the terms of a franchise
18 agreement or other agreement except as provided
19 in this subsection, requires a new motor vehicle
20 dealer or new powersports vehicle dealer to
21 purchase or utilize goods or services, or
22 contract with any vendor, identified, selected,
23 or designated by the factory for the:

Req. No. 1879 Page 47

1 (a) operation of the dealership, including
2 electronic services such as websites, data
3 management or storage systems, digital
4 retail platforms, software, or other digital
5 services or platforms, or
6 (b) construction, renovation, or improvement of
7 the new dealer’s facility from a vendor
8 chosen by the factory if.
9 If goods or services available from other sources
10 a vendor that the new motor vehicle dealer
11 chooses are of substantially similar quality,
12 function, and design and comply with all
13 applicable laws; provided, however, that such
14 goods are not subject to the factory’s
15 intellectual property or trademark rights and the
16 new vehicle dealer has received the factory’s
17 approval, which approval may not be unreasonably
18 withheld. Nothing in this subparagraph may be
19 construed to allow a new motor vehicle dealer or
20 new powersports vehicle dealer to impair or
21 eliminate a factory’s intellectual property,
22 trademark rights, or trade dress usage
23 guidelines. Nothing in this section subparagraph
24 prohibits the enforcement of a voluntary
Req. No. 1879 Page 48

1 agreement between the factory and the new vehicle
2 dealer where separate and valuable consideration
3 has been offered and accepted.
4 It is a violation of this subparagraph for a
5 factory, or any entity that operates on behalf of
6 a factory, to coerce a new motor vehicle dealer
7 to purchase or utilize certain goods or services
8 by withholding vehicle allocation that the new
9 motor vehicle dealer is otherwise eligible to
10 receive, and
11 (2) for the purposes of this subparagraph, “goods and
12 services” do not include:
13 (a) moveable displays, brochures, promotional
14 materials, or electronic or digital media
15 containing material subject to the
16 intellectual property rights of a factory or
17 parts to be used in repairs under warranty
18 obligations of a factory, or
19 (b) special tools or training required by the
20 factory to perform warranty or recall
21 related repairs;
22 10. Being a factory that:
23 a. establishes a system of motor vehicle allocation or
24 distribution which is unfair, inequitable, or
Req. No. 1879 Page 49

1 unreasonably discriminatory. Upon the request of any
2 new motor vehicle dealer or new powersports vehicle
3 dealer franchised by it, a factory shall disclose in
4 writing to the dealer the basis upon which new
5 vehicles are allocated, scheduled, and delivered among
6 the new motor vehicle dealers of the same line-make
7 for that factory, or
8 b. changes an established plan or system of new motor
9 vehicle or new powersports vehicle distribution. A
10 new motor vehicle dealer or new powersports vehicle
11 dealer franchise agreement shall continue in full
12 force and operation notwithstanding a change, in whole
13 or in part, of an established plan or system of
14 distribution of the motor vehicles or new powersports
15 vehicles offered or previously offered for sale under
16 the franchise agreement. The appointment of a new
17 importer or distributor for motor vehicles or new
18 powersports vehicle offered for sale under the
19 franchise agreement shall be deemed to be a change of
20 an established plan or system of distribution. The
21 discontinuation of a line-make shall not be deemed to
22 be a change of an established plan or system of motor
23 vehicle or new powersports vehicle distribution. The
24 creation of a line-make shall not be deemed to be a
Req. No. 1879 Page 50

1 change of an established plan or system of motor
2 vehicle distribution as long as the new line-make is
3 not selling the same, or substantially the same
4 vehicle or vehicles previously sold through another
5 line-make by new motor vehicle dealers or new
6 powersports vehicle dealers with an active franchise
7 agreement for the other line-make in the state if such
8 dealers are no longer authorized to sell the
9 comparable vehicle previously sold through their line-
10 make. Changing a vehicle’s powertrain is not
11 sufficient to show it is substantially different.
12 Upon the occurrence of such change, the manufacturer
13 or distributor shall be prohibited from obtaining a
14 license to distribute vehicles under the new plan or
15 system of distribution unless the manufacturer or
16 distributor offers to each vehicle dealer who is a
17 party to the franchise agreement a new franchise
18 agreement containing substantially the same provisions
19 which were contained in the previous franchise
20 agreement;
21 11. Being a factory that sells directly or indirectly new motor
22 vehicles or new powersports vehicles to any retail consumer in the
23 state except through a new motor vehicle dealer or new powersports
24 vehicle dealer holding a franchise for the line-make that includes

2 does not apply to factory sales of new vehicles to its employees,
3 family members of employees, retirees and family members of
4 retirees, not-for-profit organizations, or the federal, state, or
5 local governments. The provisions of this paragraph shall not
6 preclude a factory from providing information to a consumer for the
7 purpose of marketing or facilitating a sale of a new vehicle or from
8 establishing a program to sell or offer to sell new motor vehicles
9 or new powersports vehicle through participating dealers subject to
10 the limitations provided in paragraph 2 of Section 562 of this
11 title;
12 12. a. Being a factory which directly or indirectly:

19 or new powersports vehicle dealer, or
20 (3) acts in the capacity of a new motor vehicle
21 dealer or new powersports vehicle dealer.
22 b. (1) This paragraph does not prohibit a factory from
23 owning or controlling a new motor vehicle dealer
24 or new powersports vehicle dealer while in a bona
Req. No. 1879 Page 52

1 fide relationship with a dealer development
2 candidate who has made a substantial initial
3 investment in the franchise and whose initial
4 investment is subject to potential loss. The
5 dealer development candidate can reasonably
6 expect to acquire full ownership of a new vehicle
7 dealer within a reasonable period of time not to
8 exceed ten (10) years and on reasonable terms and
9 conditions. The ten-year acquisition period may
10 be expanded for good cause shown.
11 (2) This paragraph does not prohibit a factory from
12 owning, operating, controlling, or acting in the
13 capacity of a new motor vehicle dealer or new
14 powersports vehicle dealer for a period not to
15 exceed twelve (12) months during the transition
16 from one independent dealer to another
17 independent dealer if the dealership is for sale
18 at a reasonable price and on reasonable terms and
19 conditions to an independent qualified buyer. On
20 showing by a factory of good cause, the Oklahoma
21 New Motor Vehicle Commission may extend the time
22 limit set forth above; extensions may be granted
23 for periods not to exceed twelve (12) months.
24

7 owning, directly or indirectly, a minority
8 interest in an entity that owns, operates, or
9 controls motor vehicle dealerships or powersports
10 vehicle dealerships of the same line-make
11 franchised by the manufacturer, provided that
12 each of the following conditions are met:

14 powersports vehicle dealerships selling the
15 vehicles of that manufacturer in this state
16 trade exclusively in the line-make of that
17 manufacturer,
18 (b) all of the franchise agreements of the
19 manufacturer confer rights on the dealer of
20 the line-make to develop and operate, within
21 a defined geographic territory or area, as
22 many dealership facilities as the dealer and
23 manufacturer shall agree are appropriate,

8 (70) miles,
9 (d) during any period in which the manufacturer
