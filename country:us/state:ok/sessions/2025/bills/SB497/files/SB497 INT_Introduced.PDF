AS INTRODUCED
6
7
An Act relating to criminal procedure; amending 22
7
O.S. 2021, Section 1161, which relates to acts
8
committed by persons with mental illness or mental
8
defect; requiring Forensic Review Board to provide
9
certain notice to district attorney; updating
9
statutory language; and providing an effective date.
10
10
11
11
12
BE IT ENACTED BY THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF OKLAHOMA:
12
13
SECTION 1. AMENDATORY 22 O.S. 2021, Section 1161, is
13
14
amended to read as follows:
14
15
Section 1161. A. 1. An act committed by a person in a state
15
16
of mental illness or mental defect shall be adjudicated as guilty
16
17
with mental defect or as not guilty by reason of mental illness.
17
18
2. If a person is found guilty with mental defect or enters a
18
19
plea of guilty with mental defect which is accepted by the court,
19
20
the court at the time of sentencing shall impose any sentence that
20
21
could be imposed by law upon a person who is convicted of the same
21
22
offense, and the person shall serve the sentence in custody of a
22
23
county jail or the Oklahoma Department of Corrections.
23
24
24
Req. No. 471 Page 1

1
3. If a person who is found guilty with mental defect is placed
1
2
on probation under the jurisdiction of the sentencing court as
2
3
provided by law, the court shall immediately issue an order for the
3
4
person to be examined by the Department of Mental Health and
4
5
Substance Abuse Services. The time and place of such examination
5
6
shall be determined by the Department. Within forty-five (45) days,
6
7
the Department shall provide to the court a recommendation of
7
8
treatment for the person, which shall be made a condition of
8
9
probation. Reports as specified by the trial judge shall be filed
9
10
with the probation officer and the sentencing court. Failure to
10
11
continue treatment, except by agreement with the treating agency and
11
12
the sentencing court, is grounds for revocation of probation.
12
13
Treatment shall be provided by an agency of the Department or, with
13
14
the approval of the sentencing court and at the expense of the
14
15
person, by private agencies, private physicians or other mental
15
16
health personnel. A psychiatric report shall be filed with the
16
17
probation officer and the sentencing court every six (6) months
17
18
during the period of probation.
18
19
4. When in any criminal action by indictment or information,
19
20
the defense of mental illness is raised, but the defendant is not
20
21
acquitted on the ground that the defendant was mentally ill at the
21
22
time of the commission of the crime charged, an issue concerning
22
23
such defense may be raised on appeal. If the appellate court finds
23
24
relief is required, the appellate court shall not have authority to
24
Req. No. 471 Page 2

1
modify the judgment or sentence, but will only have the authority to
1
2
order a new trial or order resentencing without recommendations to
2
3
sentencing.
3
4
5. When in any criminal action by indictment or information the
4
5
defense of mental illness is interposed either singly or in
5
6
conjunction with some other defense, the jury shall state in the
6
7
verdict, if it is one of acquittal, whether or not the defendant is
7
8
acquitted on the ground of mental illness. When the defendant is
8
9
acquitted on the ground that the defendant was mentally ill at the
9
10
time of the commission of the crime charged, the person shall not be
10
11
discharged from custody until the court has made a determination
11
12
that the person is not dangerous to the public peace and safety and
12
13
is a person requiring treatment.
13
14
B. 1. To assist the court in its determination, the court
14
15
shall immediately issue an order for the person to be examined by
15
16
the Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services at a
16
17
facility the Department has designated to examine and treat forensic
17
18
individuals. Upon the issuance of the order, the sheriff shall
18
19
deliver the person to the designated facility.
19
20
2. Within forty-five (45) days of the court entering such an
20
21
order, a hearing shall be conducted by the court to ascertain
21
22
whether the person is dangerous to the public peace or safety
22
23
because the person is a person requiring treatment or, if not, is in
23
24
need of continued supervision as a result of unresolved symptoms of
24
Req. No. 471 Page 3

1
mental illness or a history of treatment noncompliance. During the
1
2
required period of hospitalization, the Department of Mental Health
2
3
and Substance Abuse Services shall have the person examined by two
3
4
qualified psychiatrists or one such psychiatrist and one qualified
4
5
clinical psychologist whose training and experience enable the
5
6
professional to form expert opinions regarding mental illness,
6
7
competency, dangerousness and criminal responsibility.

8
C. 1. Each examiner shall, within thirty-five (35) days of
8
9
hospitalization, individually prepare and submit to the court, the
9
10
district attorney and the trial counsel of the person a report of
10
11
the psychiatric examination findings of the person and an evaluation
11
12
concerning whether the person is dangerous to the public peace or
12
13
safety.
13
14
2. If the court is dissatisfied with the reports or if a
14
15
disagreement on the issue of mental illness and dangerousness exists
15
16
between the two examiners, the court may designate one or more
16
17
additional examiners and have them submit their findings and
17
18
evaluations as specified in paragraph 1 of this subsection.
18
19
3. a. Within ten (10) days after the reports are filed, the
19
20
court must conduct a hearing to determine the present
20
21
condition of the person as to the issue of whether:
21
22
(1) the person is dangerous to the public peace or
22
23
safety because the person is a person requiring
23
24
treatment, or
24
Req. No. 471 Page 4

1
(2) if not believed to be dangerous to the public
1
2
peace or safety, the person is in need of
2
3
continued supervision as a result of unresolved
3
4
symptoms of mental illness or a history of
4
5
treatment noncompliance.
5
6
b. The district attorney must establish the foregoing by
6
7
a preponderance of the evidence. At this hearing the
7
8
person shall have the assistance of counsel and may
8
9
present independent evidence.
9
10
D. 1. If the court finds that the person is not dangerous to
10
11
the public peace or safety because the person is a person requiring
11
12
treatment and is not in need of continued supervision as a result of
12
13
unresolved symptoms of mental illness or a history of treatment
13
14
noncompliance, it shall immediately discharge the person from
14
15
hospitalization.
15
16
2. If the court finds that the person is dangerous to the
16
17
public peace and safety, it shall commit the person to the custody
17
18
of the Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services.
18
19
The person shall then be subject to discharge pursuant to the

20
procedure set forth in this section.

conditional release pursuant to the procedures set
4
5
forth in this section.
5
6
E. If at any time the court finds the person is not dangerous
6
7
to the public peace or safety because the person is a person
7
8
requiring treatment, but is in need of continued supervision as a
8
9
result of unresolved symptoms of mental illness or a history of
9
10
