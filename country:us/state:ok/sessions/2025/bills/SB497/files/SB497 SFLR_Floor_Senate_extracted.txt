15 of mental illness or mental defect shall be adjudicated as guilty
16 with mental defect or as not guilty by reason of mental illness.
17 2. If a person is found guilty with mental defect or enters a

21 offense, and the person shall serve the sentence in custody of a

4 shall be determined by the Department. Within forty-five (45) days,
5 the Department shall provide to the court a recommendation of
6 treatment for the person, which shall be made a condition of
7 probation. Reports as specified by the trial judge shall be filed
8 with the probation officer and the sentencing court. Failure to
9 continue treatment, except by agreement with the treating agency and
10 the sentencing court, is grounds for revocation of probation.
11 Treatment shall be provided by an agency of the Department or, with
12 the approval of the sentencing court and at the expense of the
13 person, by private agencies, private physicians or other mental

16 during the period of probation.
17 4. When in any criminal action by indictment or information,
18 the defense of mental illness is raised, but the defendant is not

20 time of the commission of the crime charged, an issue concerning
21 such defense may be raised on appeal. If the appellate court finds
22 relief is required, the appellate court shall not have authority to
23 modify the judgment or sentence, but will only have the authority to

7 acquitted on the ground of mental illness. When the defendant is
8 acquitted on the ground that the defendant was mentally ill at the
9 time of the commission of the crime charged, the person shall not be
10 discharged from custody until the court has made a determination

19 2. Within forty-five (45) days of the court entering such an
20 order, a hearing shall be conducted by the court to ascertain
21 whether the person is dangerous to the public peace or safety
22 because the person is a person requiring treatment or, if not, is in
23 need of continued supervision as a result of unresolved symptoms of
24 mental illness or a history of treatment noncompliance. During the

8 hospitalization, individually prepare and submit to the court, the
9 district attorney and the trial counsel of the person a report of
10 the psychiatric examination findings of the person and an evaluation
11 concerning whether the person is dangerous to the public peace or
12 safety.
13 2. If the court is dissatisfied with the reports or if a
14 disagreement on the issue of mental illness and dangerousness exists
15 between the two examiners, the court may designate one or more
16 additional examiners and have them submit their findings and
17 evaluations as specified in paragraph 1 of this subsection.
18 3. a. Within ten (10) days after the reports are filed, the

15 hospitalization.
16 2. If the court finds that the person is dangerous to the

4 defense of mental illness is interposed either singly or in
5 conjunction with some other defense, the jury shall state in the
6 verdict, if it is one of acquittal, whether or not the defendant is
7 acquitted on the ground of mental illness. When the defendant is
8 acquitted on the ground that the defendant was mentally ill at the
9 time of the commission of the crime charged, the person shall not be
10 discharged from custody until the court has made a determination
11 that the person is not dangerous to the public peace and safety and

14 disagreement on the issue of mental illness and dangerousness exists
15 between the two examiners, the court may designate one or more
16 additional examiners and have them submit their findings and
17 evaluations as specified in paragraph 1 of this subsection.
