3 B. Provided that, the defendant in such action may, not less
4 than ten (10) days after being served with summons, serve upon the
5 plaintiff or his attorney a written offer to allow judgment to be
6 taken against him. If the plaintiff accepts the offer and gives
7 notice thereof to the defendant or his attorney, within five (5)
8 days after the offer was served, the offer, and an affidavit that
9 the notice of acceptance was delivered within the time limited, may
10 be filed by the plaintiff, or the defendant, verified by affidavit.

22 judgment rendered is for the plaintiff, and is for a larger amount
23 than the defendant’s offer, then the plaintiff shall be entitled to
