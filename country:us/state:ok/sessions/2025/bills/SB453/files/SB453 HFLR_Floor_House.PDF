1 B. Provided that, the defendant in such action may, not less
2 than ten (10) days after being served with summons, serve upon the
3 plaintiff or his attorney a written offer to allow judgment to be
4 taken against him. If the plaintiff accepts the offer and gives
5 notice thereof to the defendant or his attorney, within five (5)

16 recover attorney’s fees, court costs and interest. If the judgment
17 rendered is for the plaintiff, and is for the same amount as the
18 defendant’s offer, then the plaintiff and defendant shall incur
19 their own attorney’s fees, court costs and interest. And if the
20 judgment rendered is for the plaintiff, and is for a larger amount
