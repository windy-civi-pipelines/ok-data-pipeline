10
11
allocation in paragraph 4 of this subsection, being that which is
11
12
derived from a unitary business enterprise, shall be apportioned to

commenced on or after January 1, 2000, the three factors shall be
7
8
apportioned with property and payroll, each comprising twenty-five
8
9
percent (25%) of the apportionment factor and sales comprising fifty
9
10
percent (50%) of the apportionment factor. The apportionment
10
11
factors shall be computed as follows:
11
12
a. The property factor is a fraction, the numerator of
12
13
which is the average value of the taxpayer’s real and
13
14
tangible personal property owned or rented and used in
14
15
this state during the tax period and the denominator
15
16
of which is the average value of all the taxpayer’s
16
17
real and tangible personal property everywhere owned
17
18
or rented and used during the tax period.
18
19
(1) Property, the income from which is separately
19
20
allocated in paragraph 4 of this subsection,
20
21
shall not be included in determining this
21
22
fraction. The numerator of the fraction shall
22
23
include a portion of the investment in
23
24
transportation and other equipment having no
24
Req. No. 1079 Page 11

2
and trailers, including machinery and equipment
2
3
carried thereon, airplanes, salespersons’
3
4
automobiles and other similar equipment, in the
4
5
proportion that miles traveled in Oklahoma this
5
6
state by such equipment bears to total miles
6
7
traveled,
7
8
(2) Property owned by the taxpayer is valued at its
8
9
original cost. Property rented by the taxpayer
9
10
is valued at eight times the net annual rental
10
11
rate. Net annual rental rate is the annual
11
12
rental rate paid by the taxpayer, less any annual
12
13
rental rate received by the taxpayer from
13
14
subrentals,
14
15
(3) The average value of property shall be determined
15
16
by averaging the values at the beginning and
16
17
ending of the tax period but the Oklahoma Tax
17
18
Commission may require the averaging of monthly
18
19
values during the tax period if reasonably
19
20
required to reflect properly the average value of
20
21
the taxpayer’s property;
21
22
b. The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of
22
23
which is the total compensation for services rendered
23
24
in the state during the tax period, and the
24
Req. No. 1079 Page 12

1
denominator of which is the total compensation for
1
2
services rendered everywhere during the tax period.
2
3
“Compensation”, as used in this subsection, means
3
4
those paid-for services to the extent related to the
4
5
unitary business but does not include officers’
5
6
salaries, wages and other compensation.
6
7
(1) In the case of a transportation enterprise, the
7
8
numerator of the fraction shall include a portion
8
9
of such expenditure in connection with employees
9
10
operating equipment over a fixed route, such as
10
11
railroad employees, airline pilots, or bus
11
12
drivers, in this state only a part of the time,
12
13
in the proportion that mileage traveled in
13
14
Oklahoma this state bears to total mileage
14
15
traveled by such employees,
15
16
(2) In any case the numerator of the fraction shall
16
17
include a portion of such expenditures in
17
18
connection with itinerant employees, such as
18
19
traveling salespersons, in this state only a part
19
20
of the time, in the proportion that time spent in
20
21
Oklahoma this state bears to total time spent in
21
22
furtherance of the enterprise by such employees;
22
23
c. The sales factor is a fraction, the numerator of which
23
24
is the total sales or gross revenue of the taxpayer in
24
Req. No. 1079 Page 13

1
this state during the tax period, and the denominator
1
2
of which is the total sales or gross revenue of the
2
3
taxpayer everywhere during the tax period. “Sales”,
3
4
as used in this subsection, does not include sales or
4
5
gross revenue which are separately allocated in
5
6
paragraph 4 of this subsection.
6
7
(1) Sales of tangible personal property have a situs
7
8
in this state if the property is delivered or
8
9
shipped to a purchaser other than the United
9
10
States government, within this state regardless
10
11
of the FOB Freight on Board (FOB) point or other
11
12
conditions of the sale; or the property is

13
shipped from an office, store, warehouse, factory

the purchaser is the United States government or
15
16
(b) the taxpayer is not doing business in the
16
17
state of the destination of the shipment.
17
18
(2) In the case of a railroad or interurban railway
18
19
enterprise, the numerator of the fraction shall
19
20
not be less than the allocation of revenues to

21
this state as shown in its annual report to the
21
22
Corporation Commission.

3
of revenue from interstate transportation in the
3
4
proportion that interstate mileage traveled in
4
5
Oklahoma this state bears to total interstate
5
6
mileage traveled.
6
7
(4) In the case of an oil, gasoline or gas pipeline
7
8
enterprise, the numerator of the fraction shall
8
9
be either the total of traffic units of the
9
10
enterprise within Oklahoma this state or the
10
11
revenue allocated to Oklahoma this state based
11
12
upon miles moved, at the option of the taxpayer,
12
13
and the denominator of which shall be the total
13
14
of traffic units of the enterprise or the revenue
14
15
of the enterprise everywhere as appropriate to
15
16
the numerator. A “traffic unit” is hereby
16
17
defined as the transportation for a distance of
17
18
one (1) mile of one (1) barrel of oil, one (1)
18
19
gallon of gasoline or one thousand (1,000) cubic
19
20
feet of natural or casinghead gas, as the case

a uniform system of accounts prescribed by such
7
8
Commission, the intrastate net income shall be
8
9
determined separately in the manner provided by
9
10
such uniform system of accounts and only the
10
11
interstate income shall be subject to allocation
11
12
pursuant to the provisions of this subsection.
12
13
Provided further, that the gross revenue factors
13
14

18
19
portion of net income of the enterprise out of all appropriate
19
20
proportion to the property owned and/or business transacted within
20
21
this state, because of the fact that one or more of the factors so
21
22

enterprise; or because of other reasons, the Tax Commission is

empowered to permit, after a showing by taxpayer that an excessive
2
3
portion of net income has been attributed to Oklahoma this state, or
3
4
require, when in its judgment an insufficient portion of net income
4
5
has been attributed to Oklahoma this state, the elimination,
5
6
substitution, or use of additional factors, or reduction or increase
6

in the weight of such prescribed factors. Provided, however, that
7
8
any such variance from such prescribed factors which has the effect
8
9
of increasing the portion of net income attributable to Oklahoma
9
10
this state must not be inherently arbitrary, and application of the

11
recomputed final apportionment to the net income of the enterprise
11
12
must attribute to Oklahoma this state only a reasonable portion
12
13
thereof.

4
5
the event the total reduction in tax liability authorized by this
5
6
paragraph exceeds One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) in any
6
7
calendar year, the Tax Commission shall permit any excess over One
