SENATE FLOOR VERSION - HB2138 SFLR Page 1
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)
1 b. within twenty (20) days after the service of the
2 summons and petition upon the defendant, or within the
3 last day for answering if applicable; provided, a
4 defendant may file a reservation of time which shall
5 extend the time to respond twenty (20) days from the
6 last date for answering. The filing of such a
7 reservation of time waives defenses of paragraphs 2,
8 3, 4, 5, 6, and 9 of subsection B of this section.
9 2. A party served with a pleading stating a cross-claim against
10 that party shall serve an answer thereto within twenty (20) days
11 after the service upon the party.
12 3. The plaintiff shall serve a reply to a counterclaim in the
13 answer within twenty (20) days after service of the answer or, if a
14 reply is ordered by the court, within twenty (20) days after service
15 of the order, unless the order otherwise directs.
16 4. The party requesting a summons to be issued or filing a
17 counter-claim counterclaim or cross-claim may elect to have the
18 answer served within thirty-five (35) days in lieu of the twenty
19 (20) days set forth in this section.
20 5. The service of a motion permitted under this section or a
21 motion for summary judgment alters these periods of time as follows:
22 if the court denies the motion or postpones its disposition until
23 the trial on the merits, the responsive pleading shall be served
24
SENATE FLOOR VERSION - HB2138 SFLR Page 2
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)
1 with in twenty (20) days after notice of the court's action, unless a
2 different time is fixed by order of the court.
3 B. HOW PRESENTED. Every defense, in law or fact, to a claim
4 for relief in any pleading, whether a claim, counterclaim, cross-
5 claim, or third-party claim, shall be asserted in the responsive
6 pleading thereto if one is required, except that the following
7 defenses may at the option of the pleader be made by motion:
8 1. Lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter;
9 2. Lack of jurisdiction over the person;
10 3. Improper venue;
11 4. Insufficiency of process;
12 5. Insufficiency of service of process;
13 6. Failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted;
14 7. Failure to join a party under Section 2019 of this title;
15 8. Another action pending between the same parties for the same
16 claim;
17 9. Lack of capacity of a party to be sued; and
18 10. Lack of capacity of a party to sue.
19 A motion making any of these defenses shall be made before pleading
20 if a further pleading is permitted. No defense or objection is
21 waived by being joined with one or more other defenses or objections
22 in a responsive pleading or motion. If a pleading sets forth a
23 claim for relief to which the adverse party is not required to serve
24 a responsive pleading, the adverse party may assert at the trial any
SENATE FLOOR VERSION - HB2138 SFLR Page 3
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)
1 defe nse in law or fact to that claim for relief. If, on a motion
2 asserting the defense numbered 6 of this subsection to dismiss for
3 failure of the pleading to state a claim upon which relief can be
4 granted, matters outside the pleading are presented to and not
5 excluded by the court, the motion shall be treated as one for
6 summary judgment and all parties shall be given reasonable
7 opportunity to present all material made pertinent to the motion by
8 the rules for summary judgment. A motion to dismiss for failure to
9 state a claim upon which relief can be granted shall separately
10 state each omission or defect in the petition, and a motion that
11 does not specify such defects or omissions shall be denied without a
12 hearing and the defendant shall answer within twenty (20) days after
13 notice of the court's action.
14 C. PRELIMINARY HEARINGS. The defenses specifically enumerated
15 in paragraphs 1 through 10 of subsection B of this section, whether
16 made in a pleading or by motion, and the motion to strike mentioned
17 in subsection D of this section shall be heard and determined before
18 trial on application of any party, unless the court orders that the
19 hearing and determination thereof be deferred until the trial. If
20 the court determines that venue is proper, the action shall not be
21 dismissed for improper venue as a result of the jury's verdict or
22 the subsequent ruling of the court on a demurrer to the evidence or
23 a motion for a directed verdict.
24
SENATE FLOOR VERSION - HB2138 SFLR Page 4
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)
1 D. MOTION TO STRIKE. Upon motion made by a party before
2 responding to a pleading or, if no responsive pleading is permitted
3 by this act, upon motion made by a party within twenty (20) days
4 after the service of the pleading upon the party or upon the court's
5 own initiative at any time, the court may order stricken from any
6 pleading any insufficient defense. If, on a motion to strike an
7 insufficient defense, matters outside the pleadings are presented to
8 and not excluded by the court, the motion shall be treated as one
9 for partial summary judgment and all parties shall be given
10 reasonable opportunity to present all materials made pertinent to
11 the motion by the rules for summary judgment.
12 E. CONSOLIDATION OF DEFENSES IN MOTION. A party who makes a
13 motion under this section may join with it any other motions herein
14 provided for and then available to the party. If a party makes a
15 motion under this section but omits therefrom any defense or
16 objection then available to the party which this section permits to
17 be raised by motion, the party shall not thereafter make a motion
18 based on the defense or objection so omitted, except a motion as
19 provided in paragraph 2 of subsection F of this section on the
20 grounds there stated. The court in its discretion may permit a
21 party to amend a motion by stating additional defenses or objections
22 if an amendment is sought at least five (5) days before the hearing
23 on the motion.
24 F. WAIVER OR PRESERVATION OF CERTAIN DEFENSES.
SENATE FLOOR VERSION - HB2138 SFLR Page 5
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)
1 1. A defense of lack of jurisdiction over the person, improper
2 venue, insufficiency of process, insufficiency of service of
3 process, failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted,
4 or lack of capacity of a party to be sued is waived:
5 a. if omitted from a motion that raises any of the
6 defenses or objections which this section permits to
7 be raised by motion, or
8 b. if it is not made by motion and it is not included in
9 a responsive pleading or an amendment thereof
10 permitted by subsection A of Section 2015 of this
11 title to be made as a matter of course. A motion to
12 strike an insufficient defense is waived if not raised
13 as in subsection D of this section.
14 2. A defense of failure to join a party indispensable under
15 Section 2019 of this title may be made in any pleading permitted or
16 ordered under subsection A of Section 2007 of this title or at the
17 trial on the merits. A defense of another action pending between
18 the same parties for the same claim or a defense of lack of capacity
19 of a party to sue may be made in any pleading permitted or ordered
20 pursuant to the provisions of subsection A of Section 2007 of this
21 title or at the pretrial conference.
22 3. Whenever it appears by suggestion of the parties or
23 otherwise that the court lacks jurisdiction of the subject matter,
24 the court shall dismiss the action.
SENATE FLOOR VERSION - HB2138 SFLR Page 6
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)
1 4. A waiver of the defense in paragraph 6 of subsection B of
2 this section does not preclude a later contention that a party is
3 not entitled to any relief as a matter of law, either by motion for
4 summary judgment, or by demurrer or motion at or after trial.
5 G. FINAL DISMISSAL ON FAILURE TO AMEND. On granting a motion
6 to dismiss a claim for relief, the court shall grant leave to amend
7 if the defect can be remedied and shall specify the time within
8 which an amended pleading shall be filed. If the amended pleading
9 is not filed within the time allowed, final judgment of dismissal
10 with prejudice shall be entered on motion except in cases of
11 excusable neglect. In such cases amendment shall be made by the
12 party in default within a time specified by the court for filing an
13 amended pleading. Within the time allowed by the court for filing
14 an amended pleading, a plaintiff may voluntarily dismiss the action
15 without prejudice.
16 H. MOTION FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT NOT REQUIRED IF DEFENDANT FAILS
17 TO FILE RESPONSE. Nothing in any provision of this title or in any
18 local or district court rule shall be construed to require either a
19 motion or a hearing for default judgment, and no notice shall be
20 necessary, if, after service of summons and petition, a defendant
21 fails to timely file with the court clerk within twenty (20) days a
22 written appearance, answer, motion, pleading, or response as
23 provided in subsection A of this section. Contact or communication
24 with the plaintiff or attorney of the plaintiff shall not constitute
SENATE FLOOR VERSION - HB2138 SFLR Page 7
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)
1 an a ppearance, answer, motion, pleading, or response unless the
2 contact or communication is in writing and is also timely filed by
3 the defendant in writing with the court clerk as provided in
4 subsection A of this section. The provisions of this subsection
5 shall not be construed to prevent an evidentiary hearing concerning
6 the amount of damage to be awarded.

5 own initiative at any time, the court may order stricken from any
6 pleading any insufficient defense. If, on a motion to strike an
7 insufficient defense, matters outside the pleadings are presented to
8 and not excluded by the court, the motion shall be treated as one
9 for partial summary judgment and all parties shall be given
10 reasonable opportunity to present all materials made pertinent to
11 the motion by the rules for summary judgment.
12 E. CONSOLIDATION OF DEFENSES IN MOTION. A party who makes a
13 motion under this section may join with it any other motions herein
14 provided for and then available to the party. If a party makes a
15 motion under this section but omits therefrom any defense or
16 objection then available to the party which this section permits to
17 be raised by motion, the party shall not thereafter make a motion
18 based on the defense or objection so omitted, except a motion as
19 provided in paragraph 2 of subsection F of this section on the
20 grounds there stated. The court in its discretion may permit a
21 party to amend a motion by stating additional defenses or objections
22 if an amendment is sought at least five (5) days before the hearing
23 on the motion.
24 F. WAIVER OR PRESERVATION OF CERTAIN DEFENSES.
SENATE FLOOR VERSION - HB2138 SFLR Page 5
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)

1 1. A defense of lack of jurisdiction over the person, improper
2 venue, insufficiency of process, insufficiency of service of
3 process, failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted,
4 or lack of capacity of a party to be sued is waived:
5 a. if omitted from a motion that raises any of the
6 defenses or objections which this section permits to
7 be raised by motion, or
8 b. if it is not made by motion and it is not included in
9 a responsive pleading or an amendment thereof
10 permitted by subsection A of Section 2015 of this
11 title to be made as a matter of course. A motion to
12 strike an insufficient defense is waived if not raised
13 as in subsection D of this section.
14 2. A defense of failure to join a party indispensable under
15 Section 2019 of this title may be made in any pleading permitted or
16 ordered under subsection A of Section 2007 of this title or at the
17 trial on the merits. A defense of another action pending between
18 the same parties for the same claim or a defense of lack of capacity
19 of a party to sue may be made in any pleading permitted or ordered
20 pursuant to the provisions of subsection A of Section 2007 of this
21 title or at the pretrial conference.
22 3. Whenever it appears by suggestion of the parties or
23 otherwise that the court lacks jurisdiction of the subject matter,
24 the court shall dismiss the action.
SENATE FLOOR VERSION - HB2138 SFLR Page 6
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)

1 4. A waiver of the defense in paragraph 6 of subsection B of
2 this section does not preclude a later contention that a party is
3 not entitled to any relief as a matter of law, either by motion for
4 summary judgment, or by demurrer or motion at or after trial.
5 G. FINAL DISMISSAL ON FAILURE TO AMEND. On granting a motion
6 to dismiss a claim for relief, the court shall grant leave to amend
7 if the defect can be remedied and shall specify the time within
8 which an amended pleading shall be filed. If the amended pleading
9 is not filed within the time allowed, final judgment of dismissal
10 with prejudice shall be entered on motion except in cases of
11 excusable neglect. In such cases amendment shall be made by the
12 party in default within a time specified by the court for filing an
13 amended pleading. Within the time allowed by the court for filing
14 an amended pleading, a plaintiff may voluntarily dismiss the action
15 without prejudice.
16 H. MOTION FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT NOT REQUIRED IF DEFENDANT FAILS
17 TO FILE RESPONSE. Nothing in any provision of this title or in any
18 local or district court rule shall be construed to require either a
19 motion or a hearing for default judgment, and no notice shall be
20 necessary, if, after service of summons and petition, a defendant
21 fails to timely file with the court clerk within twenty (20) days a
22 written appearance, answer, motion, pleading, or response as
23 provided in subsection A of this section. Contact or communication
24 with the plaintiff or attorney of the plaintiff shall not constitute

1 an a ppearance, answer, motion, pleading, or response unless the
2 contact or communication is in writing and is also timely filed by
3 the defendant in writing with the court clerk as provided in
4 subsection A of this section. The provisions of this subsection
5 shall not be construed to prevent an evidentiary hearing concerning
6 the amount of damage to be awarded.
