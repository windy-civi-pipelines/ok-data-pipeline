1 last day for answering if applicable; provided, a
2 defendant may file a reservation of time which shall
3 extend the time to respond twenty (20) days from the

13 of the order, unless the order otherwise directs.
14 4. The party requesting a summons to be issued or filing a

ENGR. H. B. NO. 2138 Page 2
1 B. HOW PRESENTED. Every defense, in law or fact, to a claim
2 for relief in any pleading, whether a claim, counterclaim, cross-
3 claim, or third-party claim, shall be asserted in the responsive
4 pleading thereto if one is required, except that the following
5 defenses may at the option of the pleader be made by motion:
6 1. Lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter;
7 2. Lack of jurisdiction over the person;
8 3. Improper venue;
9 4. Insufficiency of process;
10 5. Insufficiency of service of process;
11 6. Failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted;

17 A motion making any of these defenses shall be made before pleading
18 if a further pleading is permitted. No defense or objection is
19 waived by being joined with one or more other defenses or objections
20 in a responsive pleading or motion. If a pleading sets forth a
21 claim for relief to which the adverse party is not required to serve
22 a responsive pleading, the adverse party may assert at the trial any
23 defense in law or fact to that claim for relief. If, on a motion
24 asserting the defense numbered 6 of this subsection to dismiss for
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2138 Page 3
1 fail ure of the pleading to state a claim upon which relief can be
2 granted, matters outside the pleading are presented to and not
3 excluded by the court, the motion shall be treated as one for
4 summary judgment and all parties shall be given reasonable
5 opportunity to present all material made pertinent to the motion by
6 the rules for summary judgment. A motion to dismiss for failure to
7 state a claim upon which relief can be granted shall separately
8 state each omission or defect in the petition, and a motion that
9 does not specify such defects or omissions shall be denied without a
10 hearing and the defendant shall answer within twenty (20) days after

12 C. PRELIMINARY HEARINGS. The defenses specifically enumerated
13 in paragraphs 1 through 10 of subsection B of this section, whether
14 made in a pleading or by motion, and the motion to strike mentioned
15 in subsection D of this section shall be heard and determined before
16 trial on application of any party, unless the court orders that the
17 hearing and determination thereof be deferred until the trial. If
18 the court determines that venue is proper, the action shall not be
19 dismissed for improper venue as a result of the jury's verdict or
20 the subsequent ruling of the court on a demurrer to the evidence or
21 a motion for a directed verdict.
22 D. MOTION TO STRIKE. Upon motion made by a party before
23 responding to a pleading or, if no responsive pleading is permitted
24 by this act, upon motion made by a party within twenty (20) days
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2138 Page 4
1 afte r the service of the pleading upon the party or upon the court's
2 own initiative at any time, the court may order stricken from any
3 pleading any insufficient defense. If, on a motion to strike an
4 insufficient defense, matters outside the pleadings are presented to
5 and not excluded by the court, the motion shall be treated as one
6 for partial summary judgment and all parties shall be given
7 reasonable opportunity to present all materials made pertinent to
8 the motion by the rules for summary judgment.
9 E. CONSOLIDATION OF DEFENSES IN MOTION. A party who makes a
10 motion under this section may join with it any other motions herein
11 provided for and then available to the party. If a party makes a
12 motion under this section but omits therefrom any defense or
13 objection then available to the party which this section permits to
14 be raised by motion, the party shall not thereafter make a motion
15 based on the defense or objection so omitted, except a motion as
16 provided in paragraph 2 of subsection F of this section on the
17 grounds there stated. The court in its discretion may permit a
18 party to amend a motion by stating additional defenses or objections
19 if an amendment is sought at least five (5) days before the hearing
20 on the motion.
21 F. WAIVER OR PRESERVATION OF CERTAIN DEFENSES.
22 1. A defense of lack of jurisdiction over the person, improper
23 venue, insufficiency of process, insufficiency of service of
24
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2138 Page 5
1 proc ess, failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted,
2 or lack of capacity of a party to be sued is waived:
3 a. if omitted from a motion that raises any of the
4 defenses or objections which this section permits to
5 be raised by motion, or
6 b. if it is not made by motion and it is not included in
7 a responsive pleading or an amendment thereof
8 permitted by subsection A of Section 2015 of this
9 title to be made as a matter of course. A motion to
10 strike an insufficient defense is waived if not raised
11 as in subsection D of this section.
12 2. A defense of failure to join a party indispensable under
13 Section 2019 of this title may be made in any pleading permitted or
14 ordered under subsection A of Section 2007 of this title or at the
15 trial on the merits. A defense of another action pending between
16 the same parties for the same claim or a defense of lack of capacity
17 of a party to sue may be made in any pleading permitted or ordered
18 pursuant to the provisions of subsection A of Section 2007 of this
19 title or at the pretrial conference.
20 3. Whenever it appears by suggestion of the parties or
21 otherwise that the court lacks jurisdiction of the subject matter,
22 the court shall dismiss the action.
23 4. A waiver of the defense in paragraph 6 of subsection B of
24 this section does not preclude a later contention that a party is
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2138 Page 6
1 not entitled to any relief as a matter of law, either by motion for
2 summary judgment, or by demurrer or motion at or after trial.
3 G. FINAL DISMISSAL ON FAILURE TO AMEND. On granting a motion
4 to dismiss a claim for relief, the court shall grant leave to amend
5 if the defect can be remedied and shall specify the time within
6 which an amended pleading shall be filed. If the amended pleading
7 is not filed within the time allowed, final judgment of dismissal
8 with prejudice shall be entered on motion except in cases of
9 excusable neglect. In such cases amendment shall be made by the
10 party in default within a time specified by the court for filing an
11 amended pleading. Within the time allowed by the court for filing
12 an amended pleading, a plaintiff may voluntarily dismiss the action
13 without prejudice.
14 H. MOTION FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT NOT REQUIRED IF DEFENDANT FAILS
15 TO FILE RESPONSE. Nothing in any provision of this title or in any
16 local or district court rule shall be construed to require either a
17 motion or a hearing for default judgment, and no notice shall be
18 necessary, if, after service of summons and petition, a defendant
19 fails to timely file with the court clerk within twenty (20) days a
20 written appearance, answer, motion, pleading, or response as
21 provided in subsection A of this section. Contact or communication
22 with the plaintiff or attorney of the plaintiff shall not constitute
23 an appearance, answer, motion, pleading, or response unless the
24 contact or communication is in writing and is also timely filed by
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2138 Page 7
1 the defendant in writing with the court clerk as provided in
2 subsection A of this section. The provisions of this subsection
3 shall not be construed to prevent an evidentiary hearing concerning
4 the amount of damage to be awarded.
5 SECTION 2. AMENDATORY 12 O.S. 2021, Section 727.1, is
6 amended to read as follows:
7 Section 727.1.

10 judgments of courts of record, including costs and attorney fees
11 authorized by statute or otherwise and allowed by the court, shall
12 bear interest at a rate prescribed pursuant to this section. Such
13 interest shall also apply to the amounts collected on any judgment
14 enforced during the pendency of an appeal which is subsequently
15 overturned on appeal when restitution is paid to the defendant.
16 2. Costs and attorney fees allowed by the court shall bear
17 interest from the earlier of the date the judgment or order is
18 pronounced, if expressly stated in the written judgment or order
19 awarding the costs and attorney fees, or the date the judgment or
20 order is filed with the court clerk.
21 B. Judgments, including costs and attorney fees authorized by
22 statute or otherwise and allowed by the court, against this state or
23 its political subdivisions, including counties, municipalities,
24 school districts, and public trusts of which this state or a
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2138 Page 8
1 poli tical subdivision of this state is a beneficiary, shall bear
2 interest during the term of judgment at a rate prescribed pursuant
3 to this section from the date of rendition. No judgment against
4 this state or its political subdivisions, including counties,
5 municipalities, school districts, and public trusts of which this
6 state or a political subdivision of this state is a beneficiary,
7 inclusive of postjudgment interest, shall exceed the total amount of
8 liability of the governmental entity pursuant to The Governmental
9 Tort Claims Act.
10 C. The postjudgment interest authorized by subsection A or
11 subsection B of this section shall accrue from the earlier of the
12 date the judgment is rendered as expressly stated in the judgment,
13 or the date the judgment is filed with the court clerk, and shall
14 initially accrue at the rate in effect for the calendar year during
15 which the judgment is rendered until the end of the calendar year in
16 which the judgment was rendered, or until the judgment is paid,
17 whichever first occurs. Beginning on January 1 of the next
18 succeeding calendar year until the end of that calendar year, or
19 until the judgment is paid, whichever first occurs, the judgment,
20 together with postjudgment interest previously accrued, shall bear
21 interest at the rate in effect for judgments rendered during that
22 calendar year as certified by the Administrative Director of the
23 Courts pursuant to subsection I of this section. For each
24 succeeding calendar year, or part of a calendar year, during which a
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2138 Page 9
1 judg ment remains unpaid, the judgment, together with postjudgment
2 interest previously accrued, shall bear interest at the rate in
3 effect for judgments rendered during that calendar year as certified
4 by the Administrative Director of the Courts pursuant to subsection
5 I of this section. A separate computation using the interest rate
6 in effect for judgments as provided by subsection I of this section
7 shall be made for each calendar year, or part of a calendar year,
8 during which the judgment remains unpaid in order to determine the
9 total amount of interest for which the judgment debtor is liable.
10 The postjudgment interest rate for each calendar year or part of a
11 calendar year a judgment remains unpaid shall be multiplied by the
12 original amount of the judgment, including any prejudgment interest,
13 together with postjudgment interest previously accrued. Interest
14 shall accrue on a judgment in the manner prescribed by this
15 subsection until the judgment is satisfied or released.
16 D. If a rate of interest is specified in a contract, the rate
17 specified shall apply and be stated in the journal entry of
18 judgment. The rate of interest shall not exceed the lawful rate for
19 that obligation. Postjudgment interest shall be calculated at the
20 contractual rate and accrued in the same manner as prescribed in
21 subsection C of this section.
22 PREJUDGMENT INTEREST
23 E. Except as provided by subsection F of this section,
24 beginning November 1, 2009, if a verdict for damages by reason of

5 trial court, the court in rendering judgment shall add interest on
6 the verdict at a rate prescribed pursuant to subsection I of this
7 section from the date which is twenty-four (24) months after the
8 suit resulting in the judgment was commenced to the earlier of the
9 date the verdict is accepted by the trial court as expressly stated

17 commenced. This rate shall be in effect until the end of the
18 calendar year in which interest begins to accrue or until the date
19 judgment is filed, whichever first occurs. Beginning on January 1
20 of the next succeeding calendar year until the end of that calendar
21 year, or until the date the judgment is filed, whichever first
22 occurs, and for each succeeding calendar year thereafter, the
23 prejudgment interest rate shall be the rate in effect for judgments
24 rendered during each calendar year as certified by the
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2138 Page 11
1 Admi nistrative Director of the Courts pursuant to subsection I of
2 this section. After the computation of all prejudgment interest has
3 been completed, the total amount of prejudgment interest shall be
4 added to the amount of the judgment rendered pursuant to the trial
5 of the action, and the total amount of the resulting judgment shall

9 section is rendered against this state or its political
10 subdivisions, including counties, municipalities, school districts,
11 and public trusts of which this state or a political subdivision of

13 rate prescribed pursuant to subsection I of this section from the
14 date the suit was commenced to the earlier of the date the verdict
15 is accepted by the trial court as expressly stated in the judgment
16 or the date the judgment is filed with the court clerk. The
17 interest rate for computation of prejudgment interest shall begin
18 with the rate prescribed by subsection I of this section which is in
19 effect for the calendar year in which the suit resulting in the
20 judgment is commenced. This rate shall be in effect until the end
21 of the calendar year in which the suit resulting in judgment was
22 filed or until the date the judgment is rendered as expressly stated
23 in the judgment, whichever first occurs. Beginning on January 1 of
24 the next succeeding calendar year until the end of that calendar
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2138 Page 12
1 year , or until the date judgment is rendered, whichever first
2 occurs, and for each succeeding calendar year thereafter, the
3 prejudgment interest rate shall be the rate in effect for judgments
4 rendered during each calendar year as certified by the
5 Administrative Director of the Courts pursuant to subsection I of
6 this section. After the computation of prejudgment interest has
7 been completed, the amount shall be added to the amount of the
8 judgment rendered pursuant to the trial of the action, and the total
9 amount of the resulting judgment shall become the amount upon which
10 postjudgment interest is computed pursuant to subsection B of this
11 section. No award of prejudgment interest against this state or its
12 political subdivisions, including counties, municipalities, school
13 districts, and public trusts of which this state or a political
14 subdivision of this state is a beneficiary, including the amount of
15 the judgment awarded pursuant to trial of the action, shall exceed
16 the total amount of liability of the governmental entity pursuant to

19 for personal injury or injury to personal rights including, but not
20 limited to, injury resulting from bodily restraint, personal insult,
21 defamation, invasion of privacy, injury to personal relations, or
22 detriment due to an act or omission of another, the interest on that
23 award shall begin to accrue from the earlier of the date the
24
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2138 Page 13

11 each calendar year and as certified to the Administrative Director
12 of the Courts by the State Treasurer on the first regular business
13 day following publication in January of each year, plus two percent

16 the average United States Treasury Bill rate of the preceding
17 calendar year as certified to the Administrative Director of the
18 Courts by the State Treasurer on the first regular business day in

12 motion under this section but omits therefrom any defense or
13 objection then available to the party which this section permits to
14 be raised by motion, the party shall not thereafter make a motion
15 based on the defense or objection so omitted, except a motion as
16 provided in paragraph 2 of subsection F of this section on the
17 grounds there stated. The court in its discretion may permit a
18 party to amend a motion by stating additional defenses or objections
19 if an amendment is sought at least five (5) days before the hearing
20 on the motion.
21 F. WAIVER OR PRESERVATION OF CERTAIN DEFENSES.
22 1. A defense of lack of jurisdiction over the person, improper
23 venue, insufficiency of process, insufficiency of service of
24
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2138 Page 5

1 proc ess, failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted,
2 or lack of capacity of a party to be sued is waived:
3 a. if omitted from a motion that raises any of the
4 defenses or objections which this section permits to
5 be raised by motion, or
6 b. if it is not made by motion and it is not included in
7 a responsive pleading or an amendment thereof
8 permitted by subsection A of Section 2015 of this
9 title to be made as a matter of course. A motion to
10 strike an insufficient defense is waived if not raised
11 as in subsection D of this section.
12 2. A defense of failure to join a party indispensable under
13 Section 2019 of this title may be made in any pleading permitted or
14 ordered under subsection A of Section 2007 of this title or at the
15 trial on the merits. A defense of another action pending between
16 the same parties for the same claim or a defense of lack of capacity
17 of a party to sue may be made in any pleading permitted or ordered
18 pursuant to the provisions of subsection A of Section 2007 of this
19 title or at the pretrial conference.
20 3. Whenever it appears by suggestion of the parties or
21 otherwise that the court lacks jurisdiction of the subject matter,
22 the court shall dismiss the action.
23 4. A waiver of the defense in paragraph 6 of subsection B of
24 this section does not preclude a later contention that a party is
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2138 Page 6

1 not entitled to any relief as a matter of law, either by motion for
2 summary judgment, or by demurrer or motion at or after trial.
3 G. FINAL DISMISSAL ON FAILURE TO AMEND. On granting a motion
4 to dismiss a claim for relief, the court shall grant leave to amend
5 if the defect can be remedied and shall specify the time within
6 which an amended pleading shall be filed. If the amended pleading
7 is not filed within the time allowed, final judgment of dismissal
8 with prejudice shall be entered on motion except in cases of
9 excusable neglect. In such cases amendment shall be made by the
10 party in default within a time specified by the court for filing an
11 amended pleading. Within the time allowed by the court for filing
12 an amended pleading, a plaintiff may voluntarily dismiss the action
13 without prejudice.
14 H. MOTION FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT NOT REQUIRED IF DEFENDANT FAILS
15 TO FILE RESPONSE. Nothing in any provision of this title or in any
16 local or district court rule shall be construed to require either a
17 motion or a hearing for default judgment, and no notice shall be
18 necessary, if, after service of summons and petition, a defendant
19 fails to timely file with the court clerk within twenty (20) days a
20 written appearance, answer, motion, pleading, or response as
21 provided in subsection A of this section. Contact or communication
22 with the plaintiff or attorney of the plaintiff shall not constitute
23 an appearance, answer, motion, pleading, or response unless the
24 contact or communication is in writing and is also timely filed by
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2138 Page 7

1 the defendant in writing with the court clerk as provided in
2 subsection A of this section. The provisions of this subsection
3 shall not be construed to prevent an evidentiary hearing concerning
4 the amount of damage to be awarded.
5 SECTION 2. AMENDATORY 12 O.S. 2021, Section 727.1, is
6 amended to read as follows:
7 Section 727.1.
8 POSTJUDGMENT INTEREST
9 A. 1. Except as otherwise provided by this section, all
10 judgments of courts of record, including costs and attorney fees
11 authorized by statute or otherwise and allowed by the court, shall
12 bear interest at a rate prescribed pursuant to this section. Such
13 interest shall also apply to the amounts collected on any judgment
14 enforced during the pendency of an appeal which is subsequently
15 overturned on appeal when restitution is paid to the defendant.
16 2. Costs and attorney fees allowed by the court shall bear
17 interest from the earlier of the date the judgment or order is
18 pronounced, if expressly stated in the written judgment or order
19 awarding the costs and attorney fees, or the date the judgment or
20 order is filed with the court clerk.
21 B. Judgments, including costs and attorney fees authorized by
22 statute or otherwise and allowed by the court, against this state or
23 its political subdivisions, including counties, municipalities,
24 school districts, and public trusts of which this state or a
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2138 Page 8

1 poli tical subdivision of this state is a beneficiary, shall bear
2 interest during the term of judgment at a rate prescribed pursuant
3 to this section from the date of rendition. No judgment against
4 this state or its political subdivisions, including counties,
5 municipalities, school districts, and public trusts of which this
6 state or a political subdivision of this state is a beneficiary,
7 inclusive of postjudgment interest, shall exceed the total amount of
8 liability of the governmental entity pursuant to The Governmental
9 Tort Claims Act.
10 C. The postjudgment interest authorized by subsection A or
11 subsection B of this section shall accrue from the earlier of the
12 date the judgment is rendered as expressly stated in the judgment,
13 or the date the judgment is filed with the court clerk, and shall
14 initially accrue at the rate in effect for the calendar year during
15 which the judgment is rendered until the end of the calendar year in
16 which the judgment was rendered, or until the judgment is paid,
17 whichever first occurs. Beginning on January 1 of the next
18 succeeding calendar year until the end of that calendar year, or
19 until the judgment is paid, whichever first occurs, the judgment,
20 together with postjudgment interest previously accrued, shall bear
21 interest at the rate in effect for judgments rendered during that
22 calendar year as certified by the Administrative Director of the
23 Courts pursuant to subsection I of this section. For each
24 succeeding calendar year, or part of a calendar year, during which a
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2138 Page 9

1 judg ment remains unpaid, the judgment, together with postjudgment
2 interest previously accrued, shall bear interest at the rate in
3 effect for judgments rendered during that calendar year as certified
4 by the Administrative Director of the Courts pursuant to subsection
5 I of this section. A separate computation using the interest rate
6 in effect for judgments as provided by subsection I of this section
7 shall be made for each calendar year, or part of a calendar year,
8 during which the judgment remains unpaid in order to determine the
9 total amount of interest for which the judgment debtor is liable.
10 The postjudgment interest rate for each calendar year or part of a
11 calendar year a judgment remains unpaid shall be multiplied by the
12 original amount of the judgment, including any prejudgment interest,
13 together with postjudgment interest previously accrued. Interest
14 shall accrue on a judgment in the manner prescribed by this
15 subsection until the judgment is satisfied or released.
16 D. If a rate of interest is specified in a contract, the rate
17 specified shall apply and be stated in the journal entry of
18 judgment. The rate of interest shall not exceed the lawful rate for
19 that obligation. Postjudgment interest shall be calculated at the
20 contractual rate and accrued in the same manner as prescribed in
21 subsection C of this section.
22 PREJUDGMENT INTEREST
23 E. Except as provided by subsection F of this section,
24 beginning November 1, 2009, if a verdict for damages by reason of

6 the verdict at a rate prescribed pursuant to subsection I of this
7 section from the date which is twenty-four (24) months after the
8 suit resulting in the judgment was commenced to the earlier of the
9 date the verdict is accepted by the trial court as expressly stated
10 in the judgment, or the date the judgment is filed with the court
11 clerk. No prejudgment interest shall begin to accrue until twenty-
12 four (24) months after the suit resulting in the judgment was
13 commenced. The interest rate for computation of prejudgment
14 interest shall begin with the rate prescribed by subsection I of
15 this section which is in effect for the calendar year which is
16 twenty-four (24) months after the suit resulting in the judgment was
17 commenced. This rate shall be in effect until the end of the
18 calendar year in which interest begins to accrue or until the date
19 judgment is filed, whichever first occurs. Beginning on January 1
20 of the next succeeding calendar year until the end of that calendar
21 year, or until the date the judgment is filed, whichever first
22 occurs, and for each succeeding calendar year thereafter, the
23 prejudgment interest rate shall be the rate in effect for judgments
24 rendered during each calendar year as certified by the
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2138 Page 11

1 Admi nistrative Director of the Courts pursuant to subsection I of
2 this section. After the computation of all prejudgment interest has
3 been completed, the total amount of prejudgment interest shall be
4 added to the amount of the judgment rendered pursuant to the trial
5 of the action, and the total amount of the resulting judgment shall
6 become the amount upon which postjudgment interest is computed
7 pursuant to subsection A of this section.
8 F. If a verdict of the type described by subsection E of this
9 section is rendered against this state or its political
10 subdivisions, including counties, municipalities, school districts,
11 and public trusts of which this state or a political subdivision of
12 this state is a beneficiary, the judgment shall bear interest at the
13 rate prescribed pursuant to subsection I of this section from the
14 date the suit was commenced to the earlier of the date the verdict
15 is accepted by the trial court as expressly stated in the judgment
16 or the date the judgment is filed with the court clerk. The
17 interest rate for computation of prejudgment interest shall begin
18 with the rate prescribed by subsection I of this section which is in
19 effect for the calendar year in which the suit resulting in the
20 judgment is commenced. This rate shall be in effect until the end
21 of the calendar year in which the suit resulting in judgment was
22 filed or until the date the judgment is rendered as expressly stated
23 in the judgment, whichever first occurs. Beginning on January 1 of
24 the next succeeding calendar year until the end of that calendar
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2138 Page 12

1 year , or until the date judgment is rendered, whichever first
2 occurs, and for each succeeding calendar year thereafter, the
3 prejudgment interest rate shall be the rate in effect for judgments
4 rendered during each calendar year as certified by the
5 Administrative Director of the Courts pursuant to subsection I of
6 this section. After the computation of prejudgment interest has
7 been completed, the amount shall be added to the amount of the
8 judgment rendered pursuant to the trial of the action, and the total
9 amount of the resulting judgment shall become the amount upon which
10 postjudgment interest is computed pursuant to subsection B of this
11 section. No award of prejudgment interest against this state or its
12 political subdivisions, including counties, municipalities, school
13 districts, and public trusts of which this state or a political
14 subdivision of this state is a beneficiary, including the amount of
15 the judgment awarded pursuant to trial of the action, shall exceed
16 the total amount of liability of the governmental entity pursuant to
17 The Governmental Tort Claims Act.
18 G. If exemplary or punitive damages are awarded in an action
19 for personal injury or injury to personal rights including, but not
20 limited to, injury resulting from bodily restraint, personal insult,
21 defamation, invasion of privacy, injury to personal relations, or

23 award shall begin to accrue from the earlier of the date the
