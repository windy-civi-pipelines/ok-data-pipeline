8 defendant may file a reservation of time which shall

1 5. The service of a motion permitted under this section or a
2 motion for summary judgment alters these periods of time as follows:
3 if the court denies the motion or postpones its disposition until
4 the trial on the merits, the responsive pleading shall be served

6 different time is fixed by order of the court.
7 B. HOW PRESENTED. Every defense, in law or fact, to a claim
8 for relief in any pleading, whether a claim, counterclaim, cross-
9 claim, or third-party claim, shall be asserted in the responsive

11 defenses may at the option of the pleader be made by motion:
12 1. Lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter;
13 2. Lack of jurisdiction over the person;
14 3. Improper venue;
15 4. Insufficiency of process;
16 5. Insufficiency of service of process;

HB2138 HFLR Page 3
BOLD FACE denotes Committee Amendments.
1 waiv ed by being joined with one or more other defenses or objections
2 in a responsive pleading or motion. If a pleading sets forth a
3 claim for relief to which the adverse party is not required to serve
4 a responsive pleading, the adverse party may assert at the trial any
5 defense in law or fact to that claim for relief. If, on a motion
6 asserting the defense numbered 6 of this subsection to dismiss for
7 failure of the pleading to state a claim upon which relief can be
8 granted, matters outside the pleading are presented to and not
9 excluded by the court, the motion shall be treated as one for
10 summary judgment and all parties shall be given reasonable
11 opportunity to present all material made pertinent to the motion by
12 the rules for summary judgment. A motion to dismiss for failure to
13 state a claim upon which relief can be granted shall separately
14 state each omission or defect in the petition, and a motion that
15 does not specify such defects or omissions shall be denied without a
16 hearing and the defendant shall answer within twenty (20) days after

21 in subsection D of this section shall be heard and determined before
22 trial on application of any party, unless the court orders that the
23 hearing and determination thereof be deferred until the trial. If
24 the court determines that venue is proper, the action shall not be
HB2138 HFLR Page 4
BOLD FACE denotes Committee Amendments.
1 dism issed for improper venue as a result of the jury's verdict or
2 the subsequent ruling of the court on a demurrer to the evidence or
3 a motion for a directed verdict.
4 D. MOTION TO STRIKE. Upon motion made by a party before
5 responding to a pleading or, if no responsive pleading is permitted
6 by this act, upon motion made by a party within twenty (20) days
7 after the service of the pleading upon the party or upon the court's
8 own initiative at any time, the court may order stricken from any
9 pleading any insufficient defense. If, on a motion to strike an
10 insufficient defense, matters outside the pleadings are presented to
11 and not excluded by the court, the motion shall be treated as one
12 for partial summary judgment and all parties shall be given
13 reasonable opportunity to present all materials made pertinent to
14 the motion by the rules for summary judgment.
15 E. CONSOLIDATION OF DEFENSES IN MOTION. A party who makes a
16 motion under this section may join with it any other motions herein
17 provided for and then available to the party. If a party makes a
18 motion under this section but omits therefrom any defense or
19 objection then available to the party which this section permits to
20 be raised by motion, the party shall not thereafter make a motion
21 based on the defense or objection so omitted, except a motion as
22 provided in paragraph 2 of subsection F of this section on the
23 grounds there stated. The court in its discretion may permit a
24 party to amend a motion by stating additional defenses or objections
HB2138 HFLR Page 5
BOLD FACE denotes Committee Amendments.
1 if a n amendment is sought at least five (5) days before the hearing
2 on the motion.
3 F. WAIVER OR PRESERVATION OF CERTAIN DEFENSES.
4 1. A defense of lack of jurisdiction over the person, improper
5 venue, insufficiency of process, insufficiency of service of
6 process, failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted,
7 or lack of capacity of a party to be sued is waived:
8 a. if omitted from a motion that raises any of the
9 defenses or objections which this section permits to
10 be raised by motion, or
11 b. if it is not made by motion and it is not included in
12 a responsive pleading or an amendment thereof
13 permitted by subsection A of Section 2015 of this
14 title to be made as a matter of course. A motion to
15 strike an insufficient defense is waived if not raised
16 as in subsection D of this section.
17 2. A defense of failure to join a party indispensable under
18 Section 2019 of this title may be made in any pleading permitted or
19 ordered under subsection A of Section 2007 of this title or at the
20 trial on the merits. A defense of another action pending between
21 the same parties for the same claim or a defense of lack of capacity
22 of a party to sue may be made in any pleading permitted or ordered
23 pursuant to the provisions of subsection A of Section 2007 of this
24 title or at the pretrial conference.
HB2138 HFLR Page 6
BOLD FACE denotes Committee Amendments.
1 3. Whenever it appears by suggestion of the parties or
2 otherwise that the court lacks jurisdiction of the subject matter,
3 the court shall dismiss the action.
4 4. A waiver of the defense in paragraph 6 of subsection B of
5 this section does not preclude a later contention that a party is
6 not entitled to any relief as a matter of law, either by motion for
7 summary judgment, or by demurrer or motion at or after trial.
8 G. FINAL DISMISSAL ON FAILURE TO AMEND. On granting a motion
9 to dismiss a claim for relief, the court shall grant leave to amend
10 if the defect can be remedied and shall specify the time within
11 which an amended pleading shall be filed. If the amended pleading
12 is not filed within the time allowed, final judgment of dismissal
13 with prejudice shall be entered on motion except in cases of
14 excusable neglect. In such cases amendment shall be made by the
15 party in default within a time specified by the court for filing an
16 amended pleading. Within the time allowed by the court for filing
17 an amended pleading, a plaintiff may voluntarily dismiss the action
18 without prejudice.
19 H. MOTION FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT NOT REQUIRED IF DEFENDANT FAILS
20 TO FILE RESPONSE. Nothing in any provision of this title or in any
21 local or district court rule shall be construed to require either a
22 motion or a hearing for default judgment, and no notice shall be
23 necessary, if, after service of summons and petition, a defendant
24 fails to timely file with the court clerk within twenty (20) days a

1 writ ten appears, answer, motion, pleading, or response as provided
2 in subsection A of this section. Contact or communication with the
3 plaintiff or attorney of the plaintiff shall not constitute an
4 appearance, answer, motion, pleading, or response unless the contact
5 or communication is in writing and is also timely filed by the
6 defendant in writing with the court clerk as provided in subsection
7 A of this section. The provisions of this subsection shall not be
8 construed to prevent an evidentiary hearing concerning the amount of
9 damage to be awarded.
10 SECTION 2. AMENDATORY 12 O.S. 2021, Section 727.1, is
11 amended to read as follows:

11 and not excluded by the court, the motion shall be treated as one
12 for partial summary judgment and all parties shall be given
13 reasonable opportunity to present all materials made pertinent to
14 the motion by the rules for summary judgment.
15 E. CONSOLIDATION OF DEFENSES IN MOTION. A party who makes a
16 motion under this section may join with it any other motions herein
17 provided for and then available to the party. If a party makes a
18 motion under this section but omits therefrom any defense or
19 objection then available to the party which this section permits to
20 be raised by motion, the party shall not thereafter make a motion
21 based on the defense or objection so omitted, except a motion as
22 provided in paragraph 2 of subsection F of this section on the
23 grounds there stated. The court in its discretion may permit a
24 party to amend a motion by stating additional defenses or objections

1 if a n amendment is sought at least five (5) days before the hearing
2 on the motion.
3 F. WAIVER OR PRESERVATION OF CERTAIN DEFENSES.
4 1. A defense of lack of jurisdiction over the person, improper
5 venue, insufficiency of process, insufficiency of service of
6 process, failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted,
7 or lack of capacity of a party to be sued is waived:
8 a. if omitted from a motion that raises any of the
9 defenses or objections which this section permits to
10 be raised by motion, or
11 b. if it is not made by motion and it is not included in
12 a responsive pleading or an amendment thereof
13 permitted by subsection A of Section 2015 of this
14 title to be made as a matter of course. A motion to
15 strike an insufficient defense is waived if not raised
16 as in subsection D of this section.
17 2. A defense of failure to join a party indispensable under
18 Section 2019 of this title may be made in any pleading permitted or
19 ordered under subsection A of Section 2007 of this title or at the
20 trial on the merits. A defense of another action pending between
21 the same parties for the same claim or a defense of lack of capacity
22 of a party to sue may be made in any pleading permitted or ordered
23 pursuant to the provisions of subsection A of Section 2007 of this
24 title or at the pretrial conference.

1 3. Whenever it appears by suggestion of the parties or
2 otherwise that the court lacks jurisdiction of the subject matter,
3 the court shall dismiss the action.
4 4. A waiver of the defense in paragraph 6 of subsection B of
5 this section does not preclude a later contention that a party is
6 not entitled to any relief as a matter of law, either by motion for
7 summary judgment, or by demurrer or motion at or after trial.
8 G. FINAL DISMISSAL ON FAILURE TO AMEND. On granting a motion
9 to dismiss a claim for relief, the court shall grant leave to amend
10 if the defect can be remedied and shall specify the time within
11 which an amended pleading shall be filed. If the amended pleading
12 is not filed within the time allowed, final judgment of dismissal
13 with prejudice shall be entered on motion except in cases of
14 excusable neglect. In such cases amendment shall be made by the
15 party in default within a time specified by the court for filing an
16 amended pleading. Within the time allowed by the court for filing
17 an amended pleading, a plaintiff may voluntarily dismiss the action
18 without prejudice.
19 H. MOTION FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT NOT REQUIRED IF DEFENDANT FAILS
20 TO FILE RESPONSE. Nothing in any provision of this title or in any
21 local or district court rule shall be construed to require either a
22 motion or a hearing for default judgment, and no notice shall be
23 necessary, if, after service of summons and petition, a defendant
24 fails to timely file with the court clerk within twenty (20) days a

4 appearance, answer, motion, pleading, or response unless the contact
5 or communication is in writing and is also timely filed by the
6 defendant in writing with the court clerk as provided in subsection
7 A of this section. The provisions of this subsection shall not be
8 construed to prevent an evidentiary hearing concerning the amount of
9 damage to be awarded.

11 amended to read as follows:

8 interest previously accrued, shall bear interest at the rate in
9 effect for judgments rendered during that calendar year as certified
