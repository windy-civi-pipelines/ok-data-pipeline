13 WHEREAS, Rosie the Riveter Day is celebrated on March 21 to
14 recognize the part American women played in America's victory in
15 World War II. As the war raged on in the early 1940s, able-bodied

18 gone down in history to be remembered as The Greatest Generation;
19 WHEREAS, in 2017, the United States Congress passed a resolution
20 to mark March 21 as National Rosie the Riveter Day, a day during

23 millions of women who left their homes for factories to keep the
24 country's manufacturing processes going;

1 WHEREAS, during the Second World War, when every able-bodied man
2 was sent to fight for the Allies, the nation's manufacturing leg

4 ports, every male-dominated industry came short of personnel due to
5 abrupt drafting;
6 WHEREAS, the federal government issued propaganda to encourage
7 women to join the industrial workforce as a patriotic duty during
8 this time. The iconic poster included a woman in a red bandana
9 raising her fist when used to recruit women;
10 WHEREAS, the total number of female industrial workers went from
11 twenty-seven percent (27%) to thirty-seven percent (37%) between
12 1940 and 1945; more than 19 million women held jobs outside of the
13 traditional women's workforce for the first time ever. Rosie became
14 a cultural icon;
15 WHEREAS, the Rosie the Riveter campaign proved to change the
16 nature of women's involvement in the workforce. This resolution
17 acknowledges the vital role played by women during the Second World
18 War.

20 OF THE 1ST SESSION OF THE 60TH OKLAHOMA LEGISLATURE:
