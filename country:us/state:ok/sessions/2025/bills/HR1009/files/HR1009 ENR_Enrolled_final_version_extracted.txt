Riveter Day; and expressing the significance of the
role women played in the Second World War.
WHEREAS, Rosie the Riveter Day is celebrated on March 21 to
recognize the part American women played in America's victory in
World War II. As the war raged on in the early 1940s, able-bodied
men were drafted to fight, and the female population was called upon
to support the workforce. These courageous men and women have since
gone down in history to be remembered as The Greatest Generation;
WHEREAS, in 2017, the United States Congress passed a resolution
to mark March 21 as National Rosie the Riveter Day, a day during
Women's History Month;
WHEREAS, the symbolism of Rosie the Riveter stands for the
millions of women who left their homes for factories to keep the
country's manufacturing processes going;
WHEREAS, during the Second World War, when every able-bodied man
was sent to fight for the Allies, the nation's manufacturing leg
came to a halt. From heavy machinery to steel mills and freight
ports, every male-dominated industry came short of personnel due to
abrupt drafting;
WHEREAS, the federal government issued propaganda to encourage
women to join the industrial workforce as a patriotic duty during
this time. The iconic poster included a woman in a red bandana
raising her fist when used to recruit women;
WHEREAS, the total number of female industrial workers went from
twenty-seven percent (27%) to thirty-seven percent (37%) between
1940 and 1945; more than 19 million women held jobs outside of the
traditional women's workforce for the first time ever. Rosie became
a cultural icon;
WHEREAS, the Rosie the Riveter campaign proved to change the
nature of women's involvement in the workforce. This resolution
acknowledges the vital role played by women during the Second World
War.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
OF THE 1ST SESSION OF THE 60TH OKLAHOMA LEGISLATURE:
THAT this resolution acknowledges the vital role played by women
during the Second World War;
THAT March 21, 2025, is hereby recognized by the Oklahoma House
of Representatives and the State of Oklahoma as Rosie the Riveter
Day.
Adopted by the House of Representatives the 13th day of March,
