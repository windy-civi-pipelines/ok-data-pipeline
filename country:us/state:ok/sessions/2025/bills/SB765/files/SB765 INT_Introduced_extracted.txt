INTERSTATE DENTAL AND DENTAL HYGIENE COMPACT

A. This Compact shall be known as the Interstate Dental and
7
8
Dental Hygiene Compact. The purpose of the Compact is to expedite
8
9
licensure and increase access to dental health care through state
9
10
licensing agencies acting in cooperation. The Compact adopts the
10
11
existing structures most utilized by state licensing agencies across
11
12
the United States, while ensuring the safety of the public through
12
13
the sharing of documents and information. The Compact ensures that
13
14
each state retains the right to impose an adverse action on a
14
15
licensee as a home state or as a practicing state. Each state has
15
16
an opportunity to share investigations and information with the home
16
17
state of licensure. The Compact is administered by state licensing
17
18
agencies, thus allowing for each state to maintain its sovereignty.

6
INTERSTATE DENTAL AND DENTAL HYGIENE COMPACT
6
7
A. This Compact shall be known as the Interstate Dental and
7
8
Dental Hygiene Compact. The purpose of the Compact is to expedite
8
9
licensure and increase access to dental health care through state
9
10
licensing agencies acting in cooperation. The Compact adopts the
10
11
existing structures most utilized by state licensing agencies across
11
12
the United States, while ensuring the safety of the public through
12
13
the sharing of documents and information. The Compact ensures that
13
14
each state retains the right to impose an adverse action on a
14
15
licensee as a home state or as a practicing state. Each state has
15
16
an opportunity to share investigations and information with the home
16
17
state of licensure. The Compact is administered by state licensing
17
18
agencies, thus allowing for each state to maintain its sovereignty.
18
19
B. The Interstate Dental and Dental Hygiene Compact:
19
20
1. Allows for expedited licensure portability and ease of
20
21
movement between states;
21
22
2. Allows each state to continue to regulate the practice of
22
23
dentistry and dental hygiene within its borders and maintain its
23
24
sovereignty by allowing actions against a Compact license privilege
24
Req. No. 1200 Page 2

1
or a licensee and maintaining its existing licensure structure while
1
2
allowing for Compact licensure privileges;
2
3
3. Creates a common goal of protecting the public by ensuring a
3
4
uniform licensure standard and the sharing of information in the
4
5
Compact;
5
6
4. Allows for licensure in every participating state by passing
6
7
a uniform licensure examination that tests psychomotor and cognitive
7
8
dental skills exam that is currently accepted in fifty state
8
9
licensing jurisdictions and United States territories;
9
10
5. Gives licensees one location to maintain professional
10
11
documentation to expedite Compact license privileges in member
11
12
states;
12
13
6. Facilitates a faster licensure process for relocation or
13
14
separation of military members and their dependent spouses. There
14
15
are no Compact fees for military members or their spouses;
15
16
7. Alleviates a duplicative process for licensure among
16
17
multiple states;
17
18
8. Saves applicants money by not having to obtain duplicate
18
19
documents from a source that charges for the documents; and
19
20
9. Utilizes existing infrastructure of the American Association
20
21
of Dental Boards, which has been in existence for over one hundred
21
22
(100) years representing dental licensing agencies.
