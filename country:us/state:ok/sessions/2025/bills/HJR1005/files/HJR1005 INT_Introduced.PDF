16 1ST SESSION OF THE 60TH OKLAHOMA LEGISLATURE:
17 SECTION 1. The Secretary of State shall refer to the people for
18 their approval or rejection, as and in the manner provided by law,
19 the following proposed amendment to Section 8C of Article X of the
20 Constitution of the State of Oklahoma to read as follows:
21 Section 8C. A. Despite any provision to the contrary,
22 beginning January 1, 2005 2026, the fair cash value, as determined
23 by law, on each homestead of an individual head of household whose
24 gross household income from all sources for the preceding calendar

1 year did not exceed an amount as provided in subsection B of this
2 section, and which individual head of household who is sixty-five
3 (65) years of age or older who has occupied the property for a
4 period of at least ten (10) years prior to the first January 1 date
5 following the year during which the person attains the age of sixty-
6 five (65) years, shall not exceed the fair cash value placed upon
7 the property during the first year in which the individual head of
8 household was sixty-five (65) years of age or older and had gross
9 household income from all sources which did not exceed an amount as
10 provided in subsection B of this section. For purposes of this
11 section, absence from the homestead for a period not to exceed three
12 hundred sixty-five (365) days during any ten-year period shall not
13 disqualify the owner from eligibility. The provisions of this
14 section shall only be applicable to a homestead with a fair cash
15 value of Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000.00) or less. For
16 purposes of this section, the fair cash value shall be determined in
17 the same manner as provided by Section 8B of Article X of the
18 Oklahoma Constitution. Subject to the limitations of this section,
19 the fair cash value shall not exceed such amount as long as the
20 individual head of household who is sixty-five (65) years of age or
21 older owns and occupies the property and as long as the gross
22 household income from all sources does not exceed an amount as
23 provided in subsection B of this section. If any improvements are
24 made to the property, the fair cash value of the improvements shall

1 be a ssessed in accordance with law by the county assessor and added
2 to the assessed value of the property. Once the fair cash value of
3 the improvements has been added to the fair cash value of the
4 property, the total fair cash value shall not exceed the revised
5 valuation of the property so long as the individual head of
6 household who is sixty-five (65) years of age or older owns and
7 occupies the property and so long as the gross household income from
8 all sources does not exceed an amount as provided in subsection B of
9 this section. For any individual head of household who is sixty-
10 five (65) years of age or older prior to January 1, 1997, and has
11 gross household income from all sources of Twenty-five Thousand
12 Dollars ($25,000.00) or less in calendar year 1996, the fair cash
13 value of the real property shall be the fair cash value placed upon
14 the property on January 1, 1997. If the individual head of
15 household ceases to own and occupy the property or if the gross
16 household income from all sources exceeds an amount as provided in
17 subsection B of this section, the fair cash value of the property
18 shall be determined as if the provisions of Section 8 of Article X
19 of the Constitution of the State of Oklahoma or any other provisions
20 relating to a limitation on the fair cash value of locally assessed
21 real property had been in effect during the time the property was
22 valued pursuant to the provisions of this section.
23 B. The income threshold for the gross household income from all
24 sources for an individual head of household under this section shall

1 not exceed the amount determined by the United States Department of
2 Housing and Urban Development to be the estimated median income for
3 the preceding year for the county or metropolitan statistical area
4 which includes such county. The Oklahoma Tax Commission shall
5 provide such information to each county assessor each year as soon
6 as such information becomes available.
7 SECTION 2. The Ballot Title for the proposed Constitutional
8 amendment as set forth in SECTION 1 of this resolution shall be in
9 the following form:
10 BALLOT TITLE
11 Legislative Referendum No. ____ State Question No. ____
12 THE GIST OF THE PROPOSITION IS AS FOLLOWS:
13 This measure amends Section 8C of Article 10 of the Oklahoma
14 Constitution. Increases in fair cash value of homesteads
15 are limited for individual heads of household age sixty-five
16 (65) or older. The increase cannot exceed the fair cash
17 value of the property during the first year in which the
18 owner was age sixty-five (65) years of age or older. This
19 limit applies if the individual head of household meets both
20 the age requirement and an income limit determined by the
21 United States Department of Housing and Urban Development.
22 This measure would eliminate the income limit requirement.
23 The age limit would not change. The person would be
24 required to have occupied the homestead for ten (10) years.

1 A person could be away from the homestead for a period not
2 to exceed three hundred sixty-five (365) days in a ten-year
3 period and still qualify. The limit on increases in fair
4 cash value of homestead property would only apply if the
5 fair cash value of the homestead is Five Hundred Thousand
6 Dollars ($500,000.00) or less. This value would be
7 determined the same way as it is determined for all other
8 purposes in the property tax system.

12 SECTION 3. The Chief Clerk of the House of Representatives,
