A. The purpose of the Oklahoma Elder Exploitation and Abuse Act
is to promote the general welfare of all citizens by establishing a
civil action for incapacitated persons and vulnerable adults which
provides for the protection of their rights and affords them a right
of civil action against those who neglect, exploit, or abuse them.
B. The purpose of the Oklahoma Elder Exploitation and Abuse Act
is to allow incapacitated persons and vulnerable adults, through
their legal representatives, to pursue claims against persons who
neglect, exploit, or abuse the incapacitated person or vulnerable
adult if he or she lacks the capacity to pursue such claims on his
or her own behalf.
C. The Oklahoma Elder Exploitation and Abuse Act does not
preclude an individual's mandatory responsibility to report to Adult
Protective Services or law enforcement if there is reasonable cause
to believe a vulnerable adult is being abused, neglected, or
exploited.
D. It is the intent of the Oklahoma Legislature:
1. That the district court shall exercise the authority
conferred by the Oklahoma Elder Exploitation and Abuse Act to
encourage the development of maximum self-reliance and independence
of incapacitated persons and vulnerable adults and make appointive
and other orders only to the extent necessitated by the mental and
adaptive limitations of other conditions of the incapacitated or
partially incapacitated person warranting the action; and
2. That in performing their duties and exercising their powers,
legal representatives bringing claims under this act for
incapacitated persons and vulnerable adults shall:
a. assure, to the extent reasonably possible, that the
rights of the persons for whom they are appointed are
protected, and
