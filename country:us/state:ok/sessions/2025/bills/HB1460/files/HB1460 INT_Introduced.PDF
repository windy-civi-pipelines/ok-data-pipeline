10 immediately upon release from incarceration or if parole is granted
11 and shall not be limited to two (2) years. Provided further, any
12 supervision provided for in this section may be extended for a
13 period not to exceed the expiration of the maximum term or terms of
14 the sentence upon a determination by the court or the Division of

Req. No. 11825 Page 31

1 cond itions prescribed by the court not to exceed a seven-year
2 period, except as authorized under subsection B of this section.
3 The court shall first consider restitution among the various

6 1. Pay court costs;
7 2. Pay an assessment in lieu of any fine authorized by law for
8 the offense;
9 3. Pay any other assessment or cost authorized by law;

24 month. The supervision fee shall be waived in whole or part by the
Req. No. 11825 Page 32

1 supe rvisory agency when the accused is indigent. Any fees collected
2 by the district attorney pursuant to this paragraph shall be
3 deposited in the General Revenue Fund of the State Treasury. No
4 person shall be denied supervision based solely on the inability of
5 the person to pay a fee;
6 8. Pay into the court fund a monthly amount not exceeding Forty
7 Dollars ($40.00) per month during any period during which the
8 proceedings are deferred when the defendant is not to be supervised
9 in the community. The total amount to be paid into the court fund
10 shall be established by the court and shall not exceed the amount of
11 the maximum fine authorized by law for the offense;
12 9. Make other reparations to the community or victim as
13 required and deemed appropriate by the court;
14 10. Order any conditions which can be imposed for a suspended

3 prosecution in its entirety. However, if the court determines that
4 a reduction in the fine, costs and costs of prosecution is
5 warranted, the court shall equally apply the same percentage
6 reduction to the fine, costs and costs of prosecution owed by the
7 offender. Any fees collected by the district attorney pursuant to
8 this paragraph shall be deposited in the General Revenue Fund of the
9 State Treasury.

6 Health and Substance Abuse Services shall establish a fee schedule,
7 based upon the ability of a person to pay, provided the fee for an
8 evaluation shall not exceed Seventy-five Dollars ($75.00). The
9 evaluation shall be conducted at a certified facility, the office of
10 a qualified practitioner or at another location as ordered by the
11 court. The facility or qualified practitioner shall, within

18 person evaluated pursuant to this subsection for any treatment
19 program or alcohol and drug substance abuse service in which the

6 of the court to obtain the evaluation required by this subsection.
7 As used in this subsection, "qualified practitioner" means a person
8 with at least a bachelor's degree in substance abuse treatment,

14 person who does not meet the requirements for a qualified
15 practitioner as defined herein, but who has been previously
16 certified by the Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse
17 Services to provide alcohol or drug treatment or assessments, shall
18 be considered a qualified practitioner provided all education,
19 experience and certification requirements stated herein are met by

7 the defendant, if in the opinion of the court the defendant has the
8 ability to pay such fee.
9 D. Upon completion of the conditions of the deferred judgment,
10 and upon a finding by the court that the conditions have been met
11 and all fines, fees, and monetary assessments have been paid as
12 ordered, the defendant shall be discharged without a court judgment
13 of guilt, and the court shall order the verdict or plea of guilty or
14 plea of nolo contendere to be expunged from the record and the

10 section shall not be mutually exclusive of Section 18 of this title.
11 Records expunged pursuant to this subsection shall be sealed to
12 the public but not to law enforcement agencies for law enforcement

14 admissible in any subsequent criminal prosecution to prove the
15 existence of a prior conviction or prior deferred judgment without
16 the necessity of a court order requesting the unsealing of such
17 records.
18 E. The provisions of subsection D of this section shall be
19 retroactive.
20 F. Whenever a judgment has been deferred by the court according
21 to the provisions of this section, deferred judgment may not be

23 forth the grounds for such acceleration is filed by the district
24 attorney with the clerk of the sentencing court and competent

5 and the defendant. Any acceleration of a deferred sentence based on
6 a technical violation shall not exceed ninety (90) days for a first
7 acceleration or five (5) years for a second or subsequent
8 acceleration.
9 G. Upon any violation of the deferred judgment, other than a
10 technical violation, the court may enter a judgment of guilt and
11 proceed as provided in Section 991a of this title or may modify any
12 condition imposed. Provided, however, if the deferred judgment is
13 for a felony offense, and the defendant commits another felony
14 offense, the defendant shall not be allowed bail pending appeal.
15 H. The deferred judgment procedure described in this section
16 shall apply only to defendants who have not been previously
17 convicted of a felony offense and have not received more than one
18 deferred judgment for a felony offense within the ten (10) years
19 previous to the commission of the pending offense.

3 J. All defendants who are supervised pursuant to this section
4 shall be subject to the sanction process as established in
5 subsection D of Section 991b of this title.
6 K. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections F and G of
7 this section, a person who is being considered for an acceleration

9 subsequently been lowered to a misdemeanor shall only be subject to
10 a judgment and sentence that would have been applicable had he or
