11 and shall not be limited to two (2) years. Provided further, any
12 supervision provided for in this section may be extended for a

Req. No. 2046 Page 39
1 cond itions prescribed by the court not to exceed a seven-year
2 period, except as authorized under subsection B of this section.
3 The court shall first consider restitution among the various
4 conditions it may prescribe. The court may also consider ordering
5 the defendant to:
6 1. Pay court costs;
7 2. Pay an assessment in lieu of any fine authorized by law for
8 the offense;
9 3. Pay any other assessment or cost authorized by law;
10 4. Engage in a term of community service without compensation,

12 responsibilities of the defendant;
13 5. County jail confinement for a period not to exceed ninety

17 to be paid into the court fund, if a court-appointed attorney has

24 month. The supervision fee shall be waived in whole or part by the
Req. No. 2046 Page 40
1 supe rvisory agency when the accused is indigent. Any fees collected
2 by the district attorney pursuant to this paragraph shall be
3 deposited in the General Revenue Fund of the State Treasury. No
4 person shall be denied supervision based solely on the inability of
5 the person to pay a fee;
6 8. Pay into the court fund a monthly amount not exceeding Forty
7 Dollars ($40.00) per month during any period during which the

5 a reduction in the fine, costs and costs of prosecution is
6 warranted, the court shall equally apply the same percentage
7 reduction to the fine, costs and costs of prosecution owed by the
8 offender the same manner as the court waives financial obligations
9 pursuant to Section 983 of this title. Any unpaid costs of
10 prosecution shall be waived if the deferred sentence of an offender
11 expires without being accelerated. Any fees collected by the

Req. No. 2046 Page 41

2 any part of this requirement in the best interests of justice. The
3 court shall not may waive, suspend, defer or dismiss the costs of
4 prosecution in its entirety. However, if the court determines that
5 a reduction in the fine, costs and costs of prosecution is
6 warranted, the court shall equally apply the same percentage
7 reduction to the fine, costs and costs of prosecution owed by the

7 evaluating the receptivity to treatment and prognosis of the person.
8 The court shall order the person to reimburse the facility or
9 qualified practitioner for the evaluation. The Department of Mental
10 Health and Substance Abuse Services shall establish a fee schedule,
11 based upon the ability of a person to pay, provided the fee for an
12 evaluation shall not exceed Seventy-five Dollars ($75.00). The
13 evaluation shall be conducted at a certified facility, the office of
14 a qualified practitioner or at another location as ordered by the
15 court. The facility or qualified practitioner shall, within
16 seventy-two (72) hours from the time the person is assessed, submit
17 a written report to the court for the purpose of assisting the court
18 in its determination of conditions for deferred sentence. No

20 abuse evaluation program certified by the Department of Mental
21 Health and Substance Abuse Services shall solicit or refer any
22 person evaluated pursuant to this subsection for any treatment
23 program or alcohol and drug substance abuse service in which the
24 person, agency or facility has a vested interest; however, this
Req. No. 2046 Page 43

1 prov ision shall not be construed to prohibit the court from ordering
2 participation in or any person from voluntarily utilizing a
3 treatment program or alcohol and drug substance abuse service
4 offered by such person, agency or facility. Any evaluation report
5 submitted to the court pursuant to this subsection shall be handled
6 in a manner which will keep the report confidential from review by
7 the general public. Nothing contained in this subsection shall be
8 construed to prohibit the court from ordering judgment and sentence
9 in the event the defendant fails or refuses to comply with an order
10 of the court to obtain the evaluation required by this subsection.
11 As used in this subsection, “qualified practitioner” means a person
12 with at least a bachelor’s degree in substance abuse treatment,

14 years of experience in providing alcohol abuse treatment, other drug
15 abuse treatment, or both alcohol and other drug abuse treatment who
16 is certified each year by the Department of Mental Health and

18 person who does not meet the requirements for a qualified
19 practitioner as defined herein, but who has been previously
20 certified by the Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse
21 Services to provide alcohol or drug treatment or assessments, shall

10 victims impact panel program to offset the cost of participation by
11 the defendant, if in the opinion of the court the defendant has the
12 ability to pay such fee.
13 D. Upon completion of the conditions of the deferred judgment,
14 and upon a finding by the court that the conditions have been met
15 and all fines, fees, and monetary assessments have been paid as
16 ordered, the defendant shall be discharged without a court judgment
17 of guilt, and the court shall order the verdict or plea of guilty or
18 plea of nolo contendere to be expunged from the record and the

8 district court or upon written request by the named defendant to the

10 of the defendant with the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation;
11 and
12 5. Defendants qualifying under Section 18 of this title may
13 petition the court to have the filing of the indictment and the
14 dismissal expunged from the public index and docket sheet. This
15 section shall not be mutually exclusive of Section 18 of this title.
16 Records expunged pursuant to this subsection shall be sealed to
17 the public but not to law enforcement agencies for law enforcement
18 purposes. Records expunged pursuant to this subsection shall be
19 admissible in any subsequent criminal prosecution to prove the

21 the necessity of a court order requesting the unsealing of such
22 records.

24 retroactive.
Req. No. 2046 Page 46

4 forth the grounds for such acceleration is filed by the district
5 attorney with the clerk of the sentencing court and competent
6 evidence justifying the acceleration of the judgment is presented to
7 the court at a hearing to be held for that purpose. The hearing
8 shall be held not more than twenty (20) days after the entry of the
9 plea of not guilty to the petition, unless waived by both the state

11 a technical violation shall not exceed ninety (90) days for a first
12 acceleration or five (5) years for a second or subsequent
13 acceleration.
14 G. Upon any violation of the deferred judgment, other than a
15 technical violation, the court may enter a judgment of guilt and
16 proceed as provided in Section 991a of this title or may modify any
17 condition imposed. Provided, however, if the deferred judgment is
18 for a felony offense, and the defendant commits another felony
19 offense, the defendant shall not be allowed bail pending appeal.
20 H. The deferred judgment procedure described in this section
21 shall apply only to defendants who have not been previously
22 convicted of a felony offense and have not received more than one
