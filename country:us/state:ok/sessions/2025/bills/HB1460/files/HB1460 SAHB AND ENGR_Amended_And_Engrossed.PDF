1 duri ng the prosecution of the offender and for the additional work
2 of verifying the compliance of the offender with the rules and
3 conditions of his or her probation. The district attorney may waive
4 any part of this requirement in the best interests of justice. The
5 court shall not may waive, suspend, defer or dismiss the costs of
6 prosecution in its entirety. However, if the court determines that
7 a reduction in the fine, costs and costs of prosecution is
8 warranted, the court shall equally apply the same percentage
9 reduction to the fine, costs and costs of prosecution owed by the
10 offender the same manner as the court waives financial obligations
11 pursuant to Section 983 of this title. Any unpaid costs of
12 prosecution shall be waived if the deferred sentence of an offender
13 expires without being accelerated. Any fees collected by the
14 district attorney pursuant to this paragraph shall be deposited in

1 of a lcohol, other intoxicating substance, or a combination of
2 alcohol and another intoxicating substance, or who is before the
3 court for the offense of operating a motor vehicle while the ability
4 of the person to operate such vehicle was impaired due to the
5 consumption of alcohol, require the person to participate in an
6 alcohol and drug substance abuse evaluation program offered by a
7 facility or qualified practitioner certified by the Department of
8 Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services for the purpose of
9 evaluating the receptivity to treatment and prognosis of the person.
10 The court shall order the person to reimburse the facility or
11 qualified practitioner for the evaluation. The Department of Mental
12 Health and Substance Abuse Services shall establish a fee schedule,
13 based upon the ability of a person to pay, provided the fee for an
14 evaluation shall not exceed Seventy-five Dollars ($75.00). The
15 evaluation shall be conducted at a certified facility, the office of
16 a qualified practitioner or at another location as ordered by the
17 court. The facility or qualified practitioner shall, within
18 seventy-two (72) hours from the time the person is assessed, submit
19 a written report to the court for the purpose of assisting the court
20 in its determination of conditions for deferred sentence. No
21 person, agency or facility operating an alcohol and drug substance
22 abuse evaluation program certified by the Department of Mental
23 Health and Substance Abuse Services shall solicit or refer any
24 person evaluated pursuant to this subsection for any treatment
ENGR. S. A. TO ENGR. H. B. NO. 1460 Page 43
1 prog ram or alcohol and drug substance abuse service in which the
2 person, agency or facility has a vested interest; however, this
3 provision shall not be construed to prohibit the court from ordering
4 participation in or any person from voluntarily utilizing a
5 treatment program or alcohol and drug substance abuse service
6 offered by such person, agency or facility. Any evaluation report
7 submitted to the court pursuant to this subsection shall be handled
8 in a manner which will keep the report confidential from review by
9 the general public. Nothing contained in this subsection shall be
10 construed to prohibit the court from ordering judgment and sentence
11 in the event the defendant fails or refuses to comply with an order
12 of the court to obtain the evaluation required by this subsection.
13 As used in this subsection, “qualified practitioner” means a person
14 with at least a bachelor’s degree in substance abuse treatment,
15 mental health or a related health care field and at least two (2)
16 years of experience in providing alcohol abuse treatment, other drug
17 abuse treatment, or both alcohol and other drug abuse treatment who
18 is certified each year by the Department of Mental Health and
19 Substance Abuse Services to provide these assessments. However, any
20 person who does not meet the requirements for a qualified
21 practitioner as defined herein, but who has been previously
22 certified by the Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse
23 Services to provide alcohol or drug treatment or assessments, shall
24 be considered a qualified practitioner provided all education,
ENGR. S. A. TO ENGR. H. B. NO. 1460 Page 44

5 Sections 3-452 and 3-453 of Title 43A of the Oklahoma Statutes; and
6 2. A victims impact panel program, as defined in subsection H
7 of Section 991a of this title, if such a program is offered in the
8 county where the judgment is rendered. The defendant shall be
9 required to pay a fee of Seventy-five Dollars ($75.00) as set by the
10 governing authority of the program and approved by the court to the
11 victims impact panel program to offset the cost of participation by
12 the defendant, if in the opinion of the court the defendant has the
13 ability to pay such fee.
14 D. Upon completion of the conditions of the deferred judgment,
15 and upon a finding by the court that the conditions have been met
16 and all fines, fees, and monetary assessments have been paid as
17 ordered, the defendant shall be discharged without a court judgment
18 of guilt, and the court shall order the verdict or plea of guilty or
19 plea of nolo contendere to be expunged from the record and the
20 charge shall be dismissed with prejudice to any further action. The
21 procedure to expunge the record of the defendant shall be as
22 follows:

6 4. No information concerning the confidential file shall be
7 revealed or released, except upon written order of a judge of the
8 district court or upon written request by the named defendant to the
9 court clerk for the purpose of updating the criminal history record
10 of the defendant with the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation;
11 and
12 5. Defendants qualifying under Section 18 of this title may
13 petition the court to have the filing of the indictment and the
14 dismissal expunged from the public index and docket sheet. This
15 section shall not be mutually exclusive of Section 18 of this title.
16 Records expunged pursuant to this subsection shall be sealed to
17 the public but not to law enforcement agencies for law enforcement
18 purposes. Records expunged pursuant to this subsection shall be
19 admissible in any subsequent criminal prosecution to prove the
20 existence of a prior conviction or prior deferred judgment without
21 the necessity of a court order requesting the unsealing of such
22 records.
23 E. The provisions of subsection D of this section shall be
24 retroactive.
ENGR. S. A. TO ENGR. H. B. NO. 1460 Page 46

4 forth the grounds for such acceleration is filed by the district
5 attorney with the clerk of the sentencing court and competent
6 evidence justifying the acceleration of the judgment is presented to
7 the court at a hearing to be held for that purpose. The hearing
8 shall be held not more than twenty (20) days after the entry of the
9 plea of not guilty to the petition, unless waived by both the state
10 and the defendant. Any acceleration of a deferred sentence based on
11 a technical violation shall not exceed ninety (90) days for a first
12 acceleration or five (5) years for a second or subsequent
13 acceleration.
14 G. Upon any violation of the deferred judgment, other than a
15 technical violation, the court may enter a judgment of guilt and
16 proceed as provided in Section 991a of this title or may modify any
17 condition imposed. Provided, however, if the deferred judgment is
18 for a felony offense, and the defendant commits another felony
19 offense, the defendant shall not be allowed bail pending appeal.
20 H. The deferred judgment procedure described in this section
21 shall apply only to defendants who have not been previously
22 convicted of a felony offense and have not received more than one

24 previous to the commission of the pending offense.
ENGR. S. A. TO ENGR. H. B. NO. 1460 Page 47

2 application of the district attorney. Both the application and the
3 waiver shall be made a part of the record of the case.

14 subsequently been lowered to a misdemeanor shall only be subject to
15 a judgment and sentence that would have been applicable had he or
16 she committed the offense after July 1, 2017.

14 another person on behalf of the defendant posts a bond, other than
15 by personal recognizance, the court may consider such fact in
16 determining the eligibility of the defendant for appointment of the
17 System; provided, however, such consideration shall not be the sole
18 factor in the determination of eligibility.
19 E. The System shall be prohibited from accepting an appointment

18 immediately upon release from incarceration or if parole is granted
19 and shall not be limited to two (2) years. Provided further, any
20 supervision provided for in this section may be extended for a

21 SECTION 3. AMENDATORY 22 O.S. 2021, Section 991c, is
22 amended to read as follows:
23 Section 991c. A. Upon a verdict or plea of guilty or upon a
24 plea of nolo contendere, but before a judgment of guilt, the court
ENGR. S. A. TO ENGR. H. B. NO. 1460 Page 39

1 may, without entering a judgment of guilt and with the consent of
2 the defendant, defer further proceedings upon the specific
3 conditions prescribed by the court not to exceed a seven-year
4 period, except as authorized under subsection B of this section.
5 The court shall first consider restitution among the various
6 conditions it may prescribe. The court may also consider ordering
7 the defendant to:
8 1. Pay court costs;
9 2. Pay an assessment in lieu of any fine authorized by law for
10 the offense;
11 3. Pay any other assessment or cost authorized by law;
12 4. Engage in a term of community service without compensation,
13 according to a schedule consistent with the employment and family
14 responsibilities of the defendant;
15 5. County jail confinement for a period not to exceed ninety
16 (90) days or the maximum amount of jail time provided for the
17 offense, if it is less than ninety (90) days;
18 6. Pay an amount as reimbursement for reasonable attorney fees,
19 to be paid into the court fund, if a court-appointed attorney has
20 been provided to the defendant;
21 7. Be supervised in the community for a period not to exceed
22 eighteen (18) months, unless a petition alleging violation of any
23 condition of deferred judgment is filed during the period of
24 supervision. As a condition of any supervision, the defendant shall
ENGR. S. A. TO ENGR. H. B. NO. 1460 Page 40

1 be r equired to pay a supervision fee of Forty Dollars ($40.00) per
2 month. The supervision fee shall be waived in whole or part by the
3 supervisory agency when the accused is indigent. Any fees collected
4 by the district attorney pursuant to this paragraph shall be
5 deposited in the General Revenue Fund of the State Treasury. No
6 person shall be denied supervision based solely on the inability of
7 the person to pay a fee;
8 8. Pay into the court fund a monthly amount not exceeding Forty
9 Dollars ($40.00) per month during any period during which the
10 proceedings are deferred when the defendant is not to be supervised
11 in the community. The total amount to be paid into the court fund
12 shall be established by the court and shall not exceed the amount of
13 the maximum fine authorized by law for the offense;
14 9. Make other reparations to the community or victim as
15 required and deemed appropriate by the court;
16 10. Order any conditions which can be imposed for a suspended
17 sentence pursuant to paragraph 1 of subsection A of Section 991a of
18 this title; or
19 11. Any combination of the above provisions in paragraphs 1
20 through 10 of this subsection.
21 However, unless under the supervision of the district attorney,
22 the offender shall be required to pay Forty Dollars ($40.00) per
23 month to the district attorney during the first two (2) years of
24 probation to compensate the district attorney for the costs incurred
ENGR. S. A. TO ENGR. H. B. NO. 1460 Page 41

1 duri ng the prosecution of the offender and for the additional work
2 of verifying the compliance of the offender with the rules and
3 conditions of his or her probation. The district attorney may waive
4 any part of this requirement in the best interests of justice. The
5 court shall not may waive, suspend, defer or dismiss the costs of
6 prosecution in its entirety. However, if the court determines that
7 a reduction in the fine, costs and costs of prosecution is
8 warranted, the court shall equally apply the same percentage
9 reduction to the fine, costs and costs of prosecution owed by the
10 offender the same manner as the court waives financial obligations
11 pursuant to Section 983 of this title. Any unpaid costs of
12 prosecution shall be waived if the deferred sentence of an offender
13 expires without being accelerated. Any fees collected by the
14 district attorney pursuant to this paragraph shall be deposited in
15 the General Revenue Fund of the State Treasury.
16 B. When the court has ordered restitution as a condition of
17 supervision as provided for in subsection A of this section and that
18 condition has not been satisfied, the court may, at any time prior
19 to the termination or expiration of the supervision period, order an
20 extension of supervision for a period not to exceed three (3) years.
21 C. In addition to any conditions of supervision provided for in
22 subsection A of this section, the court shall, in the case of a
23 person before the court for the offense of operating or being in
24 control of a motor vehicle while the person was under the influence
ENGR. S. A. TO ENGR. H. B. NO. 1460 Page 42

1 of a lcohol, other intoxicating substance, or a combination of
2 alcohol and another intoxicating substance, or who is before the
3 court for the offense of operating a motor vehicle while the ability
4 of the person to operate such vehicle was impaired due to the
5 consumption of alcohol, require the person to participate in an
6 alcohol and drug substance abuse evaluation program offered by a
7 facility or qualified practitioner certified by the Department of
8 Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services for the purpose of
9 evaluating the receptivity to treatment and prognosis of the person.
10 The court shall order the person to reimburse the facility or
11 qualified practitioner for the evaluation. The Department of Mental
12 Health and Substance Abuse Services shall establish a fee schedule,
13 based upon the ability of a person to pay, provided the fee for an
14 evaluation shall not exceed Seventy-five Dollars ($75.00). The
15 evaluation shall be conducted at a certified facility, the office of
16 a qualified practitioner or at another location as ordered by the
17 court. The facility or qualified practitioner shall, within
18 seventy-two (72) hours from the time the person is assessed, submit
19 a written report to the court for the purpose of assisting the court
20 in its determination of conditions for deferred sentence. No
21 person, agency or facility operating an alcohol and drug substance
22 abuse evaluation program certified by the Department of Mental
23 Health and Substance Abuse Services shall solicit or refer any
24 person evaluated pursuant to this subsection for any treatment
ENGR. S. A. TO ENGR. H. B. NO. 1460 Page 43

1 prog ram or alcohol and drug substance abuse service in which the
2 person, agency or facility has a vested interest; however, this
3 provision shall not be construed to prohibit the court from ordering
4 participation in or any person from voluntarily utilizing a
5 treatment program or alcohol and drug substance abuse service
6 offered by such person, agency or facility. Any evaluation report
7 submitted to the court pursuant to this subsection shall be handled
8 in a manner which will keep the report confidential from review by
9 the general public. Nothing contained in this subsection shall be
10 construed to prohibit the court from ordering judgment and sentence
11 in the event the defendant fails or refuses to comply with an order
12 of the court to obtain the evaluation required by this subsection.
13 As used in this subsection, “qualified practitioner” means a person
14 with at least a bachelor’s degree in substance abuse treatment,
15 mental health or a related health care field and at least two (2)
16 years of experience in providing alcohol abuse treatment, other drug
17 abuse treatment, or both alcohol and other drug abuse treatment who
18 is certified each year by the Department of Mental Health and
19 Substance Abuse Services to provide these assessments. However, any
20 person who does not meet the requirements for a qualified
21 practitioner as defined herein, but who has been previously
22 certified by the Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse
23 Services to provide alcohol or drug treatment or assessments, shall
24 be considered a qualified practitioner provided all education,
ENGR. S. A. TO ENGR. H. B. NO. 1460 Page 44

1 expe rience and certification requirements stated herein are met by
2 September 1, 1995. The court may also require the person to
3 participate in one or both of the following:
4 1. An alcohol and drug substance abuse course, pursuant to
5 Sections 3-452 and 3-453 of Title 43A of the Oklahoma Statutes; and
6 2. A victims impact panel program, as defined in subsection H
7 of Section 991a of this title, if such a program is offered in the
8 county where the judgment is rendered. The defendant shall be
9 required to pay a fee of Seventy-five Dollars ($75.00) as set by the
10 governing authority of the program and approved by the court to the
11 victims impact panel program to offset the cost of participation by
12 the defendant, if in the opinion of the court the defendant has the
13 ability to pay such fee.
14 D. Upon completion of the conditions of the deferred judgment,
15 and upon a finding by the court that the conditions have been met
16 and all fines, fees, and monetary assessments have been paid as
17 ordered, the defendant shall be discharged without a court judgment
18 of guilt, and the court shall order the verdict or plea of guilty or
19 plea of nolo contendere to be expunged from the record and the
20 charge shall be dismissed with prejudice to any further action. The
21 procedure to expunge the record of the defendant shall be as
22 follows:
23 1. All references to the name of the defendant shall be deleted
24 from the docket sheet;
ENGR. S. A. TO ENGR. H. B. NO. 1460 Page 45

5 have been obliterated pursuant to the provisions of this section;
6 4. No information concerning the confidential file shall be
7 revealed or released, except upon written order of a judge of the
8 district court or upon written request by the named defendant to the
9 court clerk for the purpose of updating the criminal history record
10 of the defendant with the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation;
11 and
12 5. Defendants qualifying under Section 18 of this title may
13 petition the court to have the filing of the indictment and the
14 dismissal expunged from the public index and docket sheet. This
15 section shall not be mutually exclusive of Section 18 of this title.
16 Records expunged pursuant to this subsection shall be sealed to
17 the public but not to law enforcement agencies for law enforcement
18 purposes. Records expunged pursuant to this subsection shall be
19 admissible in any subsequent criminal prosecution to prove the
20 existence of a prior conviction or prior deferred judgment without
21 the necessity of a court order requesting the unsealing of such
22 records.
23 E. The provisions of subsection D of this section shall be
24 retroactive.
ENGR. S. A. TO ENGR. H. B. NO. 1460 Page 46

2 to the provisions of this section, deferred judgment may not be
3 accelerated for any technical violation unless a petition setting
4 forth the grounds for such acceleration is filed by the district
5 attorney with the clerk of the sentencing court and competent
6 evidence justifying the acceleration of the judgment is presented to
7 the court at a hearing to be held for that purpose. The hearing
8 shall be held not more than twenty (20) days after the entry of the
9 plea of not guilty to the petition, unless waived by both the state
10 and the defendant. Any acceleration of a deferred sentence based on
11 a technical violation shall not exceed ninety (90) days for a first
12 acceleration or five (5) years for a second or subsequent
13 acceleration.
14 G. Upon any violation of the deferred judgment, other than a
15 technical violation, the court may enter a judgment of guilt and
16 proceed as provided in Section 991a of this title or may modify any
17 condition imposed. Provided, however, if the deferred judgment is
18 for a felony offense, and the defendant commits another felony
19 offense, the defendant shall not be allowed bail pending appeal.
20 H. The deferred judgment procedure described in this section
21 shall apply only to defendants who have not been previously
22 convicted of a felony offense and have not received more than one
23 deferred judgment for a felony offense within the ten (10) years
24 previous to the commission of the pending offense.
ENGR. S. A. TO ENGR. H. B. NO. 1460 Page 47

1 Provided, the court may waive this prohibition upon written
2 application of the district attorney. Both the application and the
3 waiver shall be made a part of the record of the case.
4 I. The deferred judgment procedure described in this section
5 shall not apply to defendants found guilty or who plead guilty or
6 nolo contendere to a sex offense required by law to register

13 of a deferred judgment for an offense where the penalty has
14 subsequently been lowered to a misdemeanor shall only be subject to
15 a judgment and sentence that would have been applicable had he or
16 she committed the offense after July 1, 2017.

7 the application is submitted, and no application shall be accepted
8 without payment of the fee; except that the court may, based upon
9 the financial information submitted, defer all or part of the fee if

11 resources to pay the fee at time of application, to attach as a
12 court fee upon conviction. Any fees collected pursuant to this

9 whichever is appropriate, for review. Upon request by any party
10 including, but not limited to, the attorney appointed to represent
11 the indigent, the court shall hold a hearing on the issue of
12 eligibility for appointment of the System.
13 D. If the defendant is admitted to bail and the defendant or
14 another person on behalf of the defendant posts a bond, other than
15 by personal recognizance, the court may consider such fact in
16 determining the eligibility of the defendant for appointment of the
17 System; provided, however, such consideration shall not be the sole
18 factor in the determination of eligibility.
19 E. The System shall be prohibited from accepting an appointment
20 unless a completed application for court-appointed counsel as
