SENATE FLOOR VERSION - HB1460 SFLR Page 42
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)
1 Ment al Health and Substance Abuse Services for the purpose of

3 The court shall order the person to reimburse the facility or
4 qualified practitioner for the evaluation. The Department of Mental
5 Health and Substance Abuse Services shall establish a fee schedule,
6 based upon the ability of a person to pay, provided the fee for an
7 evaluation shall not exceed Seventy-five Dollars ($75.00). The
8 evaluation shall be conducted at a certified facility, the office of

10 court. The facility or qualified practitioner shall, within
11 seventy-two (72) hours from the time the person is assessed, submit

13 in its determination of conditions for deferred sentence. No

16 Health and Substance Abuse Services shall solicit or refer any
17 person evaluated pursuant to this subsection for any treatment
18 program or alcohol and drug substance abuse service in which the
19 person, agency or facility has a vested interest; however, this
20 provision shall not be construed to prohibit the court from ordering
21 participation in or any person from voluntarily utilizing a
22 treatment program or alcohol and drug substance abuse service
23 offered by such person, agency or facility. Any evaluation report
24 submitted to the court pursuant to this subsection shall be handled
SENATE FLOOR VERSION - HB1460 SFLR Page 43

2 the general public. Nothing contained in this subsection shall be

5 of the court to obtain the evaluation required by this subsection.
6 As used in this subsection, “qualified practitioner” means a person
7 with at least a bachelor’s degree in substance abuse treatment,

9 years of experience in providing alcohol abuse treatment, other drug
10 abuse treatment, or both alcohol and other drug abuse treatment who
11 is certified each year by the Department of Mental Health and
12 Substance Abuse Services to provide these assessments. However, any
13 person who does not meet the requirements for a qualified
14 practitioner as defined herein, but who has been previously
15 certified by the Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse
16 Services to provide alcohol or drug treatment or assessments, shall
17 be considered a qualified practitioner provided all education,
18 experience and certification requirements stated herein are met by
19 September 1, 1995. The court may also require the person to
20 participate in one or both of the following:
21 1. An alcohol and drug substance abuse course, pursuant to
22 Sections 3-452 and 3-453 of Title 43A of the Oklahoma Statutes; and

3 governing authority of the program and approved by the court to the
4 victims impact panel program to offset the cost of participation by
5 the defendant, if in the opinion of the court the defendant has the
6 ability to pay such fee.
7 D. Upon completion of the conditions of the deferred judgment,
8 and upon a finding by the court that the conditions have been met
9 and all fines, fees, and monetary assessments have been paid as
10 ordered, the defendant shall be discharged without a court judgment
11 of guilt, and the court shall order the verdict or plea of guilty or
12 plea of nolo contendere to be expunged from the record and the
13 charge shall be dismissed with prejudice to any further action. The
14 procedure to expunge the record of the defendant shall be as
15 follows:
16 1. All references to the name of the defendant shall be deleted
17 from the docket sheet;
18 2. The public index of the filing of the charge shall be
19 expunged by deletion, mark-out or obliteration;

8 section shall not be mutually exclusive of Section 18 of this title.
9 Records expunged pursuant to this subsection shall be sealed to
10 the public but not to law enforcement agencies for law enforcement
11 purposes. Records expunged pursuant to this subsection shall be
12 admissible in any subsequent criminal prosecution to prove the
13 existence of a prior conviction or prior deferred judgment without
14 the necessity of a court order requesting the unsealing of such
15 records.
16 E. The provisions of subsection D of this section shall be
17 retroactive.
18 F. Whenever a judgment has been deferred by the court according
19 to the provisions of this section, deferred judgment may not be
20 accelerated for any technical violation unless a petition setting
21 forth the grounds for such acceleration is filed by the district
22 attorney with the clerk of the sentencing court and competent
23 evidence justifying the acceleration of the judgment is presented to
24 the court at a hearing to be held for that purpose. The hearing

5 acceleration or five (5) years for a second or subsequent
6 acceleration.
7 G. Upon any violation of the deferred judgment, other than a
8 technical violation, the court may enter a judgment of guilt and
9 proceed as provided in Section 991a of this title or may modify any
10 condition imposed. Provided, however, if the deferred judgment is
11 for a felony offense, and the defendant commits another felony
12 offense, the defendant shall not be allowed bail pending appeal.
13 H. The deferred judgment procedure described in this section
14 shall apply only to defendants who have not been previously
15 convicted of a felony offense and have not received more than one
16 deferred judgment for a felony offense within the ten (10) years
17 previous to the commission of the pending offense.
18 Provided, the court may waive this prohibition upon written
19 application of the district attorney. Both the application and the
20 waiver shall be made a part of the record of the case.
21 I. The deferred judgment procedure described in this section

SENATE FLOOR VERSION - HB1460 SFLR Page 40
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)

1 8. Pay into the court fund a monthly amount not exceeding Forty

15 abuse evaluation program certified by the Department of Mental
16 Health and Substance Abuse Services shall solicit or refer any
17 person evaluated pursuant to this subsection for any treatment
18 program or alcohol and drug substance abuse service in which the
19 person, agency or facility has a vested interest; however, this
20 provision shall not be construed to prohibit the court from ordering
21 participation in or any person from voluntarily utilizing a
22 treatment program or alcohol and drug substance abuse service
23 offered by such person, agency or facility. Any evaluation report
24 submitted to the court pursuant to this subsection shall be handled
SENATE FLOOR VERSION - HB1460 SFLR Page 43

13 person who does not meet the requirements for a qualified
14 practitioner as defined herein, but who has been previously
15 certified by the Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse
16 Services to provide alcohol or drug treatment or assessments, shall
17 be considered a qualified practitioner provided all education,
18 experience and certification requirements stated herein are met by

5 the defendant, if in the opinion of the court the defendant has the
6 ability to pay such fee.
7 D. Upon completion of the conditions of the deferred judgment,
8 and upon a finding by the court that the conditions have been met
9 and all fines, fees, and monetary assessments have been paid as
10 ordered, the defendant shall be discharged without a court judgment
11 of guilt, and the court shall order the verdict or plea of guilty or
12 plea of nolo contendere to be expunged from the record and the

13 existence of a prior conviction or prior deferred judgment without
14 the necessity of a court order requesting the unsealing of such
15 records.
16 E. The provisions of subsection D of this section shall be
17 retroactive.
18 F. Whenever a judgment has been deferred by the court according
19 to the provisions of this section, deferred judgment may not be

5 acceleration or five (5) years for a second or subsequent
6 acceleration.
7 G. Upon any violation of the deferred judgment, other than a
8 technical violation, the court may enter a judgment of guilt and
9 proceed as provided in Section 991a of this title or may modify any

12 offense, the defendant shall not be allowed bail pending appeal.
13 H. The deferred judgment procedure described in this section
14 shall apply only to defendants who have not been previously
