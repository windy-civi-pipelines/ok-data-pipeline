10 of verifying the compliance of the offender with the rules and
11 conditions of his or her probation. The district attorney may waive
12 any part of this requirement in the best interests of justice. The
13 court shall not waive, suspend, defer or dismiss the costs of
14 prosecution in its entirety. However, if the court determines that
15 a reduction in the fine, costs and costs of prosecution is

10 of the person to operate such vehicle was impaired due to the
11 consumption of alcohol, require the person to participate in an
12 alcohol and drug substance abuse evaluation program offered by a
13 facility or qualified practitioner certified by the Department of
14 Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services for the purpose of
15 evaluating the receptivity to treatment and prognosis of the person.
16 The court shall order the person to reimburse the facility or
17 qualified practitioner for the evaluation. The Department of Mental
18 Health and Substance Abuse Services shall establish a fee schedule,
19 based upon the ability of a person to pay, provided the fee for an

21 evaluation shall be conducted at a certified facility, the office of

23 court. The facility or qualified practitioner shall, within

6 person evaluated pursuant to this subsection for any treatment
7 program or alcohol and drug substance abuse service in which the
8 person, agency or facility has a vested interest; however, this
9 provision shall not be construed to prohibit the court from ordering
10 participation in or any person from voluntarily utilizing a
11 treatment program or alcohol and drug substance abuse service
12 offered by such person, agency or facility. Any evaluation report
13 submitted to the court pursuant to this subsection shall be handled
14 in a manner which will keep the report confidential from review by
15 the general public. Nothing contained in this subsection shall be
16 construed to prohibit the court from ordering judgment and sentence
17 in the event the defendant fails or refuses to comply with an order
18 of the court to obtain the evaluation required by this subsection.
19 As used in this subsection, "qualified practitioner" means a person
20 with at least a bachelor's degree in substance abuse treatment,

15 required to pay a fee of Seventy-five Dollars ($75.00) as set by the
16 governing authority of the program and approved by the court to the
17 victims impact panel program to offset the cost of participation by
18 the defendant, if in the opinion of the court the defendant has the
19 ability to pay such fee.
20 D. Upon completion of the conditions of the deferred judgment,
21 and upon a finding by the court that the conditions have been met
22 and all fines, fees, and monetary assessments have been paid as
23 ordered, the defendant shall be discharged without a court judgment
24 of guilt, and the court shall order the verdict or plea of guilty or

14 district court or upon written request by the named defendant to the
15 court clerk for the purpose of updating the criminal history record
16 of the defendant with the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation;
17 and
18 5. Defendants qualifying under Section 18 of this title may
19 petition the court to have the filing of the indictment and the
20 dismissal expunged from the public index and docket sheet. This
21 section shall not be mutually exclusive of Section 18 of this title.

6 retroactive.
7 F. Whenever a judgment has been deferred by the court according

10 forth the grounds for such acceleration is filed by the district
11 attorney with the clerk of the sentencing court and competent
12 evidence justifying the acceleration of the judgment is presented to
13 the court at a hearing to be held for that purpose. The hearing
14 shall be held not more than twenty (20) days after the entry of the
15 plea of not guilty to the petition, unless waived by both the state
16 and the defendant. Any acceleration of a deferred sentence based on
17 a technical violation shall not exceed ninety (90) days for a first
18 acceleration or five (5) years for a second or subsequent
19 acceleration.
20 G. Upon any violation of the deferred judgment, other than a
21 technical violation, the court may enter a judgment of guilt and
22 proceed as provided in Section 991a of this title or may modify any
23 condition imposed. Provided, however, if the deferred judgment is
