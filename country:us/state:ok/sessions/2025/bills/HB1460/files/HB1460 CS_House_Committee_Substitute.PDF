11 be required to pay a supervision fee of Forty Dollars ($40.00) per
12 month. The supervision fee shall be waived in whole or part by the
13 supervisory agency when the accused is indigent. Any fees collected
14 by the district attorney pursuant to this paragraph shall be
15 deposited in the General Revenue Fund of the State Treasury. No
16 person shall be denied supervision based solely on the inability of
17 the person to pay a fee;
18 8. Pay into the court fund a monthly amount not exceeding Forty
19 Dollars ($40.00) per month during any period during which the

3 person who does not meet the requirements for a qualified
4 practitioner as defined herein, but who has been previously

6 Services to provide alcohol or drug treatment or assessments, shall
7 be considered a qualified practitioner provided all education,

13 2. A victims impact panel program, as defined in subsection H
14 of Section 991a of this title, if such a program is offered in the

17 governing authority of the program and approved by the court to the
18 victims impact panel program to offset the cost of participation by

20 ability to pay such fee.

22 and upon a finding by the court that the conditions have been met
23 and all fines, fees, and monetary assessments have been paid as

Req. No. 13237 Page 43

12 have been obliterated pursuant to the provisions of this section;
13 4. No information concerning the confidential file shall be
14 revealed or released, except upon written order of a judge of the
15 district court or upon written request by the named defendant to the
16 court clerk for the purpose of updating the criminal history record
17 of the defendant with the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation;
18 and
19 5. Defendants qualifying under Section 18 of this title may
20 petition the court to have the filing of the indictment and the
21 dismissal expunged from the public index and docket sheet. This
22 section shall not be mutually exclusive of Section 18 of this title.

7 retroactive.
8 F. Whenever a judgment has been deferred by the court according

11 forth the grounds for such acceleration is filed by the district
12 attorney with the clerk of the sentencing court and competent
13 evidence justifying the acceleration of the judgment is presented to
14 the court at a hearing to be held for that purpose. The hearing
15 shall be held not more than twenty (20) days after the entry of the
16 plea of not guilty to the petition, unless waived by both the state
17 and the defendant. Any acceleration of a deferred sentence based on
18 a technical violation shall not exceed ninety (90) days for a first
19 acceleration or five (5) years for a second or subsequent
20 acceleration.
21 G. Upon any violation of the deferred judgment, other than a
22 technical violation, the court may enter a judgment of guilt and
23 proceed as provided in Section 991a of this title or may modify any
24 condition imposed. Provided, however, if the deferred judgment is
Req. No. 13237 Page 45
1 for a felony offense, and the defendant commits another felony
2 offense, the defendant shall not be allowed bail pending appeal.
3 H. The deferred judgment procedure described in this section
4 shall apply only to defendants who have not been previously
5 convicted of a felony offense and have not received more than one
6 deferred judgment for a felony offense within the ten (10) years
7 previous to the commission of the pending offense.

9 application of the district attorney. Both the application and the
10 waiver shall be made a part of the record of the case.

12 shall not apply to defendants found guilty or who plead guilty or
13 nolo contendere to a sex offense required by law to register

20 of a deferred judgment for an offense where the penalty has
21 subsequently been lowered to a misdemeanor shall only be subject to
22 a judgment and sentence that would have been applicable had he or
23 she committed the offense after July 1, 2017.

11 be required to pay a supervision fee of Forty Dollars ($40.00) per
12 month. The supervision fee shall be waived in whole or part by the
13 supervisory agency when the accused is indigent. Any fees collected
14 by the district attorney pursuant to this paragraph shall be
15 deposited in the General Revenue Fund of the State Treasury. No
16 person shall be denied supervision based solely on the inability of
17 the person to pay a fee;
18 8. Pay into the court fund a monthly amount not exceeding Forty
19 Dollars ($40.00) per month during any period during which the

20 offender. Any fees collected by the district attorney pursuant to
21 this paragraph shall be deposited in the General Revenue Fund of the
22 State Treasury.

13 alcohol and drug substance abuse evaluation program offered by a
14 facility or qualified practitioner certified by the Department of
15 Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services for the purpose of
16 evaluating the receptivity to treatment and prognosis of the person.
17 The court shall order the person to reimburse the facility or
18 qualified practitioner for the evaluation. The Department of Mental
19 Health and Substance Abuse Services shall establish a fee schedule,
20 based upon the ability of a person to pay, provided the fee for an
21 evaluation shall not exceed Seventy-five Dollars ($75.00). The
22 evaluation shall be conducted at a certified facility, the office of

14 submitted to the court pursuant to this subsection shall be handled
15 in a manner which will keep the report confidential from review by
16 the general public. Nothing contained in this subsection shall be

19 of the court to obtain the evaluation required by this subsection.
20 As used in this subsection, "qualified practitioner" means a person
21 with at least a bachelor's degree in substance abuse treatment,

Req. No. 13237 Page 42

20 ability to pay such fee.

22 and upon a finding by the court that the conditions have been met
23 and all fines, fees, and monetary assessments have been paid as
24 ordered, the defendant shall be discharged without a court judgment
Req. No. 13237 Page 43

14 the court at a hearing to be held for that purpose. The hearing
15 shall be held not more than twenty (20) days after the entry of the

18 a technical violation shall not exceed ninety (90) days for a first
19 acceleration or five (5) years for a second or subsequent
20 acceleration.
21 G. Upon any violation of the deferred judgment, other than a
