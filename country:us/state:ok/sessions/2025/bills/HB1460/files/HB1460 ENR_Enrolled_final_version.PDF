However, unless under the supervision of the district attorney,
the offender shall be required to pay Forty Dollars ($40.00) per
month to the district attorney during the first two (2) years of
probation to compensate the district attorney for the costs incurred

conditions of his or her probation. The district attorney may waive
any part of this requirement in the best interests of justice. The
court shall not may waive, suspend, defer or dismiss the costs of

Section 42:
sections shall be ordered to participate in, prior to sentencing, an

If a person is sentenced to the custody of the Department of
Corrections and the court has received a written evaluation report
pursuant to this subsection, the report shall be furnished to the
Department of Corrections with the judgment and sentence. Any
evaluation report submitted to the court pursuant to this subsection
shall be handled in a manner which will keep such report
confidential from the general public’s review. Nothing contained in
this subsection shall be construed to prohibit the court from
ordering judgment and sentence in the event the defendant fails or
refuses to comply with an order of the court to obtain the
evaluation required by this subsection.
C. When sentencing a person convicted of a crime, the court
shall first consider a program of restitution for the victim, as
well as imposition of a fine or incarceration of the offender. The
provisions of paragraph 1 of subsection A of this section shall not
apply to defendants being sentenced upon their third or subsequent
to their third conviction of a felony. Provided, the court may
waive these prohibitions upon written application of the district
attorney. Both the application and the waiver shall be made part of
the record of the case.
D. When sentencing a person convicted of a crime, the judge
shall consider any victim impact statements if submitted to the
jury, or the judge in the event a jury is waived.
E. Probation, for purposes of subsection A of this section, is
a procedure by which a defendant found guilty of a crime, whether
upon a verdict or plea of guilty or upon a plea of nolo contendere,
is released by the court subject to conditions imposed by the court
and subject to supervision by the Department of Corrections, a
private supervision provider or other person designated by the
court. Such supervision shall be initiated upon an order of
probation from the court, and shall not exceed two (2) years, unless
a petition alleging a violation of any condition of deferred
judgment or seeking revocation of the suspended sentence is filed
during the supervision, or as otherwise provided by law. In the
case of a person convicted of a sex offense, supervision shall begin

supervision provided for in this section may be extended for a
period not to exceed the expiration of the maximum term or terms of
the sentence upon a determination by the court or the Division of
Probation and Parole of the Department of Corrections that the best
interests of the public and the release will be served by an
extended period of supervision.
F. The Department of Corrections, or such other agency as the
court may designate, shall be responsible for the monitoring and
administration of the restitution and service programs provided for
by subparagraphs a, c and d of paragraph 1 of subsection A of this

Section 44:
section, and shall ensure that restitution payments are forwarded to
the victim and that service assignments are properly performed.
G. 1. The Department of Corrections is hereby authorized,
subject to funds available through appropriation by the Legislature,
to contract with counties for the administration of county Community
Service Sentencing Programs.

Program; provided, participation in county-funded Programs shall not
be limited to offenders who would otherwise be sentenced to
confinement with the Department of Corrections.

Section 46:
3. The Department shall establish criteria and specifications
for contracts with counties for such Programs. A county may apply
to the Department for a contract for a county-funded Program for a
specific period of time. The Department shall be responsible for
ensuring that any contracting county complies in full with
specifications and requirements of the contract. The contract shall
set appropriate compensation to the county for services to the
Department.

Section 47:
4. The Department is hereby authorized to provide technical
assistance to any county in establishing a Program, regardless of
whether the county enters into a contract pursuant to this
subsection. Technical assistance shall include appropriate
staffing, development of community resources, sponsorship,
supervision and any other requirements.

previously submitted to DNA testing under this section and for whom
a valid sample is on file in the OSBI Combined DNA Index System
(CODIS) Database at the time of sentencing shall not be required to
submit to additional testing. Except as required by the Sex
Offenders Registration Act, a deferred judgment does not require
submission to DNA testing.
Any person who is incarcerated in the custody of the Department
of Corrections after July 1, 1996, and who has not been released
before January 1, 2006, shall provide a blood or saliva sample prior
to release. Every person subject to DNA testing after January 1,

Section 52:
SECTION 3. AMENDATORY 22 O.S. 2021, Section 991c, is
amended to read as follows:

Section 53:
Section 991c. A. Upon a verdict or plea of guilty or upon a
plea of nolo contendere, but before a judgment of guilt, the court
may, without entering a judgment of guilt and with the consent of
the defendant, defer further proceedings upon the specific
conditions prescribed by the court not to exceed a seven-year
period, except as authorized under subsection B of this section.
The court shall first consider restitution among the various
conditions it may prescribe. The court may also consider ordering
the defendant to:

Section 54:
1. Pay court costs;

the offense;

Section 56:
3. Pay any other assessment or cost authorized by law;

ENR. H. B. NO. 1460 Page 25

Section 59:
6. Pay an amount as reimbursement for reasonable attorney fees,
to be paid into the court fund, if a court-appointed attorney has
been provided to the defendant;

Section 60:
7. Be supervised in the community for a period not to exceed
eighteen (18) months, unless a petition alleging violation of any
condition of deferred judgment is filed during the period of
supervision. As a condition of any supervision, the defendant shall
be required to pay a supervision fee of Forty Dollars ($40.00) per
month. The supervision fee shall be waived in whole or part by the
supervisory agency when the accused is indigent. Any fees collected
by the district attorney pursuant to this paragraph shall be
deposited in the General Revenue Fund of the State Treasury. No
person shall be denied supervision based solely on the inability of
the person to pay a fee;

Section 61:
8. Pay into the court fund a monthly amount not exceeding Forty
Dollars ($40.00) per month during any period during which the
proceedings are deferred when the defendant is not to be supervised
in the community. The total amount to be paid into the court fund
shall be established by the court and shall not exceed the amount of
the maximum fine authorized by law for the offense;

Section 62:
9. Make other reparations to the community or victim as
required and deemed appropriate by the court;

Section 63:
10. Order any conditions which can be imposed for a suspended
sentence pursuant to paragraph 1 of subsection A of Section 991a of
this title; or

Section 64:
11. Any combination of the above provisions in paragraphs 1
through 10 of this subsection.
However, unless under the supervision of the district attorney,
the offender shall be required to pay Forty Dollars ($40.00) per
month to the district attorney during the first two (2) years of
probation to compensate the district attorney for the costs incurred
during the prosecution of the offender and for the additional work
of verifying the compliance of the offender with the rules and
conditions of his or her probation. The district attorney may waive
any part of this requirement in the best interests of justice. The
court shall not may waive, suspend, defer or dismiss the costs of
prosecution in its entirety. However, if the court determines that
a reduction in the fine, costs and costs of prosecution is
warranted, the court shall equally apply the same percentage
ENR. H. B. NO. 1460 Page 26
reduction to the fine, costs and costs of prosecution owed by the
offender the same manner as the court waives financial obligations
pursuant to Section 983 of this title. Any unpaid costs of
prosecution shall be waived if the deferred sentence of an offender
expires without being accelerated. Any fees collected by the
district attorney pursuant to this paragraph shall be deposited in
the General Revenue Fund of the State Treasury.
B. When the court has ordered restitution as a condition of
supervision as provided for in subsection A of this section and that
condition has not been satisfied, the court may, at any time prior
to the termination or expiration of the supervision period, order an
extension of supervision for a period not to exceed three (3) years.
C. In addition to any conditions of supervision provided for in
subsection A of this section, the court shall, in the case of a
person before the court for the offense of operating or being in
control of a motor vehicle while the person was under the influence
of alcohol, other intoxicating substance, or a combination of
alcohol and another intoxicating substance, or who is before the
court for the offense of operating a motor vehicle while the ability
of the person to operate such vehicle was impaired due to the
consumption of alcohol, require the person to participate in an
alcohol and drug substance abuse evaluation program offered by a
facility or qualified practitioner certified by the Department of
Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services for the purpose of
evaluating the receptivity to treatment and prognosis of the person.
The court shall order the person to reimburse the facility or
qualified practitioner for the evaluation. The Department of Mental
Health and Substance Abuse Services shall establish a fee schedule,
based upon the ability of a person to pay, provided the fee for an
evaluation shall not exceed Seventy-five Dollars ($75.00). The
evaluation shall be conducted at a certified facility, the office of
a qualified practitioner or at another location as ordered by the
court. The facility or qualified practitioner shall, within
seventy-two (72) hours from the time the person is assessed, submit
a written report to the court for the purpose of assisting the court
in its determination of conditions for deferred sentence. No
person, agency or facility operating an alcohol and drug substance
abuse evaluation program certified by the Department of Mental
Health and Substance Abuse Services shall solicit or refer any
person evaluated pursuant to this subsection for any treatment
program or alcohol and drug substance abuse service in which the
person, agency or facility has a vested interest; however, this
provision shall not be construed to prohibit the court from ordering
ENR. H. B. NO. 1460 Page 27
participation in or any person from voluntarily utilizing a
treatment program or alcohol and drug substance abuse service
offered by such person, agency or facility. Any evaluation report
submitted to the court pursuant to this subsection shall be handled
in a manner which will keep the report confidential from review by
the general public. Nothing contained in this subsection shall be
construed to prohibit the court from ordering judgment and sentence
in the event the defendant fails or refuses to comply with an order
of the court to obtain the evaluation required by this subsection.
As used in this subsection, “qualified practitioner” means a person
with at least a bachelor’s degree in substance abuse treatment,
mental health or a related health care field and at least two (2)
years of experience in providing alcohol abuse treatment, other drug
abuse treatment, or both alcohol and other drug abuse treatment who
is certified each year by the Department of Mental Health and
Substance Abuse Services to provide these assessments. However, any
person who does not meet the requirements for a qualified
practitioner as defined herein, but who has been previously
certified by the Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse
Services to provide alcohol or drug treatment or assessments, shall
be considered a qualified practitioner provided all education,
experience and certification requirements stated herein are met by
September 1, 1995. The court may also require the person to
participate in one or both of the following:

Section 65:
1. An alcohol and drug substance abuse course, pursuant to

Section 66:
Sections 3-452 and 3-453 of Title 43A of the Oklahoma Statutes; and

Section 67:
2. A victims impact panel program, as defined in subsection H
of Section 991a of this title, if such a program is offered in the
county where the judgment is rendered. The defendant shall be
required to pay a fee of Seventy-five Dollars ($75.00) as set by the
governing authority of the program and approved by the court to the
victims impact panel program to offset the cost of participation by
the defendant, if in the opinion of the court the defendant has the
ability to pay such fee.
D. Upon completion of the conditions of the deferred judgment,
and upon a finding by the court that the conditions have been met
and all fines, fees, and monetary assessments have been paid as
ordered, the defendant shall be discharged without a court judgment
of guilt, and the court shall order the verdict or plea of guilty or
plea of nolo contendere to be expunged from the record and the
charge shall be dismissed with prejudice to any further action. The
ENR. H. B. NO. 1460 Page 28
procedure to expunge the record of the defendant shall be as
follows:

Section 68:
1. All references to the name of the defendant shall be deleted
from the docket sheet;

Section 69:
2. The public index of the filing of the charge shall be
expunged by deletion, mark-out or obliteration;

Section 70:
3. Upon expungement, the court clerk shall keep a separate
confidential index of case numbers and names of defendants which
have been obliterated pursuant to the provisions of this section;

Section 71:
4. No information concerning the confidential file shall be
revealed or released, except upon written order of a judge of the
district court or upon written request by the named defendant to the
court clerk for the purpose of updating the criminal history record
of the defendant with the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation;
and

Section 72:
5. Defendants qualifying under Section 18 of this title may
petition the court to have the filing of the indictment and the
dismissal expunged from the public index and docket sheet. This

Section 73:
section shall not be mutually exclusive of Section 18 of this title.
Records expunged pursuant to this subsection shall be sealed to
the public but not to law enforcement agencies for law enforcement
purposes. Records expunged pursuant to this subsection shall be
admissible in any subsequent criminal prosecution to prove the
existence of a prior conviction or prior deferred judgment without
the necessity of a court order requesting the unsealing of such
records.
E. The provisions of subsection D of this section shall be
retroactive.
F. Whenever a judgment has been deferred by the court according
to the provisions of this section, deferred judgment may not be
accelerated for any technical violation unless a petition setting
forth the grounds for such acceleration is filed by the district
attorney with the clerk of the sentencing court and competent
evidence justifying the acceleration of the judgment is presented to
the court at a hearing to be held for that purpose. The hearing
shall be held not more than twenty (20) days after the entry of the
plea of not guilty to the petition, unless waived by both the state
ENR. H. B. NO. 1460 Page 29
and the defendant. Any acceleration of a deferred sentence based on
a technical violation shall not exceed ninety (90) days for a first
acceleration or five (5) years for a second or subsequent
acceleration.
G. Upon any violation of the deferred judgment, other than a
technical violation, the court may enter a judgment of guilt and
proceed as provided in Section 991a of this title or may modify any
condition imposed. Provided, however, if the deferred judgment is
for a felony offense, and the defendant commits another felony
offense, the defendant shall not be allowed bail pending appeal.
H. The deferred judgment procedure described in this section
shall apply only to defendants who have not been previously
convicted of a felony offense and have not received more than one
deferred judgment for a felony offense within the ten (10) years
previous to the commission of the pending offense.
Provided, the court may waive this prohibition upon written
application of the district attorney. Both the application and the
waiver shall be made a part of the record of the case.
I. The deferred judgment procedure described in this section
shall not apply to defendants found guilty or who plead guilty or
nolo contendere to a sex offense required by law to register
pursuant to the Sex Offenders Registration Act.
J. All defendants who are supervised pursuant to this section
shall be subject to the sanction process as established in
subsection D of Section 991b of this title.
K. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections F and G of
this section, a person who is being considered for an acceleration
of a deferred judgment for an offense where the penalty has
subsequently been lowered to a misdemeanor shall only be subject to
a judgment and sentence that would have been applicable had he or
she committed the offense after July 1, 2017.

cc.
bb. to attend a victim-offender reconciliation program if

Corrections. The treatment program shall include
polygraph examinations specifically designed for use
with sex offenders for purposes of supervision and
treatment compliance, and shall be administered not
less than each six (6) months during the period of
supervision. The examination shall be administered by
a certified licensed polygraph examiner. The
treatment program must be approved by the Department
of Corrections or the Department of Mental Health and
Substance Abuse Services. Such treatment shall be at
the expense of the defendant based on the defendant’s

ENR. H. B. NO. 1460 Page 13

ff.
ee. in addition to other sentencing powers of the court,
the court in the case of a defendant being sentenced
for a felony conviction for a violation of Section 2-
402 of Title 63 of the Oklahoma Statutes which
involves marijuana may require the person to
participate in a drug court program, if available. If
a drug court program is not available, the defendant

However, any such order for restitution, community service,
payment to a local certified crime stoppers program, payment to the
Oklahoma Reward System or confinement in the county jail, or a
ENR. H. B. NO. 1460 Page 14

combination thereof, shall be made in conjunction with probation and
shall be made a condition of the suspended sentence.
However, unless under the supervision of the district attorney,
the offender shall be required to pay Forty Dollars ($40.00) per
month to the district attorney during the first two (2) years of
probation to compensate the district attorney for the costs incurred
during the prosecution of the offender and for the additional work
of verifying the compliance of the offender with the rules and
conditions of his or her probation. The district attorney may waive
any part of this requirement in the best interests of justice. The
court shall not may waive, suspend, defer or dismiss the costs of
prosecution in its entirety. However, if the court determines that
a reduction in the fine, costs and costs of prosecution is
warranted, the court shall equally apply the same percentage

offender the same manner as the court waives financial obligations
pursuant to Section 983 of this title. Any unpaid costs of
prosecution shall be waived if the suspended sentence of an offender
expires without being revoked;
2. Impose a fine prescribed by law for the offense, with or

defendant’s case may be determined with reasonable certainty;
5. Order the defendant to reimburse the Oklahoma State Bureau
of Investigation for all costs incurred by that agency for cleaning
up an illegal drug laboratory site for which the defendant pleaded

license at the time of reinstatement of the license.
The restriction shall remain on the driver license for
such period as the court shall determine. The
restriction may be modified or removed by order of the
court and notice of the order shall be given to
Service Oklahoma. Upon the expiration of the period
for the restriction, Service Oklahoma shall remove the
restriction without further court order. Failure to
comply with the order to install an ignition interlock
device or operating any vehicle without such device
during the period of restriction shall be a violation
of the sentence and may be punished as deemed proper
by the sentencing court, or
e. beginning January 1, 1993, to submit to electronically
monitored home detention administered and supervised
by the Department of Corrections, and to pay to the
Department a monitoring fee, not to exceed Seventy-
five Dollars ($75.00) a month, to the Department of
Corrections, if in the opinion of the court the
defendant has the ability to pay such fee. Any fees
collected pursuant to this subparagraph shall be
deposited in the Department of Corrections Revolving
Fund. Any order by the court for the payment of the
monitoring fee, if willfully disobeyed, may be
enforced as an indirect contempt of court;

ENR. H. B. NO. 1460 Page 17

10. 9. In addition to the other sentencing powers of the court,
the court, in the case of a sex offender sentenced after November 1,
1989, and required by law to register pursuant to the Sex Offenders
Registration Act, shall require the defendant to participate in a
treatment program designed specifically for the treatment of sex
offenders, if available. The treatment program will include
polygraph examinations specifically designed for use with sex
offenders for the purpose of supervision and treatment compliance,
provided the examination is administered by a certified licensed
polygraph examiner. The treatment program must be approved by the
Department of Corrections or the Department of Mental Health and
Substance Abuse Services. Such treatment shall be at the expense of
the defendant based on the ability of the defendant to pay;
11. 10. In addition to the other sentencing powers of the
court, the court, in the case of a person convicted of abuse or
neglect of a child, as defined in Section 1-1-105 of Title 10A of
the Oklahoma Statutes, may require the person to undergo treatment
or to participate in counseling services. The defendant may be
required to pay all or part of the cost of the treatment or
counseling services;
12. 11. In addition to the other sentencing powers of the
court, the court, in the case of a person convicted of cruelty to

facilities for medical care and any boarding costs of victimized
animals;
13. 12. In addition to the other sentencing powers of the
court, a sex offender who is habitual or aggravated as defined by
Section 584 of Title 57 of the Oklahoma Statutes and who is required
to register as a sex offender pursuant to the Sex Offenders
Registration Act shall be supervised by the Department of
Corrections for the duration of the registration period and shall be
assigned to a global position monitoring device by the Department of
Corrections for the duration of the registration period. The cost
of such monitoring device shall be reimbursed by the offender;
14. 13. In addition to the other sentencing powers of the
court, in the case of a sex offender who is required by law to
register pursuant to the Sex Offenders Registration Act, the court
may prohibit the person from accessing or using any Internet social
networking website that has the potential or likelihood of allowing
ENR. H. B. NO. 1460 Page 18

the sex offender to have contact with any child who is under the age
of eighteen (18) years;
15. 14. In addition to the other sentencing powers of the
court, in the case of a sex offender who is required by law to
register pursuant to the Sex Offenders Registration Act, the court
shall require the person to register any electronic mail address
information, instant message, chat or other Internet communication
name or identity information that the person uses or intends to use
while accessing the Internet or used for other purposes of social

court, and pursuant to the terms and conditions of a written plea
agreement, the court may prohibit the defendant from entering,
visiting or residing within the judicial district in which the
defendant was convicted until after completion of his or her
sentence; provided, however, the court shall ensure that the
defendant has access to those services or programs for which the
defendant is required to participate as a condition of probation.
When seeking to enter the prohibited judicial district for personal
business not related to his or her criminal case, the defendant
shall be required to obtain approval by the court.
B. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any person who
is found guilty of a violation of any provision of Section 761 or
11-902 of Title 47 of the Oklahoma Statutes or any person pleading
guilty or nolo contendere for a violation of any provision of such
sections shall be ordered to participate in, prior to sentencing, an
alcohol and drug assessment and evaluation by an assessment agency
or assessment personnel certified by the Department of Mental Health
and Substance Abuse Services for the purpose of evaluating the
receptivity to treatment and prognosis of the person. The court
shall order the person to reimburse the agency or assessor for the
evaluation. The fee shall be the amount provided in subsection C of
Section 3-460 of Title 43A of the Oklahoma Statutes. The evaluation
shall be conducted at a certified assessment agency, the office of a
certified assessor or at another location as ordered by the court.
The agency or assessor shall, within seventy-two (72) hours from the
time the person is assessed, submit a written report to the court
for the purpose of assisting the court in its final sentencing
determination. No person, agency or facility operating an alcohol
and drug substance abuse evaluation program certified by the
Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services shall
solicit or refer any person evaluated pursuant to this subsection
ENR. H. B. NO. 1460 Page 19

for any treatment program or alcohol and drug substance abuse
service in which such person, agency or facility has a vested
interest; however, this provision shall not be construed to prohibit
the court from ordering participation in or any person from
voluntarily utilizing a treatment program or alcohol and drug
substance abuse service offered by such person, agency or facility.
If a person is sentenced to the custody of the Department of
Corrections and the court has received a written evaluation report
pursuant to this subsection, the report shall be furnished to the
Department of Corrections with the judgment and sentence. Any
evaluation report submitted to the court pursuant to this subsection
shall be handled in a manner which will keep such report
confidential from the general public’s review. Nothing contained in
this subsection shall be construed to prohibit the court from
ordering judgment and sentence in the event the defendant fails or
refuses to comply with an order of the court to obtain the
evaluation required by this subsection.
C. When sentencing a person convicted of a crime, the court
shall first consider a program of restitution for the victim, as
well as imposition of a fine or incarceration of the offender. The
provisions of paragraph 1 of subsection A of this section shall not
apply to defendants being sentenced upon their third or subsequent
to their third conviction of a felony. Provided, the court may
waive these prohibitions upon written application of the district
attorney. Both the application and the waiver shall be made part of
the record of the case.
D. When sentencing a person convicted of a crime, the judge
shall consider any victim impact statements if submitted to the
jury, or the judge in the event a jury is waived.
E. Probation, for purposes of subsection A of this section, is
a procedure by which a defendant found guilty of a crime, whether
upon a verdict or plea of guilty or upon a plea of nolo contendere,
is released by the court subject to conditions imposed by the court
and subject to supervision by the Department of Corrections, a
private supervision provider or other person designated by the
court. Such supervision shall be initiated upon an order of
probation from the court, and shall not exceed two (2) years, unless
a petition alleging a violation of any condition of deferred
judgment or seeking revocation of the suspended sentence is filed
during the supervision, or as otherwise provided by law. In the
case of a person convicted of a sex offense, supervision shall begin
immediately upon release from incarceration or if parole is granted
ENR. H. B. NO. 1460 Page 20

and shall not be limited to two (2) years. Provided further, any
supervision provided for in this section may be extended for a
period not to exceed the expiration of the maximum term or terms of
the sentence upon a determination by the court or the Division of
Probation and Parole of the Department of Corrections that the best
interests of the public and the release will be served by an
extended period of supervision.
F. The Department of Corrections, or such other agency as the
court may designate, shall be responsible for the monitoring and
administration of the restitution and service programs provided for
by subparagraphs a, c and d of paragraph 1 of subsection A of this
section, and shall ensure that restitution payments are forwarded to
the victim and that service assignments are properly performed.
G. 1. The Department of Corrections is hereby authorized,
subject to funds available through appropriation by the Legislature,
to contract with counties for the administration of county Community
Service Sentencing Programs.
2. Any offender eligible to participate in the Program pursuant
to this section shall be eligible to participate in a county
Program; provided, participation in county-funded Programs shall not
be limited to offenders who would otherwise be sentenced to
confinement with the Department of Corrections.
3. The Department shall establish criteria and specifications
for contracts with counties for such Programs. A county may apply
to the Department for a contract for a county-funded Program for a
specific period of time. The Department shall be responsible for
ensuring that any contracting county complies in full with
specifications and requirements of the contract. The contract shall
set appropriate compensation to the county for services to the
Department.
4. The Department is hereby authorized to provide technical
assistance to any county in establishing a Program, regardless of
whether the county enters into a contract pursuant to this
subsection. Technical assistance shall include appropriate
staffing, development of community resources, sponsorship,
supervision and any other requirements.
5. The Department shall annually make a report to the Governor,
the President Pro Tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House
on the number of such Programs, the number of participating
ENR. H. B. NO. 1460 Page 21

offenders, the success rates of each Program according to criteria
established by the Department and the costs of each Program.
H. As used in this section:
1. “Ignition interlock device” means a device that, without

program shall be attended by persons who have committed the offense
of driving, operating or being in actual physical control of a motor
vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or other intoxicating
substance, operating a motor vehicle while the ability of the person
to operate such vehicle was impaired due to the consumption of
alcohol or any other substance or operating a motor vehicle while
using an electronic device or by persons who have been convicted of
furnishing alcoholic beverage to persons under twenty-one (21) years
of age, as provided in Sections 6-101 and 6-120 of Title 37A of the

DNA testing for law enforcement identification purposes in
accordance with Section 150.27 of Title 74 of the Oklahoma Statutes
and the rules promulgated by the Oklahoma State Bureau of
Investigation for the OSBI Combined DNA Index System (CODIS)
Database. Any defendant sentenced to probation shall be required to
submit to testing within thirty (30) days of sentencing either to
the Department of Corrections or to the county sheriff or other
peace officer as directed by the court. Defendants who are
sentenced to a term of incarceration shall submit to testing in
accordance with Section 530.1 of Title 57 of the Oklahoma Statutes,
for those defendants who enter the custody of the Department of
Corrections or to the county sheriff, for those defendants sentenced
to incarceration in a county jail. Convicted individuals who have
previously submitted to DNA testing under this section and for whom
a valid sample is on file in the OSBI Combined DNA Index System
(CODIS) Database at the time of sentencing shall not be required to
submit to additional testing. Except as required by the Sex
Offenders Registration Act, a deferred judgment does not require
submission to DNA testing.
Any person who is incarcerated in the custody of the Department
of Corrections after July 1, 1996, and who has not been released
before January 1, 2006, shall provide a blood or saliva sample prior
to release. Every person subject to DNA testing after January 1,
2006, whose sentence does not include a term of confinement with the
Department of Corrections shall submit a blood or saliva sample.
Every person subject to DNA testing who is sentenced to unsupervised
probation or otherwise not supervised by the Department of
Corrections shall submit for blood or saliva testing to the sheriff
of the sentencing county.
J. Samples of blood or saliva for DNA testing required by
subsection I of this section shall be taken by employees or
contractors of the Department of Corrections, peace officers, or the
county sheriff or employees or contractors of the sheriff’s office.
The individuals shall be properly trained to collect blood or saliva
samples. Persons collecting blood or saliva for DNA testing
pursuant to this section shall be immune from civil liabilities
arising from this activity. All collectors of DNA samples shall
ensure the collection of samples are mailed to the Oklahoma State

comes into physical custody to serve a term of incarceration. All
collectors of DNA samples shall use sample kits provided by the OSBI
ENR. H. B. NO. 1460 Page 24

and procedures promulgated by the OSBI. Persons subject to DNA
testing who are not received at the Lexington Assessment and
Reception Center shall be required to pay a fee of Fifteen Dollars
($15.00) to the agency collecting the sample for submission to the
OSBI Combined DNA Index System (CODIS) Database. Any fees collected
pursuant to this subsection shall be deposited in the revolving
account or the service fee account of the collection agency or
department.
K. When sentencing a person who has been convicted of a crime
that would subject that person to the provisions of the Sex
Offenders Registration Act, neither the court nor the district
attorney shall be allowed to waive or exempt such person from the
registration requirements of the Sex Offenders Registration Act.
SECTION 3. AMENDATORY 22 O.S. 2021, Section 991c, is
amended to read as follows:
Section 991c. A. Upon a verdict or plea of guilty or upon a
plea of nolo contendere, but before a judgment of guilt, the court
may, without entering a judgment of guilt and with the consent of
the defendant, defer further proceedings upon the specific
conditions prescribed by the court not to exceed a seven-year
period, except as authorized under subsection B of this section.
The court shall first consider restitution among the various
conditions it may prescribe. The court may also consider ordering
the defendant to:
1. Pay court costs;
2. Pay an assessment in lieu of any fine authorized by law for
the offense;
3. Pay any other assessment or cost authorized by law;
4. Engage in a term of community service without compensation,
according to a schedule consistent with the employment and family
responsibilities of the defendant;
5. County jail confinement for a period not to exceed ninety
(90) days or the maximum amount of jail time provided for the
offense, if it is less than ninety (90) days;
ENR. H. B. NO. 1460 Page 25

6. Pay an amount as reimbursement for reasonable attorney fees,
to be paid into the court fund, if a court-appointed attorney has
been provided to the defendant;
7. Be supervised in the community for a period not to exceed
eighteen (18) months, unless a petition alleging violation of any
condition of deferred judgment is filed during the period of
supervision. As a condition of any supervision, the defendant shall
be required to pay a supervision fee of Forty Dollars ($40.00) per
month. The supervision fee shall be waived in whole or part by the
supervisory agency when the accused is indigent. Any fees collected
by the district attorney pursuant to this paragraph shall be
deposited in the General Revenue Fund of the State Treasury. No
person shall be denied supervision based solely on the inability of
the person to pay a fee;
8. Pay into the court fund a monthly amount not exceeding Forty
Dollars ($40.00) per month during any period during which the
proceedings are deferred when the defendant is not to be supervised
in the community. The total amount to be paid into the court fund
shall be established by the court and shall not exceed the amount of
the maximum fine authorized by law for the offense;
9. Make other reparations to the community or victim as
required and deemed appropriate by the court;
10. Order any conditions which can be imposed for a suspended
sentence pursuant to paragraph 1 of subsection A of Section 991a of
this title; or
11. Any combination of the above provisions in paragraphs 1
through 10 of this subsection.
However, unless under the supervision of the district attorney,
the offender shall be required to pay Forty Dollars ($40.00) per
month to the district attorney during the first two (2) years of
probation to compensate the district attorney for the costs incurred
during the prosecution of the offender and for the additional work
of verifying the compliance of the offender with the rules and
conditions of his or her probation. The district attorney may waive
any part of this requirement in the best interests of justice. The
court shall not may waive, suspend, defer or dismiss the costs of
prosecution in its entirety. However, if the court determines that
a reduction in the fine, costs and costs of prosecution is
warranted, the court shall equally apply the same percentage
ENR. H. B. NO. 1460 Page 26

reduction to the fine, costs and costs of prosecution owed by the
offender the same manner as the court waives financial obligations
pursuant to Section 983 of this title. Any unpaid costs of
prosecution shall be waived if the deferred sentence of an offender
expires without being accelerated. Any fees collected by the
district attorney pursuant to this paragraph shall be deposited in
the General Revenue Fund of the State Treasury.
B. When the court has ordered restitution as a condition of
supervision as provided for in subsection A of this section and that
condition has not been satisfied, the court may, at any time prior
to the termination or expiration of the supervision period, order an
extension of supervision for a period not to exceed three (3) years.
C. In addition to any conditions of supervision provided for in
subsection A of this section, the court shall, in the case of a
person before the court for the offense of operating or being in
control of a motor vehicle while the person was under the influence
of alcohol, other intoxicating substance, or a combination of
alcohol and another intoxicating substance, or who is before the
court for the offense of operating a motor vehicle while the ability
of the person to operate such vehicle was impaired due to the
consumption of alcohol, require the person to participate in an
alcohol and drug substance abuse evaluation program offered by a
facility or qualified practitioner certified by the Department of
Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services for the purpose of
evaluating the receptivity to treatment and prognosis of the person.
The court shall order the person to reimburse the facility or
qualified practitioner for the evaluation. The Department of Mental
Health and Substance Abuse Services shall establish a fee schedule,
based upon the ability of a person to pay, provided the fee for an
evaluation shall not exceed Seventy-five Dollars ($75.00). The
evaluation shall be conducted at a certified facility, the office of
a qualified practitioner or at another location as ordered by the
court. The facility or qualified practitioner shall, within
seventy-two (72) hours from the time the person is assessed, submit
a written report to the court for the purpose of assisting the court
in its determination of conditions for deferred sentence. No
person, agency or facility operating an alcohol and drug substance
abuse evaluation program certified by the Department of Mental
Health and Substance Abuse Services shall solicit or refer any
person evaluated pursuant to this subsection for any treatment
program or alcohol and drug substance abuse service in which the
person, agency or facility has a vested interest; however, this
provision shall not be construed to prohibit the court from ordering
ENR. H. B. NO. 1460 Page 27

participation in or any person from voluntarily utilizing a
treatment program or alcohol and drug substance abuse service
offered by such person, agency or facility. Any evaluation report
submitted to the court pursuant to this subsection shall be handled
in a manner which will keep the report confidential from review by
the general public. Nothing contained in this subsection shall be
construed to prohibit the court from ordering judgment and sentence
in the event the defendant fails or refuses to comply with an order
of the court to obtain the evaluation required by this subsection.
As used in this subsection, “qualified practitioner” means a person
with at least a bachelor’s degree in substance abuse treatment,
mental health or a related health care field and at least two (2)
years of experience in providing alcohol abuse treatment, other drug
abuse treatment, or both alcohol and other drug abuse treatment who
is certified each year by the Department of Mental Health and
Substance Abuse Services to provide these assessments. However, any
person who does not meet the requirements for a qualified
practitioner as defined herein, but who has been previously
certified by the Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse
Services to provide alcohol or drug treatment or assessments, shall
be considered a qualified practitioner provided all education,
experience and certification requirements stated herein are met by
September 1, 1995. The court may also require the person to
participate in one or both of the following:
1. An alcohol and drug substance abuse course, pursuant to
Sections 3-452 and 3-453 of Title 43A of the Oklahoma Statutes; and
2. A victims impact panel program, as defined in subsection H
of Section 991a of this title, if such a program is offered in the
county where the judgment is rendered. The defendant shall be
required to pay a fee of Seventy-five Dollars ($75.00) as set by the
governing authority of the program and approved by the court to the
victims impact panel program to offset the cost of participation by
the defendant, if in the opinion of the court the defendant has the
ability to pay such fee.
D. Upon completion of the conditions of the deferred judgment,
and upon a finding by the court that the conditions have been met
and all fines, fees, and monetary assessments have been paid as
ordered, the defendant shall be discharged without a court judgment
of guilt, and the court shall order the verdict or plea of guilty or
plea of nolo contendere to be expunged from the record and the
charge shall be dismissed with prejudice to any further action. The
ENR. H. B. NO. 1460 Page 28

procedure to expunge the record of the defendant shall be as
follows:
1. All references to the name of the defendant shall be deleted
from the docket sheet;
2. The public index of the filing of the charge shall be
expunged by deletion, mark-out or obliteration;
3. Upon expungement, the court clerk shall keep a separate
confidential index of case numbers and names of defendants which
have been obliterated pursuant to the provisions of this section;
4. No information concerning the confidential file shall be
revealed or released, except upon written order of a judge of the
district court or upon written request by the named defendant to the
court clerk for the purpose of updating the criminal history record
of the defendant with the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation;
and
5. Defendants qualifying under Section 18 of this title may
petition the court to have the filing of the indictment and the
dismissal expunged from the public index and docket sheet. This
section shall not be mutually exclusive of Section 18 of this title.
Records expunged pursuant to this subsection shall be sealed to
the public but not to law enforcement agencies for law enforcement
purposes. Records expunged pursuant to this subsection shall be
admissible in any subsequent criminal prosecution to prove the
existence of a prior conviction or prior deferred judgment without
the necessity of a court order requesting the unsealing of such
records.
E. The provisions of subsection D of this section shall be
retroactive.
F. Whenever a judgment has been deferred by the court according
to the provisions of this section, deferred judgment may not be
accelerated for any technical violation unless a petition setting
forth the grounds for such acceleration is filed by the district
attorney with the clerk of the sentencing court and competent
evidence justifying the acceleration of the judgment is presented to
the court at a hearing to be held for that purpose. The hearing
shall be held not more than twenty (20) days after the entry of the
plea of not guilty to the petition, unless waived by both the state
ENR. H. B. NO. 1460 Page 29

and the defendant. Any acceleration of a deferred sentence based on
a technical violation shall not exceed ninety (90) days for a first
acceleration or five (5) years for a second or subsequent
acceleration.
G. Upon any violation of the deferred judgment, other than a
technical violation, the court may enter a judgment of guilt and
proceed as provided in Section 991a of this title or may modify any
condition imposed. Provided, however, if the deferred judgment is
for a felony offense, and the defendant commits another felony
offense, the defendant shall not be allowed bail pending appeal.
H. The deferred judgment procedure described in this section
shall apply only to defendants who have not been previously
convicted of a felony offense and have not received more than one
deferred judgment for a felony offense within the ten (10) years
previous to the commission of the pending offense.
Provided, the court may waive this prohibition upon written
application of the district attorney. Both the application and the
waiver shall be made a part of the record of the case.
I. The deferred judgment procedure described in this section
shall not apply to defendants found guilty or who plead guilty or
nolo contendere to a sex offense required by law to register
pursuant to the Sex Offenders Registration Act.
J. All defendants who are supervised pursuant to this section
shall be subject to the sanction process as established in
subsection D of Section 991b of this title.
K. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections F and G of
this section, a person who is being considered for an acceleration
of a deferred judgment for an offense where the penalty has
subsequently been lowered to a misdemeanor shall only be subject to
a judgment and sentence that would have been applicable had he or
she committed the offense after July 1, 2017.
SECTION 4. AMENDATORY 22 O.S. 2021, Section 1355A, is
amended to read as follows:
Section 1355A. A. When an indigent requests representation by
the Oklahoma Indigent Defense System, such person shall submit an
appropriate application to the court clerk, which shall state that
the application is signed under oath and under the penalty of
ENR. H. B. NO. 1460 Page 30

perjury and that a false statement may be prosecuted as such. The
application shall state whether or not the indigent has been
released on bond. In addition, if the indigent has been released on
bond, the application shall include a written statement from the
applicant that the applicant has contacted three named attorneys,
licensed to practice law in this state, and the applicant has been
unable to obtain legal counsel. A nonrefundable application fee of
Forty Dollars ($40.00) shall be paid to the court clerk at the time
the application is submitted, and no application shall be accepted
without payment of the fee; except that the court may, based upon
the financial information submitted, defer all or part of the fee if
the court determines that the person does not have the financial
