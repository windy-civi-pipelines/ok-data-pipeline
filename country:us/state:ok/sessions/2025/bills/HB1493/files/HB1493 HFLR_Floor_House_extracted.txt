1 B. It is the intention of the Oklahoma State Legislature
2 through this act to focus on daily recess as essential for students
3 as it provides a necessary break from academic work, allowing
4 students to recharge both mentally and physically. Physical
5 activity during recess helps improve focus, reduce stress, and
6 support overall physical health. It also encourages social
7 interaction where children learn important skills like teamwork,
8 conflict resolution, and communication. By giving students adequate
9 time to play and unwind, recess fosters better behavior in the
10 classroom and enhances students' ability to concentrate and learn
11 effectively.
12 C. As used in this section:
13 1. "Daily recess" means a scheduled break or breaks during the
14 school day that will allow students to engage in unstructured free
15 play or physical activity;
16 2. "District board of education" means the governing board of
17 each school district in Oklahoma; and
18 3. "Physical activity" means any bodily movement that uses
19 energy and is produced by skeletal muscles.
20 D. School districts shall incorporate physical activity into
21 the school day by providing at least thirty (30) minutes for daily
22 recess to students in full-day prekindergarten, kindergarten, and
23 grades one through five. For grades six through eight, at least
24 thirty (30) minutes for daily recess is strongly recommended. Each

2 recess. The daily recess required by this subsection may be broken
3 up into segments that best fit the schedules of each school

7 requirements set forth in subsections B and C of Section 11-103.9 of
8 Title 70 of the Oklahoma Statutes.
