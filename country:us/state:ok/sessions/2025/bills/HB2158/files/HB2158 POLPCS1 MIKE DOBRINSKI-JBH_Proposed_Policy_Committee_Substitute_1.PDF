15 claims asserted against or damages incurred by the dealer to the
16 extent the claims or damages are caused by the access to and
17 unlawful disclosure of protected dealer data resulting from a breach
18 caused by the manufacturer or distributor or a third party to which
19 the manufacturer or distributor has provided the protected dealer
20 data in violation of this section, the written consent granted by
21 the dealer, or other applicable state or federal law.

24 compliant with commercially reasonable data security standards and
Req. No. 12234 Page 20

1 that the dealer has identified as one of its authorized integrators
2 from integrating into the dealer's dealer data system or place an
3 unreasonable restriction on integration by an authorized integrator
4 or other third party that the dealer wishes to be an authorized
5 integrator. For the purposes of this subsection, "unreasonable
6 restriction" includes:

16 sensitive, competitive, or other confidential business information
17 as a condition for accessing protected dealer data or sharing
18 protected dealer data with an authorized integrator.
19 Notwithstanding paragraph 1 of this subsection, a franchisor or
20 third party may charge a franchise or authorized integrator for
21 actual costs associated with modifications to a franchisor’s
22 electronic systems to enable a secure interface with the authorized
23 integrator’s system and software.

5 (3) does not consider the actual vehicle allocation
6 offered or otherwise made available to the dealer

Req. No. 12234 Page 29

1 with the dealer's delivery and preparation obligations

3 Commission which must be found by the Commission to be
4 reasonable, or has failed to adequately and fairly
5 compensate its dealers for labor, parts, and other
6 expenses incurred by the dealer to perform under and
7 comply with manufacturer's warranty agreements and
8 recall repairs which shall include diagnostic work as
9 applicable and assistance requested by a consumer
10 whose vehicle was subjected to an over-the-air or
11 remote change, repair, or update to any part, system,
12 accessory, or function by the manufacturer and
13 performed by the dealer in order to satisfy the
14 consumer. Time allowances for the diagnosis and
15 performance of repair work shall be reasonable and
16 adequate for the work to be performed. Adequate and
17 fair compensation, which under this provision shall be
18 no less than the rates customarily charged for retail
19 consumer repairs as calculated herein, for parts and
20 labor for warranty and recall repairs shall, at the
21 option of the new motor vehicle dealer, be established
22 by the new motor vehicle dealer submitting to the
23 manufacturer or distributor one hundred sequential
24 nonwarranty consumer-paid service repair orders which
Req. No. 12234 Page 30

1 contain warranty-like repairs, or ninety (90)
2 consecutive days of nonwarranty consumer-paid service
3 repair orders which contain warranty-like repairs,
4 whichever is less, covering repairs made no more than
5 one hundred eighty (180) days before the submission
6 and declaring the average percentage labor rate and/or
7 markup rate. A new motor vehicle dealer may not
8 submit a request to establish its retail rates more
9 than once in a twelve-month period. That request may
10 establish a parts markup rate, labor rate, or both.
11 The new motor vehicle dealer shall calculate its
12 retail parts rate by determining the total charges for
13 parts from the qualified repair orders submitted,
14 dividing that amount by the new motor vehicle dealer's
15 total cost of the purchase of those parts, subtracting
16 one (1), and multiplying by one hundred (100) to
17 produce a percentage. The new motor vehicle dealer
18 shall calculate its retail labor rate by dividing the
19 amount of the new motor vehicle dealer's total labor
20 sales from the qualified repair orders by the total
21 labor hours charged for those sales. When submitting
22 repair orders to establish a retail parts and labor
23 rate, a new motor vehicle dealer need not include
24 repairs for:
Req. No. 12234 Page 31

1 (1) routine maintenance including but not limited to
2 the replacement of bulbs, fluids, filters,
3 batteries, and belts that are not provided in the
4 course of and related to a repair,
5 (2) factory special events, specials, or promotional
6 discounts for retail consumer repairs,
7 (3) parts sold or repairs performed at wholesale,
8 (4) factory-approved goodwill or policy repairs or
9 replacements,
10 (5) repairs with aftermarket parts, when calculating
11 the retail parts rate but not the retail labor
12 rate,
13 (6) repairs on aftermarket parts,
14 (7) replacement of or work on tires including front-
15 end alignments and wheel or tire rotations,
16 (8) repairs of motor vehicles owned by the new motor
17 vehicle dealer or employee thereof at the time of
18 the repair,
19 (9) vehicle reconditioning, or
20 (10) items that do not have individual part numbers
21 including, but not limited to, nuts, bolts, and
22 fasteners.
23 A manufacturer or distributor may, not later than
24 forty-five (45) days after submission, rebut that
Req. No. 12234 Page 32

1 declared retail parts and labor rate in writing by
2 reasonably substantiating that the rate is not
3 accurate or is incomplete pursuant to the provisions
4 of this section. If the manufacturer or distributor
5 determines the set of repair orders submitted by the
6 new motor vehicle dealer pursuant to this section for
7 a retail labor rate or retail parts markup rate is
8 substantially higher than the new motor vehicle
9 dealer's current warranty rates, the manufacturer or
10 distributor may request, in writing, within forty-five
11 (45) days after the manufacturer's or distributor's
12 receipt of the new motor vehicle dealer's initial
13 submission, all repair orders closed within the period
14 of thirty (30) days immediately preceding, or thirty
15 (30) days immediately following, the set of repair
16 orders initially submitted by the new motor vehicle
17 dealer. All time periods under this section shall be
18 suspended until the supplemental repair orders are
19 provided. If the manufacturer or distributor requests
20 supplemental repair orders, the manufacturer or
21 distributor may, within thirty (30) days after
22 receiving the supplemental repair orders and in
23 accordance with the formula described in this
24 subsection, calculate a proposed adjusted retail labor
Req. No. 12234 Page 33

1 rate or retail parts markup rate, as applicable, based
2 upon any set of the qualified repair orders submitted
3 by the franchisee and following the formula set forth
4 herein to establish the rate. The retail labor and
5 parts rates shall go into effect thirty (30) days
6 following the approval by the manufacturer or
7 distributor. If the declared rate is rebutted, the
8 manufacturer or distributor shall provide written
9 notice stating the reasons for the rebuttal, an
10 explanation of the reasons for the rebuttal, and a
11 copy of all calculations used by the franchisor in
12 determining the manufacturer or distributor's position
13 and propose an adjustment in writing of the average
14 percentage markup or labor rate based on that rebuttal
15 not later than forty-five (45) days after submission.
16 If the new motor vehicle dealer does not agree with
17 the proposed average percentage markup or labor rate,
18 the new motor vehicle dealer may file a protest with
19 the Commission not later than thirty (30) days after
20 receipt of that proposal by the manufacturer or
21 distributor. In the event a protest is filed, the
22 manufacturer or distributor shall have the burden of
23 proof to establish the new motor vehicle dealer's
24 submitted parts markup rate or labor rate was
Req. No. 12234 Page 34

1 inaccurate or not complete pursuant to the provisions
2 of this section. A manufacturer or distributor may
3 not retaliate against any new motor vehicle dealer
4 seeking to exercise its rights under this section. A
5 manufacturer or distributor may require a dealer to
6 submit repair orders in accordance with this section
7 in order to validate the reasonableness of a dealer's
8 retail rate for parts or labor not more often than
9 once every twelve (12) months. A manufacturer or
10 distributor may not otherwise recover its costs from
11 new motor vehicle dealers within this state including
12 a surcharge imposed on a new motor vehicle dealer
13 solely intended to recover the cost of reimbursing a
14 new motor vehicle dealer for parts and labor pursuant
15 to this section; provided, a manufacturer or
16 distributor shall not be prohibited from increasing
17 prices for vehicles or parts in the normal course of
18 business or from auditing and charging back claims in
19 accordance with this section. All claims made by
20 dealers for compensation for delivery, preparation,
21 warranty, or recall repair work shall be paid within
22 thirty (30) days after approval and shall be approved
23 or disapproved within thirty (30) days after receipt.
24 When any claim is disapproved, the dealer shall be
Req. No. 12234 Page 35

1 notified in writing of the grounds for disapproval.
2 The dealer's delivery, preparation, and warranty
3 obligations as filed with the Commission shall
4 constitute the dealer's sole responsibility for
5 product liability as between the dealer and
6 manufacturer. A factory may reasonably and
7 periodically audit a new motor vehicle dealer to
8 determine the validity of paid claims for new motor
9 vehicle dealer compensation or any charge-backs for
10 warranty parts or service compensation. Except in
11 cases of suspected fraud, audits of warranty payments
12 shall only be for the one-year period immediately
13 following the date of the payment. A manufacturer
14 shall reserve the right to reasonable, periodic audits
15 to determine the validity of paid claims for dealer
16 compensation or any charge-backs for consumer or
17 dealer incentives. Except in cases of suspected
18 fraud, audits of incentive payments shall only be for
19 a one-year period immediately following the date of
20 the payment. A factory shall not deny a claim or
21 charge a new motor vehicle dealer back subsequent to
22 the payment of the claim unless the factory can show
23 that the claim was false or fraudulent or that the new
24 motor vehicle dealer failed to reasonably substantiate
Req. No. 12234 Page 36

1 the claim by the written reasonable procedures of the
2 factory. A factory shall not deny a claim or
3 implement a charge-back against a new motor vehicle
4 dealer after payment of a claim in the event a
5 purchaser of a new vehicle that is the subject of a
6 claim fails to comply with titling or registration
7 laws of this state and is not prevented from
8 compliance by any action of the new motor vehicle
9 dealer; provided, that the factory may require the new
10 motor vehicle dealer to provide, within thirty (30)
11 days of notice of charge-back, withholding of payment,
12 or denial of claim, the documentation to demonstrate
13 the vehicle sale, delivery, and customer qualification
14 for an incentive as reported, including consumer name
15 and address and written attestation signed by the
16 dealer operator or general manager stating the
17 consumer was not on the export control list and the
18 dealer did not know or have reason to know the vehicle
19 was being exported or resold.
20 The factory shall provide written notice to a dealer
21 of a proposed charge-back that is the result of an
22 audit along with the specific audit results and
23 proposed charge-back amount. A dealer that receives
24 notice of a proposed charge-back pursuant to a
Req. No. 12234 Page 37

1 factory's audit has the right to file a protest with
2 the Commission within thirty (30) days after receipt
3 of the notice of the charge-back or audit results,
4 whichever is later. The factory is prohibited from
5 implementing the charge-back or debiting the dealer's
6 account until either the time frame for filing a
7 protest has passed or a final adjudication is rendered
8 by the Commission, whichever is later, unless the
9 dealer has agreed to the charge-back or charge-backs,
10 c. fails to compensate the new motor vehicle dealer for a
11 used motor vehicle:
12 (1) that is of the same make and model manufactured,
13 imported, or distributed by the factory and is a
14 line-make that the new motor vehicle dealer is
15 franchised to sell or on which the new motor
16 vehicle dealer is authorized to perform recall
17 repairs,
18 (2) that is subject to a stop-sale or do-not-drive
19 order issued by the factory or an authorized
20 governmental agency,
21 (3) that is held by the new motor vehicle dealer in
22 the dealer's inventory at the time the stop-sale
23 or do-not-drive order is issued or that is taken
24 by the new motor vehicle dealer into the dealer's
Req. No. 12234 Page 38

1 inventory after the recall notice as a result of
2 a retail consumer trade-in or a lease return to
3 the dealer inventory in accordance with an
4 applicable lease contract,
5 (4) that cannot be repaired due to the
6 unavailability, within thirty (30) days after
7 issuance of the stop-sale or do-not-drive order,
8 of a remedy or parts necessary for the new motor
9 vehicle dealer to make the recall repair, and
10 (5) that is not at least in the prorated amount of
11 one percent (1.00%) of the value of the vehicle
12 per month beginning on the date that is thirty
13 (30) days after the date on which the stop-sale
14 order was provided to the new motor vehicle
15 dealer until the earlier of either of the
16 following:
17 (a) the date the recall remedy or parts are made
18 available, or
19 (b) the date the new motor vehicle dealer sells,
20 trades, or otherwise disposes of the
21 affected used motor vehicle.
22 For the purposes of division (5) of this subparagraph,
23 the value of a used vehicle shall be the average Black
24 Book value for the year, make, and model of the
Req. No. 12234 Page 39

1 recalled vehicle. A factory may direct the manner and
2 method in which a new motor vehicle dealer must
3 demonstrate the inventory status of an affected used
4 motor vehicle to determine eligibility under this
5 subparagraph; provided, that the manner and method may
6 not be unduly burdensome and may not require
7 information that is unduly burdensome to provide. All
8 reimbursement claims made by new motor vehicle dealers
9 pursuant to this section for recall remedies or
10 repairs, or for compensation where no part or repair
11 is reasonably available and the vehicle is subject to
12 a stop-sale or do-not-drive order, shall be subject to
13 the same limitations and requirements as a warranty
14 reimbursement claim made under subparagraph b of this
15 paragraph. In the alternative, a manufacturer may
16 compensate its franchised new motor vehicle dealers
17 under a national recall compensation program;
18 provided, the compensation under the program is equal
19 to or greater than that provided under division (5) of
20 this subparagraph, or as the manufacturer and new
21 motor vehicle dealer otherwise agree. Nothing in this
22 section shall require a factory to provide total
23 compensation to a new motor vehicle dealer which would
24 exceed the total average Black Book value of the
Req. No. 12234 Page 40

1 affected used motor vehicle as originally determined
2 under division (5) of this subparagraph. Any remedy
3 provided to a new motor vehicle dealer under this
4 subparagraph is exclusive and may not be combined with
5 any other state or federal compensation remedy,
6 d. unreasonably fails or refuses to offer to its same
7 line-make franchised dealers a reasonable supply and
8 mix of all models manufactured for that line-make, or
9 unreasonably requires a dealer to pay any extra fee,
10 purchase unreasonable advertising displays or other
11 materials, or enter into a separate agreement which
12 adversely alters the rights or obligations contained
13 within the new motor vehicle dealer's existing
14 franchise agreement or which waives any right of the
15 new motor vehicle dealer as protected by Section 561
16 et seq. of this title, or remodel, renovate, or
17 recondition the new motor vehicle dealer's existing
18 facilities as a prerequisite to receiving a model or
19 series of vehicles, except as may be necessary to sell
20 or service the model or series of vehicles as provided
21 by subparagraph e of this paragraph. It shall be a
22 violation of this section for new vehicle allocation
23 to be withheld subject to any requirement to purchase
24 or sell any number of used or off-lease vehicles. The
Req. No. 12234 Page 41

1 failure to deliver any such new motor vehicle shall
2 not be considered a violation of the section if the
3 failure is not arbitrary or is due to lack of
4 manufacturing capacity or to a strike or labor
5 difficulty, a shortage of materials, a freight
6 embargo, or other cause over which the manufacturer
7 has no control. However, this subparagraph shall not
8 apply to recreational vehicles, limited production
9 model vehicles, a vehicle not advertised by the
10 factory for sale in this state, vehicles that are
11 subject to allocation affected by federal
12 environmental laws or environmental laws of this
13 state, or vehicles allocated in response to an
14 unforeseen event or circumstance,
15 e. except as necessary to comply with a health or safety
16 law, or to comply with a technology requirement which
17 is necessary to sell or service a motor vehicle that
18 the franchised new motor vehicle dealer is authorized
19 or licensed by the franchisor to sell or service,
20 requires a new motor vehicle dealer to construct a new
21 facility or substantially renovate the new motor
22 vehicle dealer's existing facility unless the facility
23 construction or renovation is justified by the
24 economic conditions existing at the time, as well as
Req. No. 12234 Page 42

1 the reasonably foreseeable projections, in the new
2 motor vehicle dealer's market and in the automotive
3 industry. However, this subparagraph shall not apply
4 if the new motor vehicle dealer voluntarily agrees to
5 facility construction or renovation in exchange for
6 money, credit, allowance, reimbursement, or additional
7 vehicle allocation to a new motor vehicle dealer from
8 the factory to compensate the new motor vehicle dealer
9 for the cost of, or a portion of the cost of, the
10 facility construction or renovation. Except as
11 necessary to comply with a health or safety law, or to
12 comply with a technology or safety requirement which
13 is necessary to sell or service a motor vehicle that
14 the franchised new motor vehicle dealer is authorized
15 or licensed by the franchisor to sell or service, a
16 new motor vehicle dealer which completes a facility
17 construction or renovation pursuant to factory
18 requirements shall not be required to construct a new
19 facility or renovate the existing facility if the same
20 area of the facility or premises has been constructed
21 or substantially altered within the last ten (10)
22 years and the construction or alteration was approved
23 by the manufacturer as a part of a facility upgrade
24 program, standard, or policy. For purposes of this
Req. No. 12234 Page 43

1 subparagraph, "substantially altered" means to perform
2 an alteration that substantially impacts the
3 architectural features, characteristics, or integrity
4 of a structure or lot. The term shall not include
5 routine maintenance reasonably necessary to maintain a
6 dealership in attractive condition. If a facility
7 upgrade program, standard, or policy under which the
8 dealer completed a facility construction or
9 substantial alteration does not contain a specific
10 time period during which the manufacturer or
11 distributor shall provide payments or benefits to a
12 participating dealer, or the time frame specified
13 under the program is reduced or canceled prematurely
14 in the unilateral discretion of the manufacturer or
15 distributor, the manufacturer or distributor shall not
16 deny the participating dealer any payment or benefit
17 under the terms of the program, standard, or policy as
18 it existed when the dealer began to perform under the
19 program, standard, or policy for the balance of the
20 ten-year period, regardless of whether the
21 manufacturer's or distributor's program, standard, or
22 policy has been changed or canceled, unless the
23 manufacturer and dealer agree, in writing, to the
24 change in payment or benefit. During the ten-year
Req. No. 12234 Page 44

1 period following facility construction or substantial
2 alteration, the manufacturer shall not fail to make
3 available to the dealer a fair and proportionate share
4 of all new vehicles distributed to dealers of the same
5 line-make in this state, subject to the same
6 reasonable terms, including vehicles distributed from
7 a common new vehicle inventory pool outside of the
8 factory's ordinary allocation process, such as any
9 vehicles the factory reserves to distribute on a
10 discretionary basis,
11 f. requires a new motor vehicle dealer to establish an
12 exclusive facility or to change the location of the
13 dealership, unless supported by reasonable business,
14 market, and economic considerations; provided, that
15 this section shall not restrict the terms of any
16 agreement for such exclusive facility voluntarily
17 entered into and supported by valuable consideration
18 separate from the new motor vehicle dealer's right to
19 sell and service motor vehicles for the franchisor.
20 If a dealer is required by the manufacturer or
21 distributor to change an existing, previously approved
22 location of the dealership and has not sold its
23 existing dealership facility and real estate within
24 the later of one hundred eighty (180) days of listing
Req. No. 12234 Page 45

1 the property for sale or ninety (90) days after the
2 facility relocation, then, upon the written request of
3 the dealer, the manufacturer or distributor shall
4 purchase the dealer's existing dealership facility and
5 real estate as if the new motor vehicle dealership
6 continues to operate on the property. If the factory
7 and dealer cannot agree on the value of the dealership
8 facilities and real estate, then the factory and
9 dealer shall utilize the process described in
10 paragraph 6 of subsection G of Section 565.2 of this
11 title. If a manufacturer or distributor purchases a
12 dealership facility and real estate, then it shall be
13 entitled to sole ownership, possession, use, and
14 control of any items, buildings, or property that were
15 included in the contract to purchase,
16 g. requires a new motor vehicle dealer to enter into a
17 site-control agreement covering any or all of the new
18 motor vehicle dealer's facilities or premises;
19 provided, that this section shall not restrict the
20 terms of any site-control agreement voluntarily
21 entered into and supported by valuable consideration
22 separate from the new motor vehicle dealer's right to
23 sell and service motor vehicles for the franchisor.
24 Notwithstanding the foregoing or the terms of any
Req. No. 12234 Page 46

1 site-control agreement, a site-control agreement
2 automatically extinguishes if all of the factory's
3 franchises that operated from the location that are
4 the subject of the site-control agreement are
5 terminated by the factory as part of the
6 discontinuance of a product line,
7 h. refuses to pay, or claims reimbursement from, a new
8 motor vehicle dealer for sales, incentives, or other
9 payments related to a motor vehicle sold by the new
10 motor vehicle dealer because the purchaser of the
11 motor vehicle exported or resold the motor vehicle in
12 violation of the policy of the factory unless the
13 factory can show that, at the time of the sale, the
14 new motor vehicle dealer knew or reasonably should
15 have known of the purchaser's intention to export or
16 resell the motor vehicle. There is a rebuttable
17 presumption that the new motor vehicle dealer did not
18 know or could not have known that the vehicle would be
19 exported if the vehicle is titled and registered in
20 any state of the United States, or
21 i. (1) notwithstanding the terms of a franchise
22 agreement or other agreement providing otherwise,
23 requires a new motor vehicle dealer to purchase
24 or utilize goods or services, or contract with
Req. No. 12234 Page 47

1 any vendor, identified, selected or designated by
2 the factory for the:
3 (a) operation of the dealership including
4 electronic services such as websites, data
5 management or storage systems, digital
6 retail platforms, software, or other digital
7 services or platforms, or
8 (b) construction, renovation, or improvement of
9 the new motor vehicle dealer's facility from
10 a vendor chosen by the factory if goods or
11 services available from other sources a
12 vendor that the new motor vehicle dealer
13 chooses, are of substantially similar
14 quality and design and comply with all
15 applicable laws; provided, however, that
16 such goods are not subject to the factory's
17 intellectual property or trademark rights
18 and the new motor vehicle dealer has
19 received the factory's approval, which
20 approval may not be unreasonably withheld.
21 Nothing in this subparagraph may be
22 construed to allow a new motor vehicle
23 dealer to impair or eliminate a factory's
24 intellectual property, trademark rights, or
Req. No. 12234 Page 48

1 trade dress usage guidelines. Nothing in
2 this section prohibits the enforcement of a
3 voluntary agreement between the factory and
4 the new motor vehicle dealer where separate
5 and valuable consideration has been offered
6 and accepted. It is a violation of this
7 subparagraph for a factory, or any entity
8 that acts on behalf of, a factory to coerce
9 a new motor vehicle dealer to purchase or
10 utilize certain goods or services by the
11 withholding of any benefit, including
12 monetary incentives paid on a per vehicle
13 basis and vehicle allocation the new motor
14 vehicle dealer is otherwise eligible to
15 receive, and
16 (2) for the purposes of this subparagraph, "goods and
17 services" do not include:
18 (a) moveable displays, brochures, or promotional
19 materials containing material subject to the
20 intellectual property rights of a factory or
21 parts to be used in repairs under warranty
22 obligations of a factory, or
23
24
Req. No. 12234 Page 49

1 (b) special tools or training required by the
2 factory to perform warranty or recall
3 repairs;
4 10. Being a factory that:
5 a. establishes a system of motor vehicle allocation or
6 distribution which is unfair, inequitable, or
7 unreasonably discriminatory. A manufacturer and
8 distributor shall maintain for three (3) years records
9 that describe its methods or formula of allocation and
10 distribution of its motor vehicles and records of its
11 actual allocation and distribution of motor vehicles
12 to its motor vehicle dealers. Upon the written
13 request of any new motor vehicle dealer franchised by
14 the manufacturer or distributor, received by the
15 manufacturer or distributor within thirty (30) days of
16 the manufacturer's or distributor's written notice to
17 the dealer of its intention to cancel or terminate, or
18 written notice from the manufacturer or distributor of
19 a sales performance deficiency requiring the dealer to
20 take action to cure the alleged performance
21 deficiency, a manufacturer or distributor shall
22 disclose in writing to the new motor vehicle dealer
23 the basis upon which new motor vehicles are allocated,
24 scheduled, and delivered, by vehicle model, to new
Req. No. 12234 Page 50

1 motor vehicle dealers of the same line-make for that
2 manufacturer or distributor for the prior three (3)
3 years, and the basis upon which the current allocation
4 or distribution is being made or will be made based on
5 existing information to such dealer, or
6 b. changes an established plan or system of motor vehicle
7 distribution. A new motor vehicle dealer franchise
8 agreement shall continue in full force and operation
9 notwithstanding a change, in whole or in part, of an
10 established plan or system of distribution of the
11 motor vehicles offered or previously offered for sale
12 under the franchise agreement. The appointment of a
13 new importer or distributor for motor vehicles offered
14 for sale under the franchise agreement shall be deemed
15 to be a change of an established plan or system of
16 distribution. The discontinuation of a line-make
17 shall not be deemed to be a change of an established
18 plan or system of motor vehicle distribution. The
19 creation of a line-make shall not be deemed to be a
20 change of an established plan or system of motor
21 vehicle distribution as long as the new line-make is
22 not selling the same, or substantially the same
23 vehicle or vehicles previously sold through another
24 line-make by new motor vehicle dealers with an active
Req. No. 12234 Page 51

1 franchise agreement for the other line-make in the
2 state if such new motor vehicle dealers are no longer
3 authorized to sell the comparable vehicle previously
4 sold through their line-make. Changing a vehicle's
5 powertrain is not sufficient to show it is
6 substantially different. Upon the occurrence of such
7 change, the manufacturer or distributor shall be
8 prohibited from obtaining a license to distribute
9 vehicles under the new plan or system of distribution
10 unless the manufacturer or distributor offers to each
11 new motor vehicle dealer who is a party to the
12 franchise agreement a new franchise agreement
13 containing substantially the same provisions which
14 were contained in the previous franchise agreement;
15 11. Being a factory that sells directly or indirectly new motor
16 vehicles to any retail consumer in the state except through a new
17 motor vehicle dealer holding a franchise for the line-make that
18 includes the new motor vehicle. This paragraph does not apply to
19 factory sales of new motor vehicles to its employees, family members
20 of employees, retirees and family members of retirees, not-for-
21 profit organizations, or the federal, state, or local governments.
22 The provisions of this paragraph shall not preclude a factory from
23 providing information to a consumer for the purpose of marketing or
24 facilitating a sale of a new motor vehicle or from establishing a
Req. No. 12234 Page 52

1 prog ram to sell or offer to sell new motor vehicles through
2 participating dealers subject to the limitations provided in
3 paragraph 2 of Section 562 of this title;
4 12. a. Being a factory which directly or indirectly:
5 (1) owns any ownership interest or has any financial
6 interest in a new motor vehicle dealer or any
7 person who sells products or services pursuant to
8 the terms of the franchise agreement,
9 (2) operates or controls a new motor vehicle dealer,
10 or
11 (3) acts in the capacity of a new motor vehicle
12 dealer.
13 b. (1) This paragraph does not prohibit a factory from
14 owning or controlling a new motor vehicle dealer
15 while in a bona fide relationship with a dealer
16 development candidate who has made a substantial
17 initial investment in the franchise and whose
18 initial investment is subject to potential loss.
19 The dealer development candidate can reasonably
20 expect to acquire full ownership of a new motor
21 vehicle dealer within a reasonable period of time
22 not to exceed ten (10) years and on reasonable
23 terms and conditions. The ten-year acquisition
24 period may be expanded for good cause shown.
Req. No. 12234 Page 53

1 (2) This paragraph does not prohibit a factory from
2 owning, operating, controlling, or acting in the
3 capacity of a new motor vehicle dealer for a
4 period not to exceed twelve (12) months during
5 the transition from one independent dealer to
6 another independent dealer if the dealership is
7 for sale at a reasonable price and on reasonable
8 terms and conditions to an independent qualified
9 buyer. On showing by a factory of good cause,
10 the Oklahoma New Motor Vehicle Commission may
11 extend the time limit set forth above; extensions
12 may be granted for periods not to exceed twelve
13 (12) months.
14 (3) This paragraph does not prohibit a factory from
15 owning, operating, or controlling or acting in
16 the capacity of a new motor vehicle dealer which
17 was in operation prior to January 1, 2000.
18 (4) This paragraph does not prohibit a factory from
19 owning, directly or indirectly, a minority
20 interest in an entity that owns, operates, or
21 controls motor vehicle dealerships of the same
22 line-make franchised by the manufacturer,
23 provided that each of the following conditions
24 are met:
Req. No. 12234 Page 54

1 (a) all of the new motor vehicle dealerships
2 selling the motor vehicles of that
3 manufacturer in this state trade exclusively
4 in the line-make of that manufacturer,
5 (b) all of the franchise agreements of the
6 manufacturer confer rights on the dealer of
7 the line-make to develop and operate, within
8 a defined geographic territory or area, as

11 (c) at the time the manufacturer first acquires
12 an ownership interest or assumes operation,
13 the distance between any dealership thus
14 owned or operated and the nearest
15 unaffiliated new motor vehicle dealership
16 trading in the same line-make is not less
17 than seventy (70) miles,
18 (d) during any period in which the manufacturer
19 has such an ownership interest, the
20 manufacturer has no more than three
21 franchise agreements with new motor vehicle
22 dealers licensed by the Oklahoma New Motor
23 Vehicle Commission to do business within the
24 state, and
Req. No. 12234 Page 55

1 (e) prior to January 1, 2000, the factory shall
2 have furnished or made available to
3 prospective new motor vehicle dealers an
4 offering circular in accordance with the
5 Trade Regulation Rule on Franchising of the
6 Federal Trade Commission, and any guidelines
7 and exemptions issued thereunder, which
8 disclose the possibility that the factory
9 may from time to time seek to own or
10 acquire, directly or indirectly, ownership
11 interests in retail dealerships;
12 13. Being a factory which directly or indirectly makes
13 available for public disclosure any proprietary information provided
14 to the factory by a new motor vehicle dealer, other than in
15 composite form to new motor vehicle dealers in the same line-make or
16 in response to a subpoena or order of the Commission or a court.
17 Proprietary information includes, but is not limited to,
18 information:
19 a. derived from monthly financial statements provided to
20 the factory, and
21 b. regarding any aspect of the profitability of a

2 consumer in providing or directing a lead;
3 15. Being a factory which used the consumer list of a new motor
4 vehicle dealer for the purpose of unfairly competing with dealers;
5 16. Being a factory which prohibits a new motor vehicle dealer
6 from relocating after a written request by such new motor vehicle
7 dealer if:
8 a. the facility and the proposed new location satisfies
9 or meets the written reasonable guidelines of the

12 forth in subparagraphs f and g of paragraph 9 of this
13 subsection,

16 pursuant to Section 578.1 of this title, and
17 c. the factory has sixty (60) days from receipt of the
18 new motor vehicle dealer's relocation request to
19 approve or deny the request. The failure to approve
20 or deny the request within the sixty-day time frame
21 shall constitute approval of the request;
22 17. Being a factory which prohibits a new motor vehicle dealer
23 from adding additional line-makes to its existing facility, if,
24 after adding the additional line-makes, the facility satisfies the
Req. No. 12234 Page 57

1 writ ten reasonable capitalization standards and facility guidelines

6 among the vehicles available for sale under the dealer’s franchised
7 line-make, or the new motor vehicle dealer has notified the
8 manufacturer or distributor of the new motor vehicle dealer's
9 intention to begin selling and servicing electric vehicles
10 manufactured or distributed by that factory. If the new motor
11 vehicle dealer's franchise identifies electric vehicle models or the
12 dealer is actually offering for sale to the public or providing

17 b. the dealer submits its request to the manufacturer or
18 distributor in writing and within twenty-four (24)

19 attorney fees which do not exceed the usual, customary, and
20 reasonable fees charged for similar work done for other clients
21 incurred by the proposed new owner and transferee prior to the
22 exercise by the factory of its right of first refusal in negotiating
23 and implementing the contract for the proposed sale or transfer of
24 the dealership or dealership assets. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Req. No. 12234 Page 62

1 no p ayment of expenses and attorney fees shall be required if the

10 fitness or ability to perform one or more of the duties or
