11 whichever is less, covering repairs made no more than
12 one hundred eighty (180) days before the submission
13 and declaring the average percentage labor rate and/or
14 markup rate. A new motor vehicle dealer may not

16 than once in a twelve-month period. That request may
17 establish a parts markup rate, labor rate, or both.
18 The new motor vehicle dealer shall calculate its
19 retail parts rate by determining the total charges for
20 parts from the qualified repair orders submitted,
21 dividing that amount by the new motor vehicle dealer's
22 total cost of the purchase of those parts, subtracting
23 one (1), and multiplying by one hundred (100) to
24 produce a percentage. The new motor vehicle dealer

1 shall calculate its retail labor rate by dividing the
2 amount of the new motor vehicle dealer's total labor
3 sales from the qualified repair orders by the total

5 repair orders to establish a retail parts and labor
6 rate, a new motor vehicle dealer need not include
7 repairs for:
8 (1) routine maintenance including but not limited to
9 the replacement of bulbs, fluids, filters,

7 fasteners.
8 A manufacturer or distributor may, not later than
9 forty-five (45) days after submission, rebut that
10 declared retail parts and labor rate in writing by
11 reasonably substantiating that the rate is not
12 accurate or is incomplete pursuant to the provisions
13 of this section. If the manufacturer or distributor
14 determines the set of repair orders submitted by the
15 new motor vehicle dealer pursuant to this section for
16 a retail labor rate or retail parts markup rate is
17 substantially higher than the new motor vehicle
18 dealer's current warranty rates, the manufacturer or
19 distributor may request, in writing, within forty-five
20 (45) days after the manufacturer's or distributor's
21 receipt of the new motor vehicle dealer's initial
22 submission, all repair orders closed within the period
23 of thirty (30) days immediately preceding, or thirty
24 (30) days immediately following, the set of repair

5 supplemental repair orders, the manufacturer or
6 distributor may, within thirty (30) days after
7 receiving the supplemental repair orders and in
8 accordance with the formula described in this
9 subsection, calculate a proposed adjusted retail labor
10 rate or retail parts markup rate, as applicable, based
11 upon any set of the qualified repair orders submitted
12 by the franchisee and following the formula set forth
13 herein to establish the rate. The retail labor and
14 parts rates shall go into effect thirty (30) days
15 following the approval by the manufacturer or
16 distributor. If the declared rate is rebutted, the
17 manufacturer or distributor shall provide written
18 notice stating the reasons for the rebuttal, an
19 explanation of the reasons for the rebuttal, and a
20 copy of all calculations used by the franchisor in
21 determining the manufacturer or distributor's position
22 and propose an adjustment in writing of the average
23 percentage markup or labor rate based on that rebuttal
24 not later than forty-five (45) days after submission.

1 If the new motor vehicle dealer does not agree with
2 the proposed average percentage markup or labor rate,
3 the new motor vehicle dealer may file a protest with
4 the Commission not later than thirty (30) days after
5 receipt of that proposal by the manufacturer or
6 distributor. In the event a protest is filed, the
7 manufacturer or distributor shall have the burden of
8 proof to establish the new motor vehicle dealer's
9 submitted parts markup rate or labor rate was
10 inaccurate or not complete pursuant to the provisions
11 of this section. A manufacturer or distributor may
12 not retaliate against any new motor vehicle dealer
13 seeking to exercise its rights under this section. A
14 manufacturer or distributor may require a dealer to
15 submit repair orders in accordance with this section
16 in order to validate the reasonableness of a dealer's
17 retail rate for parts or labor not more often than
18 once every twelve (12) months. A manufacturer or
19 distributor may not otherwise recover its costs from
20 new motor vehicle dealers within this state including
21 a surcharge imposed on a new motor vehicle dealer
22 solely intended to recover the cost of reimbursing a
23 new motor vehicle dealer for parts and labor pursuant
24 to this section; provided, a manufacturer or

1 distributor shall not be prohibited from increasing
2 prices for vehicles or parts in the normal course of
3 business or from auditing and charging back claims in
4 accordance with this section. All claims made by
5 dealers for compensation for delivery, preparation,
6 warranty, or recall repair work shall be paid within
7 thirty (30) days after approval and shall be approved
8 or disapproved within thirty (30) days after receipt.
9 When any claim is disapproved, the dealer shall be
10 notified in writing of the grounds for disapproval.
11 The dealer's delivery, preparation, and warranty
12 obligations as filed with the Commission shall
13 constitute the dealer's sole responsibility for
14 product liability as between the dealer and
15 manufacturer. A factory may reasonably and
16 periodically audit a new motor vehicle dealer to
17 determine the validity of paid claims for new motor
18 vehicle dealer compensation or any charge-backs for
19 warranty parts or service compensation. Except in
20 cases of suspected fraud, audits of warranty payments
21 shall only be for the one-year period immediately
22 following the date of the payment. A manufacturer

24 to determine the validity of paid claims for dealer

1 compensation or any charge-backs for consumer or
2 dealer incentives. Except in cases of suspected
3 fraud, audits of incentive payments shall only be for
4 a one-year period immediately following the date of
5 the payment. A factory shall not deny a claim or
6 charge a new motor vehicle dealer back subsequent to
7 the payment of the claim unless the factory can show
8 that the claim was false or fraudulent or that the new
9 motor vehicle dealer failed to reasonably substantiate
10 the claim by the written reasonable procedures of the
11 factory. A factory shall not deny a claim or
12 implement a charge-back against a new motor vehicle
13 dealer after payment of a claim in the event a
14 purchaser of a new vehicle that is the subject of a
15 claim fails to comply with titling or registration
16 laws of this state and is not prevented from
17 compliance by any action of the new motor vehicle
18 dealer; provided, that the factory may require the new
19 motor vehicle dealer to provide, within thirty (30)
20 days of notice of charge-back, withholding of payment,
21 or denial of claim, the documentation to demonstrate
22 the vehicle sale, delivery, and customer qualification

9 notice of a proposed charge-back pursuant to a
10 factory's audit has the right to file a protest with
11 the Commission within thirty (30) days after receipt
12 of the notice of the charge-back or audit results,
13 whichever is later. The factory is prohibited from
14 implementing the charge-back or debiting the dealer's
15 account until either the time frame for filing a
16 protest has passed or a final adjudication is rendered
17 by the Commission, whichever is later, unless the
18 dealer has agreed to the charge-back or charge-backs,

10 exceed the total average Black Book value of the
11 affected used motor vehicle as originally determined

7 facility or substantially renovate the new motor
8 vehicle dealer's existing facility unless the facility
9 construction or renovation is justified by the
10 economic conditions existing at the time, as well as
11 the reasonably foreseeable projections, in the new
12 motor vehicle dealer's market and in the automotive
13 industry. However, this subparagraph shall not apply
14 if the new motor vehicle dealer voluntarily agrees to
15 facility construction or renovation in exchange for
16 money, credit, allowance, reimbursement, or additional
17 vehicle allocation to a new motor vehicle dealer from
18 the factory to compensate the new motor vehicle dealer
19 for the cost of, or a portion of the cost of, the
20 facility construction or renovation. Except as
21 necessary to comply with a health or safety law, or to
22 comply with a technology or safety requirement which
23 is necessary to sell or service a motor vehicle that
24 the franchised new motor vehicle dealer is authorized

1 or licensed by the franchisor to sell or service, a
2 new motor vehicle dealer which completes a facility
3 construction or renovation pursuant to factory
4 requirements shall not be required to construct a new
5 facility or renovate the existing facility if the same
6 area of the facility or premises has been constructed
7 or substantially altered within the last ten (10)
8 years and the construction or alteration was approved
9 by the manufacturer as a part of a facility upgrade
10 program, standard, or policy. For purposes of this
11 subparagraph, "substantially altered" means to perform
12 an alteration that substantially impacts the
13 architectural features, characteristics, or integrity
14 of a structure or lot. The term shall not include
15 routine maintenance reasonably necessary to maintain a
16 dealership in attractive condition. If a facility
17 upgrade program, standard, or policy under which the
18 dealer completed a facility construction or
19 substantial alteration does not contain a specific
20 time period during which the manufacturer or
21 distributor shall provide payments or benefits to a
22 participating dealer, or the time frame specified
23 under the program is reduced or canceled prematurely
24 in the unilateral discretion of the manufacturer or

1 distributor, the manufacturer or distributor shall not
2 deny the participating dealer any payment or benefit
3 under the terms of the program, standard, or policy as
4 it existed when the dealer began to perform under the
5 program, standard, or policy for the balance of the
6 ten-year period, regardless of whether the
7 manufacturer's or distributor's program, standard, or
8 policy has been changed or canceled, unless the
9 manufacturer and dealer agree, in writing, to the
10 change in payment or benefit. During the ten-year
11 period following facility construction or substantial
12 alteration, the manufacturer shall not fail to make
13 available to the dealer a fair and proportionate share
14 of all new vehicles distributed to dealers of the same
15 line-make in this state, subject to the same
16 reasonable terms, including vehicles distributed from
17 a common new vehicle inventory pool outside of the
18 factory's ordinary allocation process, such as any
19 vehicles the factory reserves to distribute on a
20 discretionary basis,
21 f. requires a new motor vehicle dealer to establish an
22 exclusive facility or to change the location of the
23 dealership, unless supported by reasonable business,
24 market, and economic considerations; provided, that
HB2158 HFLR Page 45

1 this section shall not restrict the terms of any
2 agreement for such exclusive facility voluntarily
3 entered into and supported by valuable consideration
4 separate from the new motor vehicle dealer's right to
5 sell and service motor vehicles for the franchisor.
6 If a dealer is required by the manufacturer or
7 distributor to change an existing, previously approved
8 location of the dealership and has not sold its
9 existing dealership facility and real estate within
10 the later of one hundred eighty (180) days of listing
11 the property for sale or ninety (90) days after the
12 facility relocation, then, upon the written request of
13 the dealer, the manufacturer or distributor shall
14 purchase the dealer's existing dealership facility and
15 real estate as if the new motor vehicle dealership
16 continues to operate on the property. If the factory
17 and dealer cannot agree on the value of the dealership
18 facilities and real estate, then the factory and
19 dealer shall utilize the process described in
20 paragraph 6 of subsection G of Section 565.2 of this
21 title. If a manufacturer or distributor purchases a
22 dealership facility and real estate, then it shall be
23 entitled to sole ownership, possession, use, and

2 included in the contract to purchase,
3 g. requires a new motor vehicle dealer to enter into a
4 site-control agreement covering any or all of the new
5 motor vehicle dealer's facilities or premises;
6 provided, that this section shall not restrict the
7 terms of any site-control agreement voluntarily
8 entered into and supported by valuable consideration
9 separate from the new motor vehicle dealer's right to
10 sell and service motor vehicles for the franchisor.
11 Notwithstanding the foregoing or the terms of any
12 site-control agreement, a site-control agreement
13 automatically extinguishes if all of the factory's
14 franchises that operated from the location that are
15 the subject of the site-control agreement are
16 terminated by the factory as part of the
17 discontinuance of a product line,
18 h. refuses to pay, or claims reimbursement from, a new
19 motor vehicle dealer for sales, incentives, or other
20 payments related to a motor vehicle sold by the new
21 motor vehicle dealer because the purchaser of the
22 motor vehicle exported or resold the motor vehicle in
23 violation of the policy of the factory unless the
24 factory can show that, at the time of the sale, the
HB2158 HFLR Page 47
BOLD FACE denotes Committee Amendments.
1 new motor vehicle dealer knew or reasonably should
2 have known of the purchaser's intention to export or
3 resell the motor vehicle. There is a rebuttable
4 presumption that the new motor vehicle dealer did not
5 know or could not have known that the vehicle would be
6 exported if the vehicle is titled and registered in
7 any state of the United States, or
8 i. (1) notwithstanding the terms of a franchise
9 agreement or other agreement providing otherwise,
10 requires a new motor vehicle dealer to purchase
11 or utilize goods or services, or contract with
12 any vendor, identified, selected or designated by
13 the factory for the:
14 (a) operation of the dealership including
15 electronic services such as websites, data
16 management or storage systems, digital
17 retail platforms, software, or other digital
18 services or platforms, or
19 (b) construction, renovation, or improvement of
20 the new motor vehicle dealer's facility from
21 a vendor chosen by the factory if goods or
22 services available from other sources a
23 vendor that the new motor vehicle dealer
24 chooses, are of substantially similar

1 quality and design and comply with all
2 applicable laws; provided, however, that
3 such goods are not subject to the factory's
4 intellectual property or trademark rights
5 and the new motor vehicle dealer has
6 received the factory's approval, which
7 approval may not be unreasonably withheld.
8 Nothing in this subparagraph may be
9 construed to allow a new motor vehicle
10 dealer to impair or eliminate a factory's
11 intellectual property, trademark rights, or
12 trade dress usage guidelines. Nothing in
13 this section prohibits the enforcement of a
14 voluntary agreement between the factory and
15 the new motor vehicle dealer where separate
16 and valuable consideration has been offered
17 and accepted. It is a violation of this
18 subparagraph for a factory, or any entity
19 that acts on behalf of, a factory to coerce
20 a new motor vehicle dealer to purchase or
21 utilize certain goods or services by the
22 withholding of any benefit, including
23 monetary incentives paid on a per vehicle
24 basis and vehicle allocation the new motor

5 (a) moveable displays, brochures, or promotional
6 materials containing material subject to the
7 intellectual property rights of a factory or
8 parts to be used in repairs under warranty
9 obligations of a factory, or
10 (b) special tools or training required by the
11 factory to perform warranty or recall
12 repairs;
13 10. Being a factory that:
14 a. establishes a system of motor vehicle allocation or
15 distribution which is unfair, inequitable, or
16 unreasonably discriminatory. A manufacturer and
17 distributor shall maintain for three (3) years records
18 that describe its methods or formula of allocation and
19 distribution of its motor vehicles and records of its
20 actual allocation and distribution of motor vehicles
21 to its motor vehicle dealers. Upon the written
22 request of any new motor vehicle dealer franchised by
23 the manufacturer or distributor, received by the
24 manufacturer or distributor within thirty (30) days of
HB2158 HFLR Page 50
BOLD FACE denotes Committee Amendments.
1 the manufacturer's or distributor's written notice to
2 the dealer of its intention to cancel or terminate, or
3 written notice from the manufacturer or distributor of
4 a sales performance deficiency requiring the dealer to
5 take action to cure the alleged performance
6 deficiency, a manufacturer or distributor shall
7 disclose in writing to the new motor vehicle dealer
8 the basis upon which new motor vehicles are allocated,
9 scheduled, and delivered, by vehicle model, to new
10 motor vehicle dealers of the same line-make for that
11 manufacturer or distributor for the prior three (3)
12 years, and the basis upon which the current allocation
13 or distribution is being made or will be made based on
14 existing information to such dealer, or
15 b. changes an established plan or system of motor vehicle
16 distribution. A new motor vehicle dealer franchise
17 agreement shall continue in full force and operation
18 notwithstanding a change, in whole or in part, of an
19 established plan or system of distribution of the
20 motor vehicles offered or previously offered for sale
21 under the franchise agreement. The appointment of a
22 new importer or distributor for motor vehicles offered
23 for sale under the franchise agreement shall be deemed
24 to be a change of an established plan or system of
HB2158 HFLR Page 51
BOLD FACE denotes Committee Amendments.
1 distribution. The discontinuation of a line-make
2 shall not be deemed to be a change of an established
3 plan or system of motor vehicle distribution. The
4 creation of a line-make shall not be deemed to be a
5 change of an established plan or system of motor
6 vehicle distribution as long as the new line-make is
7 not selling the same, or substantially the same
8 vehicle or vehicles previously sold through another
9 line-make by new motor vehicle dealers with an active
10 franchise agreement for the other line-make in the
11 state if such new motor vehicle dealers are no longer
12 authorized to sell the comparable vehicle previously
13 sold through their line-make. Changing a vehicle's
14 powertrain is not sufficient to show it is
15 substantially different. Upon the occurrence of such
16 change, the manufacturer or distributor shall be
17 prohibited from obtaining a license to distribute
18 vehicles under the new plan or system of distribution
19 unless the manufacturer or distributor offers to each
20 new motor vehicle dealer who is a party to the
21 franchise agreement a new franchise agreement
22 containing substantially the same provisions which
23 were contained in the previous franchise agreement;
24

5 factory sales of new motor vehicles to its employees, family members
6 of employees, retirees and family members of retirees, not-for-

8 The provisions of this paragraph shall not preclude a factory from
9 providing information to a consumer for the purpose of marketing or

19 (2) operates or controls a new motor vehicle dealer,
20 or
21 (3) acts in the capacity of a new motor vehicle

2 development candidate who has made a substantial
3 initial investment in the franchise and whose
4 initial investment is subject to potential loss.
5 The dealer development candidate can reasonably
6 expect to acquire full ownership of a new motor
7 vehicle dealer within a reasonable period of time
8 not to exceed ten (10) years and on reasonable
9 terms and conditions. The ten-year acquisition
10 period may be expanded for good cause shown.
11 (2) This paragraph does not prohibit a factory from

16 another independent dealer if the dealership is
17 for sale at a reasonable price and on reasonable
18 terms and conditions to an independent qualified
19 buyer. On showing by a factory of good cause,
20 the Oklahoma New Motor Vehicle Commission may
21 extend the time limit set forth above; extensions
22 may be granted for periods not to exceed twelve
23 (12) months.

6 owning, directly or indirectly, a minority
7 interest in an entity that owns, operates, or
8 controls motor vehicle dealerships of the same
9 line-make franchised by the manufacturer,
10 provided that each of the following conditions

18 The new motor vehicle dealer shall calculate its
19 retail parts rate by determining the total charges for
20 parts from the qualified repair orders submitted,
21 dividing that amount by the new motor vehicle dealer's

9 forty-five (45) days after submission, rebut that
10 declared retail parts and labor rate in writing by
11 reasonably substantiating that the rate is not
12 accurate or is incomplete pursuant to the provisions
13 of this section. If the manufacturer or distributor
14 determines the set of repair orders submitted by the
15 new motor vehicle dealer pursuant to this section for
16 a retail labor rate or retail parts markup rate is
17 substantially higher than the new motor vehicle
18 dealer's current warranty rates, the manufacturer or
19 distributor may request, in writing, within forty-five
20 (45) days after the manufacturer's or distributor's

7 receiving the supplemental repair orders and in
8 accordance with the formula described in this
9 subsection, calculate a proposed adjusted retail labor
10 rate or retail parts markup rate, as applicable, based
11 upon any set of the qualified repair orders submitted
12 by the franchisee and following the formula set forth
13 herein to establish the rate. The retail labor and
14 parts rates shall go into effect thirty (30) days
15 following the approval by the manufacturer or
16 distributor. If the declared rate is rebutted, the
17 manufacturer or distributor shall provide written
18 notice stating the reasons for the rebuttal, an
19 explanation of the reasons for the rebuttal, and a
20 copy of all calculations used by the franchisor in
21 determining the manufacturer or distributor's position
22 and propose an adjustment in writing of the average
23 percentage markup or labor rate based on that rebuttal

10 inaccurate or not complete pursuant to the provisions
11 of this section. A manufacturer or distributor may
12 not retaliate against any new motor vehicle dealer
13 seeking to exercise its rights under this section. A

15 submit repair orders in accordance with this section
16 in order to validate the reasonableness of a dealer's
17 retail rate for parts or labor not more often than
18 once every twelve (12) months. A manufacturer or

7 the payment of the claim unless the factory can show
8 that the claim was false or fraudulent or that the new
9 motor vehicle dealer failed to reasonably substantiate
10 the claim by the written reasonable procedures of the
11 factory. A factory shall not deny a claim or
12 implement a charge-back against a new motor vehicle
13 dealer after payment of a claim in the event a
14 purchaser of a new vehicle that is the subject of a
15 claim fails to comply with titling or registration
16 laws of this state and is not prevented from
17 compliance by any action of the new motor vehicle
18 dealer; provided, that the factory may require the new
19 motor vehicle dealer to provide, within thirty (30)
20 days of notice of charge-back, withholding of payment,
21 or denial of claim, the documentation to demonstrate
22 the vehicle sale, delivery, and customer qualification

10 factory's audit has the right to file a protest with
11 the Commission within thirty (30) days after receipt
12 of the notice of the charge-back or audit results,
13 whichever is later. The factory is prohibited from
14 implementing the charge-back or debiting the dealer's
15 account until either the time frame for filing a
16 protest has passed or a final adjudication is rendered

4 facilities as a prerequisite to receiving a model or
5 series of vehicles, except as may be necessary to sell
6 or service the model or series of vehicles as provided
7 by subparagraph e of this paragraph. It shall be a
8 violation of this section for new vehicle allocation
9 to be withheld subject to any requirement to purchase
10 or sell any number of used or off-lease vehicles. The
11 failure to deliver any such new motor vehicle shall
12 not be considered a violation of the section if the
13 failure is not arbitrary or is due to lack of
14 manufacturing capacity or to a strike or labor
15 difficulty, a shortage of materials, a freight
16 embargo, or other cause over which the manufacturer
17 has no control. However, this subparagraph shall not
18 apply to recreational vehicles, limited production
19 model vehicles, a vehicle not advertised by the
20 factory for sale in this state, vehicles that are

7 facility or substantially renovate the new motor
8 vehicle dealer's existing facility unless the facility
9 construction or renovation is justified by the
10 economic conditions existing at the time, as well as
11 the reasonably foreseeable projections, in the new
12 motor vehicle dealer's market and in the automotive
13 industry. However, this subparagraph shall not apply
14 if the new motor vehicle dealer voluntarily agrees to
15 facility construction or renovation in exchange for
16 money, credit, allowance, reimbursement, or additional
17 vehicle allocation to a new motor vehicle dealer from
18 the factory to compensate the new motor vehicle dealer
19 for the cost of, or a portion of the cost of, the

5 facility or renovate the existing facility if the same
6 area of the facility or premises has been constructed
7 or substantially altered within the last ten (10)
8 years and the construction or alteration was approved
9 by the manufacturer as a part of a facility upgrade
10 program, standard, or policy. For purposes of this
11 subparagraph, "substantially altered" means to perform
12 an alteration that substantially impacts the
13 architectural features, characteristics, or integrity
14 of a structure or lot. The term shall not include
15 routine maintenance reasonably necessary to maintain a
16 dealership in attractive condition. If a facility
17 upgrade program, standard, or policy under which the
18 dealer completed a facility construction or
19 substantial alteration does not contain a specific
20 time period during which the manufacturer or

6 ten-year period, regardless of whether the
7 manufacturer's or distributor's program, standard, or
8 policy has been changed or canceled, unless the
9 manufacturer and dealer agree, in writing, to the
10 change in payment or benefit. During the ten-year
11 period following facility construction or substantial
12 alteration, the manufacturer shall not fail to make
13 available to the dealer a fair and proportionate share
14 of all new vehicles distributed to dealers of the same
15 line-make in this state, subject to the same
16 reasonable terms, including vehicles distributed from
17 a common new vehicle inventory pool outside of the
18 factory's ordinary allocation process, such as any
19 vehicles the factory reserves to distribute on a
20 discretionary basis,

5 sell and service motor vehicles for the franchisor.
6 If a dealer is required by the manufacturer or
7 distributor to change an existing, previously approved
8 location of the dealership and has not sold its
9 existing dealership facility and real estate within
10 the later of one hundred eighty (180) days of listing
11 the property for sale or ninety (90) days after the
12 facility relocation, then, upon the written request of
13 the dealer, the manufacturer or distributor shall
14 purchase the dealer's existing dealership facility and
15 real estate as if the new motor vehicle dealership
16 continues to operate on the property. If the factory
17 and dealer cannot agree on the value of the dealership
18 facilities and real estate, then the factory and
19 dealer shall utilize the process described in
20 paragraph 6 of subsection G of Section 565.2 of this
21 title. If a manufacturer or distributor purchases a
22 dealership facility and real estate, then it shall be
23 entitled to sole ownership, possession, use, and

7 terms of any site-control agreement voluntarily
8 entered into and supported by valuable consideration
9 separate from the new motor vehicle dealer's right to
10 sell and service motor vehicles for the franchisor.
11 Notwithstanding the foregoing or the terms of any
12 site-control agreement, a site-control agreement
13 automatically extinguishes if all of the factory's

23 violation of the policy of the factory unless the
24 factory can show that, at the time of the sale, the
HB2158 HFLR Page 47

1 new motor vehicle dealer knew or reasonably should
2 have known of the purchaser's intention to export or
3 resell the motor vehicle. There is a rebuttable
4 presumption that the new motor vehicle dealer did not
5 know or could not have known that the vehicle would be
6 exported if the vehicle is titled and registered in
7 any state of the United States, or
8 i. (1) notwithstanding the terms of a franchise
9 agreement or other agreement providing otherwise,

16 management or storage systems, digital
17 retail platforms, software, or other digital
18 services or platforms, or
19 (b) construction, renovation, or improvement of
20 the new motor vehicle dealer's facility from

3 such goods are not subject to the factory's
4 intellectual property or trademark rights
5 and the new motor vehicle dealer has
6 received the factory's approval, which
7 approval may not be unreasonably withheld.
8 Nothing in this subparagraph may be
9 construed to allow a new motor vehicle
10 dealer to impair or eliminate a factory's
11 intellectual property, trademark rights, or
12 trade dress usage guidelines. Nothing in
13 this section prohibits the enforcement of a
14 voluntary agreement between the factory and
15 the new motor vehicle dealer where separate
16 and valuable consideration has been offered
17 and accepted. It is a violation of this
18 subparagraph for a factory, or any entity
19 that acts on behalf of, a factory to coerce
20 a new motor vehicle dealer to purchase or
21 utilize certain goods or services by the
22 withholding of any benefit, including

12 repairs;
13 10. Being a factory that:
14 a. establishes a system of motor vehicle allocation or
15 distribution which is unfair, inequitable, or
16 unreasonably discriminatory. A manufacturer and
17 distributor shall maintain for three (3) years records
18 that describe its methods or formula of allocation and
19 distribution of its motor vehicles and records of its
20 actual allocation and distribution of motor vehicles
21 to its motor vehicle dealers. Upon the written
22 request of any new motor vehicle dealer franchised by

6 deficiency, a manufacturer or distributor shall
7 disclose in writing to the new motor vehicle dealer
8 the basis upon which new motor vehicles are allocated,
9 scheduled, and delivered, by vehicle model, to new
10 motor vehicle dealers of the same line-make for that
11 manufacturer or distributor for the prior three (3)
12 years, and the basis upon which the current allocation
13 or distribution is being made or will be made based on
14 existing information to such dealer, or
15 b. changes an established plan or system of motor vehicle
16 distribution. A new motor vehicle dealer franchise
17 agreement shall continue in full force and operation
18 notwithstanding a change, in whole or in part, of an
19 established plan or system of distribution of the
20 motor vehicles offered or previously offered for sale
21 under the franchise agreement. The appointment of a
22 new importer or distributor for motor vehicles offered
23 for sale under the franchise agreement shall be deemed
24 to be a change of an established plan or system of

1 distribution. The discontinuation of a line-make
2 shall not be deemed to be a change of an established
3 plan or system of motor vehicle distribution. The
4 creation of a line-make shall not be deemed to be a
5 change of an established plan or system of motor
6 vehicle distribution as long as the new line-make is
7 not selling the same, or substantially the same
8 vehicle or vehicles previously sold through another
9 line-make by new motor vehicle dealers with an active
10 franchise agreement for the other line-make in the
11 state if such new motor vehicle dealers are no longer
12 authorized to sell the comparable vehicle previously
13 sold through their line-make. Changing a vehicle's
14 powertrain is not sufficient to show it is
15 substantially different. Upon the occurrence of such
16 change, the manufacturer or distributor shall be
17 prohibited from obtaining a license to distribute
18 vehicles under the new plan or system of distribution
19 unless the manufacturer or distributor offers to each
20 new motor vehicle dealer who is a party to the

5 factory sales of new motor vehicles to its employees, family members
6 of employees, retirees and family members of retirees, not-for-

8 The provisions of this paragraph shall not preclude a factory from
9 providing information to a consumer for the purpose of marketing or
10 facilitating a sale of a new motor vehicle or from establishing a

5 The dealer development candidate can reasonably
6 expect to acquire full ownership of a new motor
7 vehicle dealer within a reasonable period of time
8 not to exceed ten (10) years and on reasonable
