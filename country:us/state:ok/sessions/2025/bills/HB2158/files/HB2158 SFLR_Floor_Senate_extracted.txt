19 The new motor vehicle dealer shall calculate its
20 retail parts rate by determining the total charges for
21 parts from the qualified repair orders submitted,
22 dividing that amount by the new motor vehicle dealer's
23 total cost of the purchase of those parts, subtracting
24 one (1), and multiplying by one hundred (100) to

1 produce a percentage. The new motor vehicle dealer
2 shall calculate its retail labor rate by dividing the
3 amount of the new motor vehicle dealer's total labor
4 sales from the qualified repair orders by the total
5 labor hours charged for those sales. When submitting
6 repair orders to establish a retail parts and labor
7 rate, a new motor vehicle dealer need not include
8 repairs for:
9 (1) routine maintenance including but not limited to
10 the replacement of bulbs, fluids, filters,

3 the repair,
4 (9) vehicle reconditioning, or
5 (10) items that do not have individual part numbers
6 including, but not limited to, nuts, bolts, and
7 fasteners.
8 A manufacturer or distributor may, not later than
9 forty-five (45) days after submission, rebut that
10 declared retail parts and labor rate in writing by
11 reasonably substantiating that the rate is not
12 accurate or is incomplete pursuant to the provisions
13 of this section. If the manufacturer or distributor
14 determines the set of repair orders submitted by the
15 new motor vehicle dealer pursuant to this section for
16 a retail labor rate or retail parts markup rate is
17 substantially higher than the new motor vehicle
18 dealer's current warranty rates, the manufacturer or
19 distributor may request, in writing, within forty-five
20 (45) days after the manufacturer's or distributor's
21 receipt of the new motor vehicle dealer's initial
22 submission, all repair orders closed within the period
23 of thirty (30) days immediately preceding, or thirty
24 (30) days immediately following, the set of repair

(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)
1 orders initially submitted by the new motor vehicle
2 dealer. All time periods under this section shall be
3 suspended until the supplemental repair orders are
4 provided. If the manufacturer or distributor requests
5 supplemental repair orders, the manufacturer or
6 distributor may, within thirty (30) days after
7 receiving the supplemental repair orders and in
8 accordance with the formula described in this
9 subsection, calculate a proposed adjusted retail labor
10 rate or retail parts markup rate, as applicable, based
11 upon any set of the qualified repair orders submitted
12 by the franchisee and following the formula set forth
13 herein to establish the rate. The retail labor and
14 parts rates shall go into effect thirty (30) days
15 following the approval by the manufacturer or
16 distributor. If the declared rate is rebutted, the
17 manufacturer or distributor shall provide written
18 notice stating the reasons for the rebuttal, an
19 explanation of the reasons for the rebuttal, and a
20 copy of all calculations used by the franchisor in
21 determining the manufacturer or distributor's position
22 and propose an adjustment in writing of the average
23 percentage markup or labor rate based on that rebuttal
24 not later than forty-five (45) days after submission.

1 If the new motor vehicle dealer does not agree with
2 the proposed average percentage markup or labor rate,
3 the new motor vehicle dealer may file a protest with
4 the Commission not later than thirty (30) days after
5 receipt of that proposal by the manufacturer or
6 distributor. In the event a protest is filed, the
7 manufacturer or distributor shall have the burden of
8 proof to establish the new motor vehicle dealer's
9 submitted parts markup rate or labor rate was
10 inaccurate or not complete pursuant to the provisions
11 of this section. A manufacturer or distributor may
12 not retaliate against any new motor vehicle dealer
13 seeking to exercise its rights under this section. A
14 manufacturer or distributor may require a dealer to
15 submit repair orders in accordance with this section
16 in order to validate the reasonableness of a dealer's
17 retail rate for parts or labor not more often than
18 once every twelve (12) months. A manufacturer or
19 distributor may not otherwise recover its costs from
20 new motor vehicle dealers within this state including
21 a surcharge imposed on a new motor vehicle dealer
22 solely intended to recover the cost of reimbursing a
23 new motor vehicle dealer for parts and labor pursuant
24 to this section; provided, a manufacturer or
SENATE FLOOR VERSION - HB2158 SFLR Page 35
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)
1 distributor shall not be prohibited from increasing
2 prices for vehicles or parts in the normal course of
3 business or from auditing and charging back claims in
4 accordance with this section. All claims made by
5 dealers for compensation for delivery, preparation,
6 warranty, or recall repair work shall be paid within
7 thirty (30) days after approval and shall be approved
8 or disapproved within thirty (30) days after receipt.
9 When any claim is disapproved, the dealer shall be
10 notified in writing of the grounds for disapproval.
11 The dealer's delivery, preparation, and warranty
12 obligations as filed with the Commission shall
13 constitute the dealer's sole responsibility for
14 product liability as between the dealer and
15 manufacturer. A factory may reasonably and
16 periodically audit a new motor vehicle dealer to
17 determine the validity of paid claims for new motor
18 vehicle dealer compensation or any charge-backs for
19 warranty parts or service compensation. Except in
20 cases of suspected fraud, audits of warranty payments
21 shall only be for the one-year period immediately
22 following the date of the payment. A manufacturer
23 shall reserve the right to reasonable, periodic audits
24 to determine the validity of paid claims for dealer
SENATE FLOOR VERSION - HB2158 SFLR Page 36
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)
1 compensation or any charge-backs for consumer or
2 dealer incentives. Except in cases of suspected
3 fraud, audits of incentive payments shall only be for
4 a one-year period immediately following the date of
5 the payment. A factory shall not deny a claim or
6 charge a new motor vehicle dealer back subsequent to
7 the payment of the claim unless the factory can show
8 that the claim was false or fraudulent or that the new
9 motor vehicle dealer failed to reasonably substantiate
10 the claim by the written reasonable procedures of the
11 factory. A factory shall not deny a claim or
12 implement a charge-back against a new motor vehicle
13 dealer after payment of a claim in the event a
14 purchaser of a new vehicle that is the subject of a
15 claim fails to comply with titling or registration
16 laws of this state and is not prevented from
17 compliance by any action of the new motor vehicle
18 dealer; provided, that the factory may require the new
19 motor vehicle dealer to provide, within thirty (30)
20 days of notice of charge-back, withholding of payment,
21 or denial of claim, the documentation to demonstrate
22 the vehicle sale, delivery, and customer qualification
23 for an incentive as reported, including consumer name
24 and address and written attestation signed by the

1 dealer operator or general manager stating the
2 consumer was not on the export control list and the
3 dealer did not know or have reason to know the vehicle
4 was being exported or resold.
5 The factory shall provide written notice to a dealer
6 of a proposed charge-back that is the result of an
7 audit along with the specific audit results and
8 proposed charge-back amount. A dealer that receives
9 notice of a proposed charge-back pursuant to a
10 factory's audit has the right to file a protest with
11 the Commission within thirty (30) days after receipt
12 of the notice of the charge-back or audit results,
13 whichever is later. The factory is prohibited from
14 implementing the charge-back or debiting the dealer's
15 account until either the time frame for filing a
16 protest has passed or a final adjudication is rendered
17 by the Commission, whichever is later, unless the
18 dealer has agreed to the charge-back or charge-backs,
19 c. fails to compensate the new motor vehicle dealer for a
20 used motor vehicle:
21 (1) that is of the same make and model manufactured,
22 imported, or distributed by the factory and is a

4 order issued by the factory or an authorized
5 governmental agency,
6 (3) that is held by the new motor vehicle dealer in
7 the dealer's inventory at the time the stop-sale
8 or do-not-drive order is issued or that is taken
9 by the new motor vehicle dealer into the dealer's
10 inventory after the recall notice as a result of
11 a retail consumer trade-in or a lease return to
12 the dealer inventory in accordance with an

7 affected used motor vehicle.
8 For the purposes of division (5) of this subparagraph,
9 the value of a used vehicle shall be the average Black
10 Book value for the year, make, and model of the
11 recalled vehicle. A factory may direct the manner and
12 method in which a new motor vehicle dealer must
13 demonstrate the inventory status of an affected used
14 motor vehicle to determine eligibility under this
15 subparagraph; provided, that the manner and method may
16 not be unduly burdensome and may not require
17 information that is unduly burdensome to provide. All
18 reimbursement claims made by new motor vehicle dealers
19 pursuant to this section for recall remedies or
20 repairs, or for compensation where no part or repair
21 is reasonably available and the vehicle is subject to
22 a stop-sale or do-not-drive order, shall be subject to
23 the same limitations and requirements as a warranty

1 paragraph. In the alternative, a manufacturer may
2 compensate its franchised new motor vehicle dealers
3 under a national recall compensation program;
4 provided, the compensation under the program is equal
5 to or greater than that provided under division (5) of
6 this subparagraph, or as the manufacturer and new
7 motor vehicle dealer otherwise agree. Nothing in this
8 section shall require a factory to provide total
9 compensation to a new motor vehicle dealer which would
10 exceed the total average Black Book value of the
11 affected used motor vehicle as originally determined
12 under division (5) of this subparagraph. Any remedy
13 provided to a new motor vehicle dealer under this
14 subparagraph is exclusive and may not be combined with
15 any other state or federal compensation remedy,
16 d. unreasonably fails or refuses to offer to its same
17 line-make franchised dealers a reasonable supply and

4 facilities as a prerequisite to receiving a model or
5 series of vehicles, except as may be necessary to sell
6 or service the model or series of vehicles as provided
7 by subparagraph e of this paragraph. It shall be a
8 violation of this section for new vehicle allocation
9 to be withheld subject to any requirement to purchase
10 or sell any number of used or off-lease vehicles. The
11 failure to deliver any such new motor vehicle shall
12 not be considered a violation of the section if the
13 failure is not arbitrary or is due to lack of
14 manufacturing capacity or to a strike or labor
15 difficulty, a shortage of materials, a freight
16 embargo, or other cause over which the manufacturer
17 has no control. However, this subparagraph shall not
18 apply to recreational vehicles, limited production
19 model vehicles, a vehicle not advertised by the

6 requires a new motor vehicle dealer to construct a new
7 facility or substantially renovate the new motor
8 vehicle dealer's existing facility unless the facility
9 construction or renovation is justified by the
10 economic conditions existing at the time, as well as
11 the reasonably foreseeable projections, in the new
12 motor vehicle dealer's market and in the automotive
13 industry. However, this subparagraph shall not apply
14 if the new motor vehicle dealer voluntarily agrees to
15 facility construction or renovation in exchange for
16 money, credit, allowance, reimbursement, or additional
17 vehicle allocation to a new motor vehicle dealer from
18 the factory to compensate the new motor vehicle dealer
19 for the cost of, or a portion of the cost of, the

3 construction or renovation pursuant to factory
4 requirements shall not be required to construct a new
5 facility or renovate the existing facility if the same
6 area of the facility or premises has been constructed
7 or substantially altered within the last ten (10)
8 years and the construction or alteration was approved
9 by the manufacturer as a part of a facility upgrade
10 program, standard, or policy. For purposes of this
11 subparagraph, "substantially altered" means to perform
12 an alteration that substantially impacts the
13 architectural features, characteristics, or integrity
14 of a structure or lot. The term shall not include
15 routine maintenance reasonably necessary to maintain a
16 dealership in attractive condition. If a facility
17 upgrade program, standard, or policy under which the
18 dealer completed a facility construction or
19 substantial alteration does not contain a specific
20 time period during which the manufacturer or
21 distributor shall provide payments or benefits to a
22 participating dealer, or the time frame specified
23 under the program is reduced or canceled prematurely
24 in the unilateral discretion of the manufacturer or

1 distributor, the manufacturer or distributor shall not
2 deny the participating dealer any payment or benefit
3 under the terms of the program, standard, or policy as
4 it existed when the dealer began to perform under the
5 program, standard, or policy for the balance of the
6 ten-year period, regardless of whether the
7 manufacturer's or distributor's program, standard, or
8 policy has been changed or canceled, unless the
9 manufacturer and dealer agree, in writing, to the
10 change in payment or benefit. During the ten-year
11 period following facility construction or substantial
12 alteration, the manufacturer shall not fail to make
13 available to the dealer a fair and proportionate share
14 of all new vehicles distributed to dealers of the same
15 line-make in this state, subject to the same
16 reasonable terms, including vehicles distributed from
17 a common new vehicle inventory pool outside of the
18 factory's ordinary allocation process, such as any
19 vehicles the factory reserves to distribute on a
20 discretionary basis,
21 f. requires a new motor vehicle dealer to establish an
22 exclusive facility or to change the location of the
23 dealership, unless supported by reasonable business,

SENATE FLOOR VERSION - HB2158 SFLR Page 45
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)
1 this section shall not restrict the terms of any
2 agreement for such exclusive facility voluntarily
3 entered into and supported by valuable consideration
4 separate from the new motor vehicle dealer's right to
5 sell and service motor vehicles for the franchisor.
6 If a dealer is required by the manufacturer or
7 distributor to change an existing, previously approved
8 location of the dealership and has not sold its
9 existing dealership facility and real estate within
10 the later of one hundred eighty (180) days of listing
11 the property for sale or ninety (90) days after the
12 facility relocation, then, upon the written request of
13 the dealer, the manufacturer or distributor shall
14 purchase the dealer's existing dealership facility and
15 real estate as if the new motor vehicle dealership
16 continues to operate on the property. If the factory
17 and dealer cannot agree on the value of the dealership
18 facilities and real estate, then the factory and
19 dealer shall utilize the process described in
20 paragraph 6 of subsection G of Section 565.2 of this
21 title. If a manufacturer or distributor purchases a
22 dealership facility and real estate, then it shall be
23 entitled to sole ownership, possession, use, and

7 terms of any site-control agreement voluntarily
8 entered into and supported by valuable consideration
9 separate from the new motor vehicle dealer's right to
10 sell and service motor vehicles for the franchisor.
11 Notwithstanding the foregoing or the terms of any
12 site-control agreement, a site-control agreement
13 automatically extinguishes if all of the factory's
14 franchises that operated from the location that are
15 the subject of the site-control agreement are
16 terminated by the factory as part of the
17 discontinuance of a product line,
18 h. refuses to pay, or claims reimbursement from, a new
19 motor vehicle dealer for sales, incentives, or other
20 payments related to a motor vehicle sold by the new

23 violation of the policy of the factory unless the
24 factory can show that, at the time of the sale, the
SENATE FLOOR VERSION - HB2158 SFLR Page 47
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)
1 new motor vehicle dealer knew or reasonably should
2 have known of the purchaser's intention to export or
3 resell the motor vehicle. There is a rebuttable
4 presumption that the new motor vehicle dealer did not
5 know or could not have known that the vehicle would be
6 exported if the vehicle is titled and registered in
7 any state of the United States, or
8 i. (1) notwithstanding the terms of a franchise
9 agreement or other agreement except as provided
10 by this subsection, requires a new motor vehicle
11 dealer to purchase or utilize goods or services,

17 retail platforms, software, or other digital
18 services or platforms, or
19 (b) construction, renovation, or improvement of
20 the new motor vehicle dealer's facility from
21 a vendor chosen by the factory if goods or
22 services available from other sources a
23 vendor that the new motor vehicle dealer
24 chooses, are of substantially similar

(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)
1 quality, function, and design, and comply
2 with all applicable laws; provided, however,
3 that such goods are not subject to the
4 factory's intellectual property or trademark
5 rights and the new motor vehicle dealer has
6 received the factory's approval, which
7 approval may not be unreasonably withheld.
8 Nothing in this subparagraph may be
9 construed to allow a new motor vehicle
10 dealer to impair or eliminate a factory's
11 intellectual property, trademark rights, or
12 trade dress usage guidelines. Nothing in
13 this section subdivision or subdivision a of
14 this division prohibits the enforcement of a
15 voluntary agreement between the factory and
16 the new motor vehicle dealer where separate
17 and valuable consideration has been offered
18 and accepted. It is a violation of this
19 subdivision or subdivision a of this
20 division for a factory, or any entity that
21 acts on behalf of, a factory to coerce a new
22 motor vehicle dealer to purchase or utilize
23 certain goods or services by the withholding

7 containing material subject to the
8 intellectual property rights of a factory or
9 parts to be used in repairs under warranty
10 obligations of a factory, or
11 (b) special tools or training required by the
12 factory to perform warranty or recall
13 repairs;
14 10. Being a factory that:
15 a. establishes a system of motor vehicle allocation or

17 unreasonably discriminatory. A manufacturer and
18 distributor shall maintain for three (3) years records
19 that describe its methods or formula of allocation and
20 distribution of its motor vehicles and records of its
21 actual allocation and distribution of motor vehicles
22 to its motor vehicle dealers. Upon the written
23 request of any new motor vehicle dealer franchised by

1 manufacturer or distributor within thirty (30) days of

3 the dealer of its intention to cancel or terminate, or
4 written notice from the manufacturer or distributor of
5 a sales performance deficiency requiring the dealer to
6 take action to cure the alleged performance
7 deficiency, a manufacturer or distributor shall
8 disclose in writing to the new motor vehicle dealer
9 the basis upon which new motor vehicles are allocated,
10 scheduled, and delivered, by vehicle model, to new
11 motor vehicle dealers of the same line-make for that
12 manufacturer or distributor for the prior three (3)
13 years, and the basis upon which the current allocation
14 or distribution is being made or will be made based on
15 existing information to such dealer, or
16 b. changes an established plan or system of motor vehicle
17 distribution. A new motor vehicle dealer franchise
18 agreement shall continue in full force and operation
19 notwithstanding a change, in whole or in part, of an
20 established plan or system of distribution of the
21 motor vehicles offered or previously offered for sale
22 under the franchise agreement. The appointment of a
23 new importer or distributor for motor vehicles offered
24 for sale under the franchise agreement shall be deemed
SENATE FLOOR VERSION - HB2158 SFLR Page 51
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)
1 to be a change of an established plan or system of
2 distribution. The discontinuation of a line-make
3 shall not be deemed to be a change of an established
4 plan or system of motor vehicle distribution. The
5 creation of a line-make shall not be deemed to be a
6 change of an established plan or system of motor
7 vehicle distribution as long as the new line-make is
8 not selling the same, or substantially the same
9 vehicle or vehicles previously sold through another
10 line-make by new motor vehicle dealers with an active
11 franchise agreement for the other line-make in the
12 state if such new motor vehicle dealers are no longer
13 authorized to sell the comparable vehicle previously
14 sold through their line-make. Changing a vehicle's
15 powertrain is not sufficient to show it is
16 substantially different. Upon the occurrence of such
17 change, the manufacturer or distributor shall be
18 prohibited from obtaining a license to distribute
19 vehicles under the new plan or system of distribution
20 unless the manufacturer or distributor offers to each
21 new motor vehicle dealer who is a party to the
22 franchise agreement a new franchise agreement
23 containing substantially the same provisions which
24 were contained in the previous franchise agreement;

5 The dealer development candidate can reasonably
6 expect to acquire full ownership of a new motor

10 rate or retail parts markup rate, as applicable, based
11 upon any set of the qualified repair orders submitted
12 by the franchisee and following the formula set forth
13 herein to establish the rate. The retail labor and
14 parts rates shall go into effect thirty (30) days
15 following the approval by the manufacturer or
16 distributor. If the declared rate is rebutted, the
17 manufacturer or distributor shall provide written
18 notice stating the reasons for the rebuttal, an
19 explanation of the reasons for the rebuttal, and a

16 in order to validate the reasonableness of a dealer's
17 retail rate for parts or labor not more often than
18 once every twelve (12) months. A manufacturer or

7 the payment of the claim unless the factory can show
8 that the claim was false or fraudulent or that the new
9 motor vehicle dealer failed to reasonably substantiate
10 the claim by the written reasonable procedures of the
11 factory. A factory shall not deny a claim or
12 implement a charge-back against a new motor vehicle
13 dealer after payment of a claim in the event a
14 purchaser of a new vehicle that is the subject of a
15 claim fails to comply with titling or registration
16 laws of this state and is not prevented from
17 compliance by any action of the new motor vehicle
18 dealer; provided, that the factory may require the new

11 the Commission within thirty (30) days after receipt
12 of the notice of the charge-back or audit results,
13 whichever is later. The factory is prohibited from
14 implementing the charge-back or debiting the dealer's
15 account until either the time frame for filing a
16 protest has passed or a final adjudication is rendered

10 Book value for the year, make, and model of the
11 recalled vehicle. A factory may direct the manner and
12 method in which a new motor vehicle dealer must
13 demonstrate the inventory status of an affected used
14 motor vehicle to determine eligibility under this
15 subparagraph; provided, that the manner and method may
16 not be unduly burdensome and may not require
17 information that is unduly burdensome to provide. All
18 reimbursement claims made by new motor vehicle dealers
19 pursuant to this section for recall remedies or
20 repairs, or for compensation where no part or repair
21 is reasonably available and the vehicle is subject to
22 a stop-sale or do-not-drive order, shall be subject to
23 the same limitations and requirements as a warranty
24 reimbursement claim made under subparagraph b of this
SENATE FLOOR VERSION - HB2158 SFLR Page 40
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)

1 paragraph. In the alternative, a manufacturer may
2 compensate its franchised new motor vehicle dealers
3 under a national recall compensation program;
4 provided, the compensation under the program is equal
5 to or greater than that provided under division (5) of
6 this subparagraph, or as the manufacturer and new
7 motor vehicle dealer otherwise agree. Nothing in this
8 section shall require a factory to provide total
9 compensation to a new motor vehicle dealer which would
10 exceed the total average Black Book value of the
11 affected used motor vehicle as originally determined
12 under division (5) of this subparagraph. Any remedy
13 provided to a new motor vehicle dealer under this
14 subparagraph is exclusive and may not be combined with
15 any other state or federal compensation remedy,
16 d. unreasonably fails or refuses to offer to its same
17 line-make franchised dealers a reasonable supply and
18 mix of all models manufactured for that line-make, or
19 unreasonably requires a dealer to pay any extra fee,
20 purchase unreasonable advertising displays or other
21 materials, or enter into a separate agreement which
22 adversely alters the rights or obligations contained
23 within the new motor vehicle dealer's existing
24 franchise agreement or which waives any right of the

1 new motor vehicle dealer as protected by Section 561
2 et seq. of this title, or remodel, renovate, or
3 recondition the new motor vehicle dealer's existing
4 facilities as a prerequisite to receiving a model or
5 series of vehicles, except as may be necessary to sell
6 or service the model or series of vehicles as provided
7 by subparagraph e of this paragraph. It shall be a
8 violation of this section for new vehicle allocation
9 to be withheld subject to any requirement to purchase
10 or sell any number of used or off-lease vehicles. The
11 failure to deliver any such new motor vehicle shall
12 not be considered a violation of the section if the
13 failure is not arbitrary or is due to lack of
14 manufacturing capacity or to a strike or labor
15 difficulty, a shortage of materials, a freight
16 embargo, or other cause over which the manufacturer
17 has no control. However, this subparagraph shall not
18 apply to recreational vehicles, limited production
19 model vehicles, a vehicle not advertised by the
20 factory for sale in this state, vehicles that are
21 subject to allocation affected by federal
22 environmental laws or environmental laws of this
23 state, or vehicles allocated in response to an
24 unforeseen event or circumstance,

1 e. except as necessary to comply with a health or safety
2 law, or to comply with a technology requirement which
3 is necessary to sell or service a motor vehicle that
4 the franchised new motor vehicle dealer is authorized
5 or licensed by the franchisor to sell or service,
6 requires a new motor vehicle dealer to construct a new
7 facility or substantially renovate the new motor
8 vehicle dealer's existing facility unless the facility
9 construction or renovation is justified by the
10 economic conditions existing at the time, as well as
11 the reasonably foreseeable projections, in the new
12 motor vehicle dealer's market and in the automotive
13 industry. However, this subparagraph shall not apply
14 if the new motor vehicle dealer voluntarily agrees to
15 facility construction or renovation in exchange for
16 money, credit, allowance, reimbursement, or additional
17 vehicle allocation to a new motor vehicle dealer from
18 the factory to compensate the new motor vehicle dealer
19 for the cost of, or a portion of the cost of, the
20 facility construction or renovation. Except as
21 necessary to comply with a health or safety law, or to
22 comply with a technology or safety requirement which
23 is necessary to sell or service a motor vehicle that
24 the franchised new motor vehicle dealer is authorized

1 or licensed by the franchisor to sell or service, a
2 new motor vehicle dealer which completes a facility
3 construction or renovation pursuant to factory
4 requirements shall not be required to construct a new
5 facility or renovate the existing facility if the same
6 area of the facility or premises has been constructed
7 or substantially altered within the last ten (10)
8 years and the construction or alteration was approved
9 by the manufacturer as a part of a facility upgrade
10 program, standard, or policy. For purposes of this
11 subparagraph, "substantially altered" means to perform
12 an alteration that substantially impacts the
13 architectural features, characteristics, or integrity
14 of a structure or lot. The term shall not include
15 routine maintenance reasonably necessary to maintain a
16 dealership in attractive condition. If a facility
17 upgrade program, standard, or policy under which the
18 dealer completed a facility construction or
19 substantial alteration does not contain a specific
20 time period during which the manufacturer or
21 distributor shall provide payments or benefits to a
22 participating dealer, or the time frame specified
23 under the program is reduced or canceled prematurely
24 in the unilateral discretion of the manufacturer or

1 distributor, the manufacturer or distributor shall not
2 deny the participating dealer any payment or benefit
3 under the terms of the program, standard, or policy as
4 it existed when the dealer began to perform under the
5 program, standard, or policy for the balance of the
6 ten-year period, regardless of whether the
7 manufacturer's or distributor's program, standard, or
8 policy has been changed or canceled, unless the
9 manufacturer and dealer agree, in writing, to the
10 change in payment or benefit. During the ten-year
11 period following facility construction or substantial
12 alteration, the manufacturer shall not fail to make
13 available to the dealer a fair and proportionate share
14 of all new vehicles distributed to dealers of the same
15 line-make in this state, subject to the same
16 reasonable terms, including vehicles distributed from
17 a common new vehicle inventory pool outside of the
18 factory's ordinary allocation process, such as any
19 vehicles the factory reserves to distribute on a
20 discretionary basis,
21 f. requires a new motor vehicle dealer to establish an
22 exclusive facility or to change the location of the
23 dealership, unless supported by reasonable business,
24 market, and economic considerations; provided, that
SENATE FLOOR VERSION - HB2158 SFLR Page 45

1 this section shall not restrict the terms of any
2 agreement for such exclusive facility voluntarily
3 entered into and supported by valuable consideration
4 separate from the new motor vehicle dealer's right to
5 sell and service motor vehicles for the franchisor.
6 If a dealer is required by the manufacturer or
7 distributor to change an existing, previously approved
8 location of the dealership and has not sold its
9 existing dealership facility and real estate within
10 the later of one hundred eighty (180) days of listing
11 the property for sale or ninety (90) days after the
12 facility relocation, then, upon the written request of
13 the dealer, the manufacturer or distributor shall
14 purchase the dealer's existing dealership facility and
15 real estate as if the new motor vehicle dealership
16 continues to operate on the property. If the factory
17 and dealer cannot agree on the value of the dealership
18 facilities and real estate, then the factory and
19 dealer shall utilize the process described in
20 paragraph 6 of subsection G of Section 565.2 of this
21 title. If a manufacturer or distributor purchases a
22 dealership facility and real estate, then it shall be
23 entitled to sole ownership, possession, use, and

7 terms of any site-control agreement voluntarily
8 entered into and supported by valuable consideration
9 separate from the new motor vehicle dealer's right to
10 sell and service motor vehicles for the franchisor.
11 Notwithstanding the foregoing or the terms of any
12 site-control agreement, a site-control agreement
13 automatically extinguishes if all of the factory's
14 franchises that operated from the location that are
15 the subject of the site-control agreement are
16 terminated by the factory as part of the
17 discontinuance of a product line,
18 h. refuses to pay, or claims reimbursement from, a new

23 violation of the policy of the factory unless the
24 factory can show that, at the time of the sale, the
SENATE FLOOR VERSION - HB2158 SFLR Page 47
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)

1 new motor vehicle dealer knew or reasonably should
2 have known of the purchaser's intention to export or
3 resell the motor vehicle. There is a rebuttable
4 presumption that the new motor vehicle dealer did not
5 know or could not have known that the vehicle would be
6 exported if the vehicle is titled and registered in
7 any state of the United States, or
8 i. (1) notwithstanding the terms of a franchise
9 agreement or other agreement except as provided
10 by this subsection, requires a new motor vehicle
11 dealer to purchase or utilize goods or services,
12 or contract with any vendor, identified, selected
13 or designated by the factory for the:
14 (a) operation of the dealership including
15 electronic services such as websites, data
16 management or storage systems, digital
17 retail platforms, software, or other digital
18 services or platforms, or
19 (b) construction, renovation, or improvement of
20 the new motor vehicle dealer's facility from
21 a vendor chosen by the factory if goods or
22 services available from other sources a
23 vendor that the new motor vehicle dealer
24 chooses, are of substantially similar

(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)

1 quality, function, and design, and comply
2 with all applicable laws; provided, however,
3 that such goods are not subject to the
4 factory's intellectual property or trademark
5 rights and the new motor vehicle dealer has
6 received the factory's approval, which
7 approval may not be unreasonably withheld.
8 Nothing in this subparagraph may be
9 construed to allow a new motor vehicle
10 dealer to impair or eliminate a factory's
11 intellectual property, trademark rights, or
12 trade dress usage guidelines. Nothing in
13 this section subdivision or subdivision a of
14 this division prohibits the enforcement of a
15 voluntary agreement between the factory and
16 the new motor vehicle dealer where separate
17 and valuable consideration has been offered
18 and accepted. It is a violation of this
19 subdivision or subdivision a of this
20 division for a factory, or any entity that
21 acts on behalf of, a factory to coerce a new
22 motor vehicle dealer to purchase or utilize
23 certain goods or services by the withholding

1 vehicle allocation the new motor vehicle
2 dealer is otherwise eligible to receive, and
3 (2) for the purposes of this subparagraph, "goods and
4 services" do not include:
5 (a) moveable displays, brochures, promotional
6 materials, or electronic or digital media
7 containing material subject to the
8 intellectual property rights of a factory or
9 parts to be used in repairs under warranty
10 obligations of a factory, or
11 (b) special tools or training required by the
12 factory to perform warranty or recall
13 repairs;
14 10. Being a factory that:
15 a. establishes a system of motor vehicle allocation or
16 distribution which is unfair, inequitable, or
17 unreasonably discriminatory. A manufacturer and
18 distributor shall maintain for three (3) years records
19 that describe its methods or formula of allocation and
20 distribution of its motor vehicles and records of its
21 actual allocation and distribution of motor vehicles
22 to its motor vehicle dealers. Upon the written
23 request of any new motor vehicle dealer franchised by
24 the manufacturer or distributor, received by the
SENATE FLOOR VERSION - HB2158 SFLR Page 50
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)

1 manufacturer or distributor within thirty (30) days of
2 the manufacturer's or distributor's written notice to
3 the dealer of its intention to cancel or terminate, or
4 written notice from the manufacturer or distributor of
5 a sales performance deficiency requiring the dealer to
6 take action to cure the alleged performance
7 deficiency, a manufacturer or distributor shall
8 disclose in writing to the new motor vehicle dealer
9 the basis upon which new motor vehicles are allocated,
10 scheduled, and delivered, by vehicle model, to new
11 motor vehicle dealers of the same line-make for that
12 manufacturer or distributor for the prior three (3)
13 years, and the basis upon which the current allocation
14 or distribution is being made or will be made based on
15 existing information to such dealer, or
16 b. changes an established plan or system of motor vehicle
17 distribution. A new motor vehicle dealer franchise
18 agreement shall continue in full force and operation
19 notwithstanding a change, in whole or in part, of an
20 established plan or system of distribution of the
21 motor vehicles offered or previously offered for sale
22 under the franchise agreement. The appointment of a
23 new importer or distributor for motor vehicles offered
24 for sale under the franchise agreement shall be deemed
SENATE FLOOR VERSION - HB2158 SFLR Page 51
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)

1 to be a change of an established plan or system of
2 distribution. The discontinuation of a line-make
3 shall not be deemed to be a change of an established
4 plan or system of motor vehicle distribution. The
5 creation of a line-make shall not be deemed to be a
6 change of an established plan or system of motor
7 vehicle distribution as long as the new line-make is
8 not selling the same, or substantially the same
9 vehicle or vehicles previously sold through another
10 line-make by new motor vehicle dealers with an active
11 franchise agreement for the other line-make in the
12 state if such new motor vehicle dealers are no longer
13 authorized to sell the comparable vehicle previously
14 sold through their line-make. Changing a vehicle's
15 powertrain is not sufficient to show it is
16 substantially different. Upon the occurrence of such
17 change, the manufacturer or distributor shall be
18 prohibited from obtaining a license to distribute
19 vehicles under the new plan or system of distribution
20 unless the manufacturer or distributor offers to each
21 new motor vehicle dealer who is a party to the
22 franchise agreement a new franchise agreement
23 containing substantially the same provisions which
24 were contained in the previous franchise agreement;

1 while in a bona fide relationship with a dealer
2 development candidate who has made a substantial
3 initial investment in the franchise and whose

5 The dealer development candidate can reasonably
6 expect to acquire full ownership of a new motor
7 vehicle dealer within a reasonable period of time
8 not to exceed ten (10) years and on reasonable
9 terms and conditions. The ten-year acquisition
10 period may be expanded for good cause shown.
11 (2) This paragraph does not prohibit a factory from
12 owning, operating, controlling, or acting in the
13 capacity of a new motor vehicle dealer for a

15 the transition from one independent dealer to
16 another independent dealer if the dealership is
17 for sale at a reasonable price and on reasonable
18 terms and conditions to an independent qualified
19 buyer. On showing by a factory of good cause,
20 the Oklahoma New Motor Vehicle Commission may
21 extend the time limit set forth above; extensions
22 may be granted for periods not to exceed twelve
23 (12) months.

8 controls motor vehicle dealerships of the same
9 line-make franchised by the manufacturer,
10 provided that each of the following conditions
