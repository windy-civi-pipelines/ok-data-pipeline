A Resolution recognizing and commending the National
Conference of State Legislatures on its 50th
anniversary in 2025; and directing distribution.
WHEREAS, the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL)
was founded in 1975 and has evolved during the past half-century to
become the premier organization solely dedicated to serving state
and territorial legislators and legislative staff; and
WHEREAS, it was created from the merger of three organizations
that served or represented state legislatures and that shared the
belief that legislative service is one of democracy’s worthiest
pursuits; and
WHEREAS, NCSL is a bipartisan organization with three
objectives: to advance the effectiveness, independence, and
integrity of state legislatures; to foster interstate communication
and cooperation; and to ensure states have a strong, cohesive voice
in the federal system; and

WHEREAS, our nation’s state legislatures are America’s
laboratories of democracy and have continually shown that they are
the bodies to tackle emerging challenges. State legislatures are
where people from very different backgrounds, representing very
different communities, can come together and find common ground.
NCSL has facilitated the exchange of ideas, provided critical
research and information, and encouraged a rigorous review of
complex issues confronting our communities, states, and nation.
NCSL strives to strengthen the bonds between America’s state
legislatures and the international community.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE OF THE 1ST SESSION
OF THE 60TH OKLAHOMA LEGISLATURE:
THAT the Oklahoma State Senate recognizes and commends the
National Conference of State Legislatures for its superb leadership
and its commitment to the legislative institution.
THAT a copy of this resolution be distributed to the National
Conference of State Legislatures.
Adopted by the Senate the 23rd day of April, 2025.
