1 b. For all taxable years beginning on or after January 1,
2 2026, qualifying corporations may elect to use a
3 single sales factor apportionment comprising sales as
4 one hundred percent (100%) of the apportionment or the
5 corporation may elect to compute Oklahoma taxable
6 income using the apportionment methodology in which
7 each of the three factors in subparagraph d of this
8 paragraph is equally weighted and an arithmetical
9 average of the three factors is determined as
10 otherwise provided by this paragraph. A qualifying
11 corporation is one whose property for purposes of the
12 tax imposed by Section 2355 of this title has an
13 initial cumulative investment cost equaling or

9 expenditures is commenced on or after January 1, 2000,
10 the three factors shall be apportioned with property
11 and payroll, each comprising twenty-five percent (25%)
12 of the apportionment factor and sales comprising fifty
13 percent (50%) of the apportionment factor January 1,
14 2018. The As used in this subparagraph, investments,
15 improvements, or expenditures shall include but not be
16 limited to:
17 (1) expenditures for intangible drilling costs, as
18 defined in Internal Revenue Code Section 263(c),

9 on or after January 1, 2026, Oklahoma taxable income
10 shall be computed using a single sales factor
11 comprising one hundred percent (100%) of the
12 apportionment and the corporation shall not use an
13 arithmetic average of the three factors consisting of
14 property, payroll, and sales. For the applicable tax
15 years, the apportionment factors shall be computed as
16 follows and for corporations required to use the
17 single sales factor the provisions of subparagraph d
18 of this paragraph shall be used to determine Oklahoma
19 taxable income as provided therein.
20 d. For corporations required or electing to use a single
21 sales factor apportionment, the provisions of division
22 (3) of this subparagraph shall be used to determine
23 Oklahoma taxable income as provided therein. For the
24 applicable tax years, or for qualifying corporations
Req. No. 10189 Page 13

1 electing the three-factor apportionment, the
2 apportionment factors shall be computed as follows:
3 a.
4 (1) The property factor is a fraction, the numerator
5 of which is the average value of the taxpayer's
6 real and tangible personal property owned or
7 rented and used in this state during the tax
8 period and the denominator of which is the
9 average value of all the taxpayer's real and
10 tangible personal property everywhere owned or
11 rented and used during the tax period.
12 (1)
13 (a) Property, the income from which is
14 separately allocated in paragraph 4 of this
15 subsection, shall not be included in
16 determining this fraction. The numerator of
17 the fraction shall include a portion of the

19 equipment having no fixed situs, such as
20 rolling stock, buses, trucks and trailers,
21 including machinery and equipment carried
22 thereon, airplanes, salespersons'
23 automobiles and other similar equipment, in
24 the proportion that miles traveled in
Req. No. 10189 Page 14

1 Oklahoma by such equipment bears to total
2 miles traveled,
3 (2)
4 (b) Property owned by the taxpayer is valued at
5 its original cost. Property rented by the
6 taxpayer is valued at eight times the net
7 annual rental rate. Net annual rental rate
8 is the annual rental rate paid by the
9 taxpayer, less any annual rental rate
10 received by the taxpayer from subrentals,
11 (3)
12 (c) The average value of property shall be
13 determined by averaging the values at the
14 beginning and ending of the tax period but
15 the Oklahoma Tax Commission may require the
16 averaging of monthly values during the tax
17 period if reasonably required to reflect
18 properly the average value of the taxpayer's
19 property;
20 b.
21 (2) The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator
22 of which is the total compensation for services
23 rendered in the state during the tax period, and
24 the denominator of which is the total
Req. No. 10189 Page 15

1 compensation for services rendered everywhere
2 during the tax period. "Compensation", as used
3 in this subsection division means those paid-for
4 services to the extent related to the unitary
5 business but does not include officers' salaries,
6 wages and other compensation.
7 (1)
8 (a) In the case of a transportation enterprise,
9 the numerator of the fraction shall include
10 a portion of such expenditure in connection
11 with employees operating equipment over a
12 fixed route, such as railroad employees,
13 airline pilots, or bus drivers, in this
14 state only a part of the time, in the
15 proportion that mileage traveled in Oklahoma
16 bears to total mileage traveled by such
17 employees,
18 (2)
19 (b) In any case the numerator of the fraction
20 shall include a portion of such expenditures
21 in connection with itinerant employees, such
22 as traveling salespersons, in this state
23 only a part of the time, in the proportion
24 that time spent in Oklahoma bears to total
Req. No. 10189 Page 16

1 time spent in furtherance of the enterprise
2 by such employees;
3 c.
4 (3) The sales factor is a fraction, the numerator of
5 which is the total sales or gross revenue of the
6 taxpayer in this state during the tax period, and
7 the denominator of which is the total sales or
8 gross revenue of the taxpayer everywhere during
9 the tax period. "Sales", as used in this
10 subsection division does not include sales or
11 gross revenue which are separately allocated in
12 paragraph 4 of this subsection.
13 (1)
14 (a) Sales of tangible personal property have a
15 situs in this state if the property is
16 delivered or shipped to a purchaser other
17 than the United States government, within
18 this state regardless of the FOB point or
19 other conditions of the sale; or the
20 property is shipped from an office, store,
21 warehouse, factory or other place of storage
22 in this state and (a) the purchaser is the
23 United States government or (b) the taxpayer

Req. No. 10189 Page 17

1 is not doing business in the state of the
2 destination of the shipment.
3 (2)
4 (b) In the case of a railroad or interurban
5 railway enterprise, the numerator of the
6 fraction shall not be less than the
7 allocation of revenues to this state as
8 shown in its annual report to the
9 Corporation Commission.
10 (3)
11 (c) In the case of an airline, truck or bus
12 enterprise or freight car, tank car,
13 refrigerator car or other railroad equipment
14 enterprise, the numerator of the fraction
15 shall include a portion of revenue from
16 interstate transportation in the proportion
17 that interstate mileage traveled in Oklahoma
18 bears to total interstate mileage traveled.
19 (4)
20 (d) In the case of an oil, gasoline or gas
21 pipeline enterprise, the numerator of the
22 fraction shall be either the total of
23 traffic units of the enterprise within
24 Oklahoma or the revenue allocated to
Req. No. 10189 Page 18

1 Oklahoma based upon miles moved, at the
2 option of the taxpayer, and the denominator
3 of which shall be the total of traffic units
4 of the enterprise or the revenue of the
5 enterprise everywhere as appropriate to the
6 numerator. A "traffic unit" is hereby
7 defined as the transportation for a distance
8 of one (1) mile of one (1) barrel of oil,
9 one (1) gallon of gasoline or one thousand
10 (1,000) cubic feet of natural or casinghead
11 gas, as the case may be.
12 (5)
13 (e) In the case of a telephone or telegraph or
14 other communication enterprise, the
15 numerator of the fraction shall include that
16 portion of the interstate revenue as is
17 allocated pursuant to the accounting
18 procedures prescribed by the Federal
19 Communications Commission; provided that in
20 respect to each corporation or business
21 entity required by the Federal
22 Communications Commission to keep its books
23 and records in accordance with a uniform
24 system of accounts prescribed by such
Req. No. 10189 Page 19

1 Commission, the intrastate net income shall
2 be determined separately in the manner
3 provided by such uniform system of accounts
4 and only the interstate income shall be
5 subject to allocation pursuant to the
6 provisions of this paragraph 4 of this
7 subsection. Provided further, that the
8 gross revenue factors shall be those as are
9 determined pursuant to the accounting
10 procedures prescribed by the Federal
11 Communications Commission.
12 In any case where the apportionment of the three factors
13 prescribed in this paragraph division (1), (2), or (3) of this
14 subparagraph attributes to Oklahoma a portion of net income of the
15 enterprise out of all appropriate proportion to the property owned
16 and/or business transacted within this state, because of the fact
17 that one or more of the factors so prescribed are not employed to
18 any appreciable extent in furtherance of the enterprise; or because
19 one or more factors not so prescribed are employed to a considerable
20 extent in furtherance of the enterprise; or because of other
21 reasons, the Tax Commission is empowered to permit, after a showing
22 by taxpayer that an excessive portion of net income has been
23 attributed to Oklahoma, or require, when in its judgment an
24 insufficient portion of net income has been attributed to Oklahoma,
Req. No. 10189 Page 20

1 the elimination, substitution, or use of additional factors, or
2 reduction or increase in the weight of such prescribed factors.
3 Provided, however, that any such variance from such prescribed
4 factors which has the effect of increasing the portion of net income
5 attributable to Oklahoma must not be inherently arbitrary, and
6 application of the recomputed final apportionment to the net income
7 of the enterprise must attribute to Oklahoma only a reasonable
8 portion thereof.
9 6. For calendar years 1997 and 1998, the owner of a new or
10 expanded agricultural commodity processing facility in this state
11 may exclude from Oklahoma taxable income, or in the case of an
12 individual, the Oklahoma adjusted gross income, fifteen percent
13 (15%) of the investment by the owner in the new or expanded
14 agricultural commodity processing facility. For calendar year 1999,
15 and all subsequent years, the percentage, not to exceed fifteen
16 percent (15%), available to the owner of a new or expanded
17 agricultural commodity processing facility in this state claiming
18 the exemption shall be adjusted annually so that the total estimated
19 reduction in tax liability does not exceed One Million Dollars
20 ($1,000,000.00) annually. The Tax Commission shall promulgate rules
21 for determining the percentage of the investment which each eligible
22 taxpayer may exclude. The exclusion provided by this paragraph
23 shall be taken in the taxable year when the investment is made. In
24 the event the total reduction in tax liability authorized by this
Req. No. 10189 Page 21

1 para graph exceeds One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) in any
2 calendar year, the Tax Commission shall permit any excess over One
3 Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) and shall factor such excess into
4 the percentage for subsequent years. Any amount of the exemption
5 permitted to be excluded pursuant to the provisions of this
6 paragraph but not used in any year may be carried forward as an
7 exemption from income pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph
8 for a period not exceeding six (6) years following the year in which
9 the investment was originally made.
10 For purposes of this paragraph:
11 a. "Agricultural commodity processing facility" means
12 building, structures, fixtures and improvements used
13 or operated primarily for the processing or production
14 of marketable products from agricultural commodities.
15 The term shall also mean a dairy operation that
16 requires a depreciable investment of at least Two
17 Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($250,000.00) and which
18 produces milk from dairy cows. The term does not
19 include a facility that provides only, and nothing
20 more than, storage, cleaning, drying or transportation
21 of agricultural commodities, and
22 b. "Facility" means each part of the facility which is
23 used in a process primarily for:
24
Req. No. 10189 Page 22

1 (1) the processing of agricultural commodities,

5 (2) transporting the agricultural commodities or
6 product before, during or after the processing,
7 or
8 (3) packaging or otherwise preparing the product for
9 sale or shipment.
10 7. Despite any provision to the contrary in paragraph 3 of this
11 subsection, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1999, in

13 shall be considered a net operating loss carryback in accordance
14 with and to the extent of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C.,
15 Section 172(b)(G). However, the amount of the net operating loss
16 carryback shall not exceed the lesser of:
17 a. Sixty Thousand Dollars ($60,000.00), or
18 b. the loss properly shown on Schedule F of the Internal
19 Revenue Service Form 1040 reduced by one-half (1/2) of
20 the income from all other sources other than reflected
21 on Schedule F.
22 8. In taxable years beginning after December 31, 1995, all
23 qualified wages equal to the federal income tax credit set forth in
24 26 U.S.C.A., Section 45A, shall be deducted from taxable income.
Req. No. 10189 Page 23

1 The deduction allowed pursuant to this paragraph shall only be
