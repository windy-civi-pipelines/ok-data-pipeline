3 adjusted gross income for individuals, as follows:
4 1. There shall be added interest income on obligations of any
5 state or political subdivision thereto which is not otherwise
6 exempted pursuant to other laws of this state, to the extent that
7 such interest is not included in taxable income and adjusted gross
8 income.

13 3. The amount of any federal net operating loss deduction shall
14 be adjusted as follows:
15 a. For carryovers and carrybacks to taxable years
16 beginning before January 1, 1981, the amount of any
17 net operating loss deduction allowed to a taxpayer for

1 b. For carryovers and carrybacks to taxable years
2 beginning after December 31, 1980, the amount of any
3 net operating loss deduction allowed for the taxable
4 year shall be an amount equal to the aggregate of the

8 indicated. Allowable deductions attributable to items separately
9 allocable in subparagraphs a, b and c of this paragraph, whether or

22 (1) where such property has acquired a nonunitary
23 business or commercial situs apart from the
24 domicile of the taxpayer such income shall be
HB1200 HFLR Page 4
BOLD FACE denotes Committee Amendments.

1 allocated in accordance with such business or
2 commercial situs; interest income from
3 investments held to generate working capital for
4 a unitary business enterprise shall be included
5 in apportionable income; a resident trust or
6 resident estate shall be treated as having a
7 separate commercial or business situs insofar as
8 undistributed income is concerned, but shall not
9 be treated as having a separate commercial or
10 business situs insofar as distributed income is
11 concerned,
12 (2) for taxable years beginning after December 31,
13 2003, capital or ordinary gains or losses from
14 the sale of an ownership interest in a publicly
15 traded partnership, as defined by Section 7704(b)
16 of the Internal Revenue Code, shall be allocated
17 to this state in the ratio of the original cost
18 of such partnership's tangible property in this
19 state to the original cost of such partnership's
20 tangible property everywhere, as determined at
21 the time of the sale; if more than fifty percent
22 (50%) of the value of the partnership's assets
23 consists of intangible assets, capital or

1 ownership interest in the partnership shall be
2 allocated to this state in accordance with the
3 sales factor of the partnership for its first
4 full tax period immediately preceding its tax
5 period during which the ownership interest in the
6 partnership was sold; the provisions of this
7 division shall only apply if the capital or
8 ordinary gains or losses from the sale of an
9 ownership interest in a partnership do not
10 constitute qualifying gain receiving capital
11 treatment as defined in subparagraph a of

11 within the state where the shipment to such
12 warehouses is not covered by "in transit"
13 tariffs, as prescribed and allowed by the
14 Interstate Commerce Commission, to a purchaser
15 within or without the state,
16 the Oklahoma net income shall, at the option of the
17 taxpayer, be that portion of the total net income of
18 the taxpayer for federal income tax purposes derived
19 from the manufacture and/or processing and sales
20 everywhere as determined by the ratio of the sales
21 defined in this section made to the purchaser within
22 the state to the total sales everywhere. The term

8 (1) except as otherwise provided by division (2) of
9 this subparagraph, taxable income of an insurance
10 company for a taxable year shall be apportioned
11 to this state by multiplying such income by a
12 fraction, the numerator of which is the direct

BOLD FACE denotes Committee Amendments.

1 Commissioners, or such other form as may be
2 prescribed in lieu thereof,
3 (2) if the principal source of premiums written by an
4 insurance company consists of premiums for
5 reinsurance accepted by it, the taxable income of
6 such company shall be apportioned to this state
7 by multiplying such income by a fraction, the
8 numerator of which is the sum of (a) direct
9 premiums written for insurance on property or
10 risks in this state, plus (b) premiums written
11 for reinsurance accepted in respect of property
12 or risks in this state, and the denominator of
13 which is the sum of (c) direct premiums written

17 everywhere. For purposes of this paragraph,
18 premiums written for reinsurance accepted in
19 respect of property or risks in this state,
20 whether or not otherwise determinable, may at the

23 for insurance accepted from companies
24 commercially domiciled in Oklahoma bears to
HB1200 HFLR Page 9
BOLD FACE denotes Committee Amendments.

1 premiums written for reinsurance accepted from
2 all sources, or alternatively in the proportion
3 which the sum of the direct premiums written for
4 insurance on property or risks in this state by
5 each ceding company from which reinsurance is
6 accepted bears to the sum of the total direct
7 premiums written by each such ceding company for
8 the taxable year.
9 5. The a. Except as otherwise provided by subparagraph b or c
10 of this paragraph, for taxable years beginning not
11 later than December 31, 2025, the net income or loss
12 remaining after the separate allocation in paragraph 4
13 of this subsection, being that which is derived from a
14 unitary business enterprise, shall be apportioned to
15 this state on the basis of the arithmetical average of
16 three factors consisting of property, payroll and
17 sales or gross revenue enumerated as subparagraphs a,
18 b and c of this paragraph divisions (1), (2), and (3)
19 of subparagraph d of this paragraph. Net income or
20 loss as used in this paragraph includes that derived
21 from patent or copyright royalties, purchase
22 discounts, and interest on accounts receivable

1 subsection, including the sale or other disposition of
2 such property and any other property used in the
3 unitary enterprise. Deductions used in computing such
4 net income or loss shall not include taxes based on or
5 measured by income. Provided, for
6 b. For all taxable years beginning on or after January 1,
7 2026, qualifying corporations may elect to use a
8 single sales factor apportionment comprising sales as
9 one hundred percent (100%) of the apportionment or the
10 corporation may elect to compute Oklahoma taxable
11 income using the apportionment methodology in which
12 each of the three factors in subparagraph d of this
13 paragraph is equally weighted and an arithmetical
14 average of the three factors is determined as
15 otherwise provided by this paragraph. A qualifying
16 corporation is one whose property for purposes of the
17 tax imposed by Section 2355 of this title has an
18 initial cumulative investment cost equaling or
19 exceeding Two Hundred Million Dollars
20 ($200,000,000.00) One Hundred Million Dollars
21 ($100,000,000.00) over three (3) years and such
22 investment is made on or after July 1, 1997 January 1,
23 2018, or for corporations a corporation which expand
24 expands their property or facilities or which makes

BOLD FACE denotes Committee Amendments.

1 improvements or upgrades or any combination of such
2 expenditures which shall be valued at the original
3 costs, prior to federal adjustments, at the time of
4 acquisition by the corporation and adjusted by
5 subsequent capital additions or improvements thereto
6 and partial disposition thereof, by reason of sale,
7 exchange, or abandonment, in this state and such
8 expansion has, improvements, upgrades, or expenditures
9 have an investment cost equaling or exceeding Two
10 Hundred Million Dollars ($200,000,000.00) One Hundred
11 Million Dollars ($100,000,000.00) over a period not to
12 exceed three (3) years, and such expansion,
13 improvements, upgrades, or any combination of such
14 expenditures is commenced on or after January 1, 2000,
15 the three factors shall be apportioned with property
16 and payroll, each comprising twenty-five percent (25%)
17 of the apportionment factor and sales comprising fifty
18 percent (50%) of the apportionment factor January 1,
19 2018. The As used in this subparagraph, investments,
20 improvements, or expenditures shall include but not be
21 limited to:
22 (1) expenditures for intangible drilling costs, as
23 defined in Internal Revenue Code Section 263(c),
24 without regard to whether such intangible
HB1200 HFLR Page 12
BOLD FACE denotes Committee Amendments.

1 drilling costs are capitalized or expensed for
2 federal income tax purposes,
3 (2) track structure expenditures, as defined in
4 Internal Revenue Procedure 2001-46, without
5 regard to whether such track costs are
6 capitalized or expensed for federal income tax
7 purposes, and
8 (3) property received in a transaction that qualifies
9 as an Internal Revenue Code Section 332
10 liquidation; the investment period for such
11 property shall be the original investment period
12 of the liquidating corporation.
13 c. For any other corporation, for taxable years beginning
14 on or after January 1, 2026, Oklahoma taxable income
15 shall be computed using a single sales factor
16 comprising one hundred percent (100%) of the
17 apportionment and the corporation shall not use an
18 arithmetic average of the three factors consisting of
19 property, payroll, and sales. For the applicable tax
20 years, the apportionment factors shall be computed as
21 follows and for corporations required to use the
22 single sales factor the provisions of subparagraph d
23 of this paragraph shall be used to determine Oklahoma
24 taxable income as provided therein.
HB1200 HFLR Page 13
BOLD FACE denotes Committee Amendments.

1 d. For corporations required or electing to use a single
2 sales factor apportionment, the provisions of division
3 (3) of this subparagraph shall be used to determine
4 Oklahoma taxable income as provided therein. For the
5 applicable tax years, or for qualifying corporations
6 electing the three-factor apportionment, the
7 apportionment factors shall be computed as follows:
8 a.
9 (1) The property factor is a fraction, the numerator
10 of which is the average value of the taxpayer's
11 real and tangible personal property owned or
12 rented and used in this state during the tax
13 period and the denominator of which is the
14 average value of all the taxpayer's real and
15 tangible personal property everywhere owned or
16 rented and used during the tax period.
17 (1)
18 (a) Property, the income from which is
19 separately allocated in paragraph 4 of this
20 subsection, shall not be included in
21 determining this fraction. The numerator of
22 the fraction shall include a portion of the
23 investment in transportation and other
24 equipment having no fixed situs, such as
HB1200 HFLR Page 14
BOLD FACE denotes Committee Amendments.

1 rolling stock, buses, trucks and trailers,
2 including machinery and equipment carried
3 thereon, airplanes, salespersons'
4 automobiles and other similar equipment, in
5 the proportion that miles traveled in
6 Oklahoma by such equipment bears to total
7 miles traveled,
8 (2)
9 (b) Property owned by the taxpayer is valued at
10 its original cost. Property rented by the
11 taxpayer is valued at eight times the net
12 annual rental rate. Net annual rental rate
13 is the annual rental rate paid by the
14 taxpayer, less any annual rental rate
15 received by the taxpayer from subrentals,
16 (3)
17 (c) The average value of property shall be
18 determined by averaging the values at the
19 beginning and ending of the tax period but
20 the Oklahoma Tax Commission may require the
21 averaging of monthly values during the tax
22 period if reasonably required to reflect
23 properly the average value of the taxpayer's
24 property;
HB1200 HFLR Page 15
BOLD FACE denotes Committee Amendments.

1 b.
2 (2) The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator
3 of which is the total compensation for services
4 rendered in the state during the tax period, and
5 the denominator of which is the total
6 compensation for services rendered everywhere
7 during the tax period. "Compensation", as used
8 in this subsection division means those paid-for
9 services to the extent related to the unitary
10 business but does not include officers' salaries,
11 wages and other compensation.
12 (1)
13 (a) In the case of a transportation enterprise,
14 the numerator of the fraction shall include
15 a portion of such expenditure in connection
16 with employees operating equipment over a
17 fixed route, such as railroad employees,
18 airline pilots, or bus drivers, in this
19 state only a part of the time, in the
20 proportion that mileage traveled in Oklahoma
21 bears to total mileage traveled by such
22 employees,
23 (2)
24
HB1200 HFLR Page 16
BOLD FACE denotes Committee Amendments.

1 (b) In any case the numerator of the fraction
2 shall include a portion of such expenditures
3 in connection with itinerant employees, such
4 as traveling salespersons, in this state
5 only a part of the time, in the proportion
6 that time spent in Oklahoma bears to total
7 time spent in furtherance of the enterprise
8 by such employees;
9 c.
10 (3) The sales factor is a fraction, the numerator of
11 which is the total sales or gross revenue of the
12 taxpayer in this state during the tax period, and
13 the denominator of which is the total sales or
14 gross revenue of the taxpayer everywhere during
15 the tax period. "Sales", as used in this
16 subsection division does not include sales or
17 gross revenue which are separately allocated in
18 paragraph 4 of this subsection.
19 (1)
20 (a) Sales of tangible personal property have a
21 situs in this state if the property is
22 delivered or shipped to a purchaser other
23 than the United States government, within
24 this state regardless of the FOB point or
HB1200 HFLR Page 17
BOLD FACE denotes Committee Amendments.

1 other conditions of the sale; or the
2 property is shipped from an office, store,
3 warehouse, factory or other place of storage
4 in this state and (a) the purchaser is the
5 United States government or (b) the taxpayer
6 is not doing business in the state of the
7 destination of the shipment.
8 (2)
9 (b) In the case of a railroad or interurban
10 railway enterprise, the numerator of the
11 fraction shall not be less than the
12 allocation of revenues to this state as
13 shown in its annual report to the
14 Corporation Commission.
15 (3)
16 (c) In the case of an airline, truck or bus
17 enterprise or freight car, tank car,
18 refrigerator car or other railroad equipment
19 enterprise, the numerator of the fraction
20 shall include a portion of revenue from
21 interstate transportation in the proportion
22 that interstate mileage traveled in Oklahoma
23 bears to total interstate mileage traveled.
24 (4)
HB1200 HFLR Page 18
BOLD FACE denotes Committee Amendments.

1 (d) In the case of an oil, gasoline or gas
2 pipeline enterprise, the numerator of the
3 fraction shall be either the total of
4 traffic units of the enterprise within
5 Oklahoma or the revenue allocated to
6 Oklahoma based upon miles moved, at the
7 option of the taxpayer, and the denominator
8 of which shall be the total of traffic units
9 of the enterprise or the revenue of the
10 enterprise everywhere as appropriate to the
11 numerator. A "traffic unit" is hereby
12 defined as the transportation for a distance
13 of one (1) mile of one (1) barrel of oil,
14 one (1) gallon of gasoline or one thousand
15 (1,000) cubic feet of natural or casinghead
16 gas, as the case may be.
17 (5)
18 (e) In the case of a telephone or telegraph or
19 other communication enterprise, the
20 numerator of the fraction shall include that
21 portion of the interstate revenue as is
22 allocated pursuant to the accounting
23 procedures prescribed by the Federal
24 Communications Commission; provided that in
HB1200 HFLR Page 19
BOLD FACE denotes Committee Amendments.

1 respect to each corporation or business
2 entity required by the Federal
3 Communications Commission to keep its books
4 and records in accordance with a uniform
5 system of accounts prescribed by such
6 Commission, the intrastate net income shall
7 be determined separately in the manner
8 provided by such uniform system of accounts
9 and only the interstate income shall be
10 subject to allocation pursuant to the
11 provisions of this paragraph 4 of this
12 subsection. Provided further, that the
13 gross revenue factors shall be those as are
14 determined pursuant to the accounting
15 procedures prescribed by the Federal
16 Communications Commission.
17 In any case where the apportionment of the three factors
18 prescribed in this paragraph division (1), (2), or (3) of this
19 subparagraph attributes to Oklahoma a portion of net income of the
20 enterprise out of all appropriate proportion to the property owned
21 and/or business transacted within this state, because of the fact
22 that one or more of the factors so prescribed are not employed to
23 any appreciable extent in furtherance of the enterprise; or because
24 one or more factors not so prescribed are employed to a considerable
HB1200 HFLR Page 20
BOLD FACE denotes Committee Amendments.

1 exte nt in furtherance of the enterprise; or because of other
2 reasons, the Tax Commission is empowered to permit, after a showing
3 by taxpayer that an excessive portion of net income has been
4 attributed to Oklahoma, or require, when in its judgment an
5 insufficient portion of net income has been attributed to Oklahoma,
6 the elimination, substitution, or use of additional factors, or
7 reduction or increase in the weight of such prescribed factors.
8 Provided, however, that any such variance from such prescribed
9 factors which has the effect of increasing the portion of net income
10 attributable to Oklahoma must not be inherently arbitrary, and
11 application of the recomputed final apportionment to the net income
12 of the enterprise must attribute to Oklahoma only a reasonable
13 portion thereof.
14 6. For calendar years 1997 and 1998, the owner of a new or
15 expanded agricultural commodity processing facility in this state
16 may exclude from Oklahoma taxable income, or in the case of an
17 individual, the Oklahoma adjusted gross income, fifteen percent
18 (15%) of the investment by the owner in the new or expanded
19 agricultural commodity processing facility. For calendar year 1999,
20 and all subsequent years, the percentage, not to exceed fifteen
21 percent (15%), available to the owner of a new or expanded
22 agricultural commodity processing facility in this state claiming
23 the exemption shall be adjusted annually so that the total estimated
24 reduction in tax liability does not exceed One Million Dollars
HB1200 HFLR Page 21
BOLD FACE denotes Committee Amendments.

1 ($1, 000,000.00) annually. The Tax Commission shall promulgate rules
2 for determining the percentage of the investment which each eligible
3 taxpayer may exclude. The exclusion provided by this paragraph
4 shall be taken in the taxable year when the investment is made. In
5 the event the total reduction in tax liability authorized by this
6 paragraph exceeds One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) in any
7 calendar year, the Tax Commission shall permit any excess over One
8 Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) and shall factor such excess into
9 the percentage for subsequent years. Any amount of the exemption
10 permitted to be excluded pursuant to the provisions of this
11 paragraph but not used in any year may be carried forward as an
12 exemption from income pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph
13 for a period not exceeding six (6) years following the year in which
14 the investment was originally made.
15 For purposes of this paragraph:
16 a. "Agricultural commodity processing facility" means
17 building, structures, fixtures and improvements used
18 or operated primarily for the processing or production
19 of marketable products from agricultural commodities.
20 The term shall also mean a dairy operation that
21 requires a depreciable investment of at least Two
22 Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($250,000.00) and which
23 produces milk from dairy cows. The term does not
24 include a facility that provides only, and nothing
HB1200 HFLR Page 22

1 more than, storage, cleaning, drying or transportation
2 of agricultural commodities, and
3 b. "Facility" means each part of the facility which is
4 used in a process primarily for:
5 (1) the processing of agricultural commodities,
6 including receiving or storing agricultural
7 commodities, or the production of milk at a dairy
8 operation,
9 (2) transporting the agricultural commodities or
10 product before, during or after the processing,
11 or
12 (3) packaging or otherwise preparing the product for
13 sale or shipment.
14 7. Despite any provision to the contrary in paragraph 3 of this
15 subsection, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1999, in
16 the case of a taxpayer which has a farming loss, such farming loss
17 shall be considered a net operating loss carryback in accordance
18 with and to the extent of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C.,
19 Section 172(b)(G). However, the amount of the net operating loss
20 carryback shall not exceed the lesser of:
21 a. Sixty Thousand Dollars ($60,000.00), or
22 b. the loss properly shown on Schedule F of the Internal
23 Revenue Service Form 1040 reduced by one-half (1/2) of

1 the income from all other sources other than reflected
2 on Schedule F.
