7 of Oklahoma.
8 3. The amount of any federal net operating loss deduction shall
9 be adjusted as follows:
10 a. For carryovers and carrybacks to taxable years
11 beginning before January 1, 1981, the amount of any
12 net operating loss deduction allowed to a taxpayer for
13 federal income tax purposes shall be reduced to an
14 amount which is the same portion thereof as the loss
15 from sources within this state, as determined pursuant
16 to this section and Section 2362 of this title, for
17 the taxable year in which such loss is sustained is of
18 the total loss for such year;
19 b. For carryovers and carrybacks to taxable years
20 beginning after December 31, 1980, the amount of any

19 back shall be determined solely by reference to
20 Section 172 of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C.,
21 Section 172, with the exception that the terms "net

17 business or commercial situs apart from the
18 domicile of the taxpayer such income shall be
19 allocated in accordance with such business or
20 commercial situs; interest income from
21 investments held to generate working capital for
22 a unitary business enterprise shall be included
23 in apportionable income; a resident trust or
24 resident estate shall be treated as having a
ENGR. H. B. NO. 1200 Page 4
1 separate commercial or business situs insofar as
2 undistributed income is concerned, but shall not
3 be treated as having a separate commercial or
4 business situs insofar as distributed income is
5 concerned,
6 (2) for taxable years beginning after December 31,
7 2003, capital or ordinary gains or losses from
8 the sale of an ownership interest in a publicly
9 traded partnership, as defined by Section 7704(b)
10 of the Internal Revenue Code, shall be allocated
11 to this state in the ratio of the original cost
12 of such partnership's tangible property in this
13 state to the original cost of such partnership's
14 tangible property everywhere, as determined at
15 the time of the sale; if more than fifty percent
16 (50%) of the value of the partnership's assets
17 consists of intangible assets, capital or
18 ordinary gains or losses from the sale of an
19 ownership interest in the partnership shall be
20 allocated to this state in accordance with the
21 sales factor of the partnership for its first
22 full tax period immediately preceding its tax
23 period during which the ownership interest in the
24 partnership was sold; the provisions of this
ENGR. H. B. NO. 1200 Page 5
1 division shall only apply if the capital or
2 ordinary gains or losses from the sale of an
3 ownership interest in a partnership do not
4 constitute qualifying gain receiving capital
5 treatment as defined in subparagraph a of
6 paragraph 2 of subsection F of this section,
7 (3) income from such property which is required to be

17 enterprise the business of which in Oklahoma consists
18 solely of marketing its products by:
19 (1) sales having a situs without this state, shipped
20 directly to a point from without the state to a
21 purchaser within the state, commonly known as
22 interstate sales,
23 (2) sales of the product stored in public warehouses
24 within the state pursuant to "in transit"
ENGR. H. B. NO. 1200 Page 6
1 tariffs, as prescribed and allowed by the
2 Interstate Commerce Commission, to a purchaser
3 within the state,
4 (3) sales of the product stored in public warehouses
5 within the state where the shipment to such
6 warehouses is not covered by "in transit"
7 tariffs, as prescribed and allowed by the
8 Interstate Commerce Commission, to a purchaser
9 within or without the state,
10 the Oklahoma net income shall, at the option of the
11 taxpayer, be that portion of the total net income of
12 the taxpayer for federal income tax purposes derived
13 from the manufacture and/or processing and sales
14 everywhere as determined by the ratio of the sales
15 defined in this section made to the purchaser within
16 the state to the total sales everywhere. The term
17 "public warehouse" as used in this subparagraph means
18 a licensed public warehouse, the principal business of
19 which is warehousing merchandise for the public;
20 e. In the case of insurance companies, Oklahoma taxable
21 income shall be taxable income of the taxpayer for
22 federal tax purposes, as adjusted for the adjustments

ENGR. H. B. NO. 1200 Page 7
1 (1) except as otherwise provided by division (2) of
2 this subparagraph, taxable income of an insurance
3 company for a taxable year shall be apportioned
4 to this state by multiplying such income by a
5 fraction, the numerator of which is the direct
6 premiums written for insurance on property or
7 risks in this state, and the denominator of which
8 is the direct premiums written for insurance on
9 property or risks everywhere. For purposes of
10 this subsection, the term "direct premiums
11 written" means the total amount of direct
12 premiums written, assessments and annuity
13 considerations as reported for the taxable year
14 on the annual statement filed by the company with
15 the Insurance Commissioner in the form approved
16 by the National Association of Insurance
17 Commissioners, or such other form as may be
18 prescribed in lieu thereof,
19 (2) if the principal source of premiums written by an
20 insurance company consists of premiums for
21 reinsurance accepted by it, the taxable income of
22 such company shall be apportioned to this state
23 by multiplying such income by a fraction, the
24 numerator of which is the sum of (a) direct
ENGR. H. B. NO. 1200 Page 8
1 premiums written for insurance on property or
2 risks in this state, plus (b) premiums written
3 for reinsurance accepted in respect of property
4 or risks in this state, and the denominator of
5 which is the sum of (c) direct premiums written
6 for insurance on property or risks everywhere,
7 plus (d) premiums written for reinsurance
8 accepted in respect of property or risks
9 everywhere. For purposes of this paragraph,
10 premiums written for reinsurance accepted in
11 respect of property or risks in this state,
12 whether or not otherwise determinable, may at the
13 election of the company be determined on the
14 basis of the proportion which premiums written
15 for insurance accepted from companies
16 commercially domiciled in Oklahoma bears to
17 premiums written for reinsurance accepted from
18 all sources, or alternatively in the proportion
19 which the sum of the direct premiums written for
20 insurance on property or risks in this state by
21 each ceding company from which reinsurance is
22 accepted bears to the sum of the total direct
23 premiums written by each such ceding company for
24 the taxable year.

1 5. The a. Except as otherwise provided by subparagraph b or c
2 of this paragraph, for taxable years beginning not
3 later than December 31, 2025, the net income or loss
4 remaining after the separate allocation in paragraph 4
5 of this subsection, being that which is derived from a
6 unitary business enterprise, shall be apportioned to
7 this state on the basis of the arithmetical average of
8 three factors consisting of property, payroll and
9 sales or gross revenue enumerated as subparagraphs a,
10 b and c of this paragraph divisions (1), (2), and (3)
11 of subparagraph d of this paragraph. Net income or
12 loss as used in this paragraph includes that derived
13 from patent or copyright royalties, purchase
14 discounts, and interest on accounts receivable
15 relating to or arising from a business activity, the
16 income from which is apportioned pursuant to this
17 subsection, including the sale or other disposition of
18 such property and any other property used in the
19 unitary enterprise. Deductions used in computing such
20 net income or loss shall not include taxes based on or
21 measured by income. Provided, for
22 b. For all taxable years beginning on or after January 1,
23 2026, qualifying corporations may elect to use a
24 single sales factor apportionment comprising sales as
ENGR. H. B. NO. 1200 Page 10
1 one hundred percent (100%) of the apportionment or the
2 corporation may elect to compute Oklahoma taxable
3 income using the apportionment methodology in which
4 each of the three factors in subparagraph d of this
5 paragraph is equally weighted and an arithmetical
6 average of the three factors is determined as
7 otherwise provided by this paragraph. A qualifying
8 corporation is one whose property for purposes of the
9 tax imposed by Section 2355 of this title has an
10 initial cumulative investment cost equaling or
11 exceeding Two Hundred Million Dollars
12 ($200,000,000.00) One Hundred Million Dollars
13 ($100,000,000.00) over three (3) years and such
14 investment is made on or after July 1, 1997 January 1,
15 2018, or for corporations a corporation which expand
16 expands their property or facilities or which makes
17 improvements or upgrades or any combination of such
18 expenditures which shall be valued at the original
19 costs, prior to federal adjustments, at the time of
20 acquisition by the corporation and adjusted by
21 subsequent capital additions or improvements thereto
22 and partial disposition thereof, by reason of sale,
23 exchange, or abandonment, in this state and such
24 expansion has, improvements, upgrades, or expenditures
ENGR. H. B. NO. 1200 Page 11
1 have an investment cost equaling or exceeding Two
2 Hundred Million Dollars ($200,000,000.00) One Hundred
3 Million Dollars ($100,000,000.00) over a period not to
4 exceed three (3) years, and such expansion,
5 improvements, upgrades, or any combination of such
6 expenditures is commenced on or after January 1, 2000,
7 the three factors shall be apportioned with property
8 and payroll, each comprising twenty-five percent (25%)
9 of the apportionment factor and sales comprising fifty
10 percent (50%) of the apportionment factor January 1,
11 2018. The As used in this subparagraph, investments,
12 improvements, or expenditures shall include but not be
13 limited to:
14 (1) expenditures for intangible drilling costs, as
15 defined in Internal Revenue Code Section 263(c),
16 without regard to whether such intangible
17 drilling costs are capitalized or expensed for
18 federal income tax purposes,
19 (2) track structure expenditures, as defined in
20 Internal Revenue Procedure 2001-46, without
21 regard to whether such track costs are
22 capitalized or expensed for federal income tax
23 purposes, and
24
ENGR. H. B. NO. 1200 Page 12
1 (3) property received in a transaction that qualifies
2 as an Internal Revenue Code Section 332
3 liquidation; the investment period for such
4 property shall be the original investment period
5 of the liquidating corporation.
6 c. For any other corporation, for taxable years beginning
7 on or after January 1, 2026, Oklahoma taxable income
8 shall be computed using a single sales factor
9 comprising one hundred percent (100%) of the
10 apportionment and the corporation shall not use an
11 arithmetic average of the three factors consisting of
12 property, payroll, and sales. For the applicable tax
13 years, the apportionment factors shall be computed as
14 follows and for corporations required to use the
15 single sales factor the provisions of subparagraph d
16 of this paragraph shall be used to determine Oklahoma
17 taxable income as provided therein.
18 d. For corporations required or electing to use a single
19 sales factor apportionment, the provisions of division
20 (3) of this subparagraph shall be used to determine
21 Oklahoma taxable income as provided therein. For the
22 applicable tax years, or for qualifying corporations
23 electing the three-factor apportionment, the
24 apportionment factors shall be computed as follows:
ENGR. H. B. NO. 1200 Page 13
1 a.
2 (1) The property factor is a fraction, the numerator
3 of which is the average value of the taxpayer's
4 real and tangible personal property owned or
5 rented and used in this state during the tax
6 period and the denominator of which is the
7 average value of all the taxpayer's real and
8 tangible personal property everywhere owned or
9 rented and used during the tax period.
10 (1)
11 (a) Property, the income from which is
12 separately allocated in paragraph 4 of this
13 subsection, shall not be included in
14 determining this fraction. The numerator of
15 the fraction shall include a portion of the
16 investment in transportation and other
17 equipment having no fixed situs, such as
18 rolling stock, buses, trucks and trailers,
19 including machinery and equipment carried
20 thereon, airplanes, salespersons'
21 automobiles and other similar equipment, in
22 the proportion that miles traveled in
23 Oklahoma by such equipment bears to total
24 miles traveled,.
ENGR. H. B. NO. 1200 Page 14
1 (2)
2 (b) Property owned by the taxpayer is valued at
3 its original cost. Property rented by the
4 taxpayer is valued at eight times the net
5 annual rental rate. Net annual rental rate
6 is the annual rental rate paid by the
7 taxpayer, less any annual rental rate
8 received by the taxpayer from subrentals,.
9 (3)
10 (c) The average value of property shall be
11 determined by averaging the values at the
12 beginning and ending of the tax period but
13 the Oklahoma Tax Commission may require the
14 averaging of monthly values during the tax
15 period if reasonably required to reflect
16 properly the average value of the taxpayer's
17 property;.
18 b.
19 (2) The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator
20 of which is the total compensation for services
21 rendered in the state during the tax period, and
22 the denominator of which is the total
23 compensation for services rendered everywhere
24 during the tax period. "Compensation", as used
ENGR. H. B. NO. 1200 Page 15
1 in this subsection division means those paid-for
2 services to the extent related to the unitary
3 business but does not include officers' salaries,
4 wages and other compensation.
5 (1)
6 (a) In the case of a transportation enterprise,
7 the numerator of the fraction shall include
8 a portion of such expenditure in connection
9 with employees operating equipment over a
10 fixed route, such as railroad employees,
11 airline pilots, or bus drivers, in this
12 state only a part of the time, in the
13 proportion that mileage traveled in Oklahoma
14 bears to total mileage traveled by such
15 employees,.
16 (2)
17 (b) In any case the numerator of the fraction
18 shall include a portion of such expenditures
19 in connection with itinerant employees, such
20 as traveling salespersons, in this state
21 only a part of the time, in the proportion
22 that time spent in Oklahoma bears to total
23 time spent in furtherance of the enterprise
24 by such employees;.
ENGR. H. B. NO. 1200 Page 16
1 c.
2 (3) The sales factor is a fraction, the numerator of
3 which is the total sales or gross revenue of the
4 taxpayer in this state during the tax period, and
5 the denominator of which is the total sales or
6 gross revenue of the taxpayer everywhere during
7 the tax period. "Sales", as used in this
8 subsection division does not include sales or
9 gross revenue which are separately allocated in
10 paragraph 4 of this subsection.
11 (1)
12 (a) Sales of tangible personal property have a
13 situs in this state if the property is
14 delivered or shipped to a purchaser other
15 than the United States government, within
16 this state regardless of the FOB point or
17 other conditions of the sale; or the
18 property is shipped from an office, store,
19 warehouse, factory or other place of storage
20 in this state and (a) the purchaser is the
21 United States government or (b) the taxpayer
22 is not doing business in the state of the
23 destination of the shipment.
24 (2)
ENGR. H. B. NO. 1200 Page 17
1 (b) In the case of a railroad or interurban
2 railway enterprise, the numerator of the
3 fraction shall not be less than the
4 allocation of revenues to this state as
5 shown in its annual report to the
6 Corporation Commission.
7 (3)
8 (c) In the case of an airline, truck or bus
9 enterprise or freight car, tank car,
10 refrigerator car or other railroad equipment
11 enterprise, the numerator of the fraction
12 shall include a portion of revenue from
13 interstate transportation in the proportion
14 that interstate mileage traveled in Oklahoma
15 bears to total interstate mileage traveled.
16 (4)
17 (d) In the case of an oil, gasoline or gas
18 pipeline enterprise, the numerator of the
19 fraction shall be either the total of
20 traffic units of the enterprise within
21 Oklahoma or the revenue allocated to
22 Oklahoma based upon miles moved, at the
23 option of the taxpayer, and the denominator
24 of which shall be the total of traffic units
ENGR. H. B. NO. 1200 Page 18
1 of the enterprise or the revenue of the
2 enterprise everywhere as appropriate to the
3 numerator. A "traffic unit" is hereby
4 defined as the transportation for a distance
5 of one (1) mile of one (1) barrel of oil,
6 one (1) gallon of gasoline or one thousand
7 (1,000) cubic feet of natural or casinghead
8 gas, as the case may be.
9 (5)
10 (e) In the case of a telephone or telegraph or
11 other communication enterprise, the
12 numerator of the fraction shall include that
13 portion of the interstate revenue as is
14 allocated pursuant to the accounting
15 procedures prescribed by the Federal
16 Communications Commission; provided that in
17 respect to each corporation or business
18 entity required by the Federal
19 Communications Commission to keep its books
20 and records in accordance with a uniform
21 system of accounts prescribed by such
22 Commission, the intrastate net income shall
23 be determined separately in the manner
24 provided by such uniform system of accounts
ENGR. H. B. NO. 1200 Page 19
1 and only the interstate income shall be
2 subject to allocation pursuant to the
3 provisions of this paragraph 4 of this
4 subsection. Provided further, that the
5 gross revenue factors shall be those as are
6 determined pursuant to the accounting
7 procedures prescribed by the Federal
8 Communications Commission.
9 In any case where the apportionment of the three factors
10 prescribed in this paragraph division (1), (2), or (3) of this
11 subparagraph attributes to Oklahoma a portion of net income of the
12 enterprise out of all appropriate proportion to the property owned
13 and/or business transacted within this state, because of the fact
14 that one or more of the factors so prescribed are not employed to
15 any appreciable extent in furtherance of the enterprise; or because
16 one or more factors not so prescribed are employed to a considerable
17 extent in furtherance of the enterprise; or because of other
18 reasons, the Tax Commission is empowered to permit, after a showing
19 by taxpayer that an excessive portion of net income has been
20 attributed to Oklahoma, or require, when in its judgment an
21 insufficient portion of net income has been attributed to Oklahoma,
22 the elimination, substitution, or use of additional factors, or
23 reduction or increase in the weight of such prescribed factors.
24 Provided, however, that any such variance from such prescribed
ENGR. H. B. NO. 1200 Page 20
1 fact ors which has the effect of increasing the portion of net income
2 attributable to Oklahoma must not be inherently arbitrary, and
3 application of the recomputed final apportionment to the net income
4 of the enterprise must attribute to Oklahoma only a reasonable
5 portion thereof.
6 6. For calendar years 1997 and 1998, the owner of a new or
7 expanded agricultural commodity processing facility in this state
8 may exclude from Oklahoma taxable income, or in the case of an
9 individual, the Oklahoma adjusted gross income, fifteen percent
10 (15%) of the investment by the owner in the new or expanded
11 agricultural commodity processing facility. For calendar year 1999,
12 and all subsequent years, the percentage, not to exceed fifteen
13 percent (15%), available to the owner of a new or expanded
14 agricultural commodity processing facility in this state claiming
15 the exemption shall be adjusted annually so that the total estimated
16 reduction in tax liability does not exceed One Million Dollars
17 ($1,000,000.00) annually. The Tax Commission shall promulgate rules
18 for determining the percentage of the investment which each eligible
19 taxpayer may exclude. The exclusion provided by this paragraph
20 shall be taken in the taxable year when the investment is made. In
21 the event the total reduction in tax liability authorized by this
22 paragraph exceeds One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) in any
23 calendar year, the Tax Commission shall permit any excess over One
24 Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) and shall factor such excess into
ENGR. H. B. NO. 1200 Page 21
1 the percentage for subsequent years. Any amount of the exemption
2 permitted to be excluded pursuant to the provisions of this
3 paragraph but not used in any year may be carried forward as an
4 exemption from income pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph
5 for a period not exceeding six (6) years following the year in which
6 the investment was originally made.
7 For purposes of this paragraph:
8 a. "Agricultural commodity processing facility" means
9 building, structures, fixtures and improvements used
10 or operated primarily for the processing or production
11 of marketable products from agricultural commodities.
12 The term shall also mean a dairy operation that
13 requires a depreciable investment of at least Two
14 Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($250,000.00) and which
15 produces milk from dairy cows. The term does not
16 include a facility that provides only, and nothing
17 more than, storage, cleaning, drying or transportation
18 of agricultural commodities, and
19 b. "Facility" means each part of the facility which is
20 used in a process primarily for:
21 (1) the processing of agricultural commodities,
22 including receiving or storing agricultural
23 commodities, or the production of milk at a dairy
24 operation,
ENGR. H. B. NO. 1200 Page 22
1 (2) transporting the agricultural commodities or
2 product before, during or after the processing,
3 or
4 (3) packaging or otherwise preparing the product for
5 sale or shipment.
6 7. Despite any provision to the contrary in paragraph 3 of this
7 subsection, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1999, in
8 the case of a taxpayer which has a farming loss, such farming loss
9 shall be considered a net operating loss carryback in accordance
10 with and to the extent of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C.,
11 Section 172(b)(G). However, the amount of the net operating loss
12 carryback shall not exceed the lesser of:
13 a. Sixty Thousand Dollars ($60,000.00), or
14 b. the loss properly shown on Schedule F of the Internal
15 Revenue Service Form 1040 reduced by one-half (1/2) of
16 the income from all other sources other than reflected
17 on Schedule F.

17 business or commercial situs apart from the
18 domicile of the taxpayer such income shall be
19 allocated in accordance with such business or
20 commercial situs; interest income from
21 investments held to generate working capital for
22 a unitary business enterprise shall be included

12 of such partnership's tangible property in this
13 state to the original cost of such partnership's
14 tangible property everywhere, as determined at
15 the time of the sale; if more than fifty percent
16 (50%) of the value of the partnership's assets
17 consists of intangible assets, capital or
18 ordinary gains or losses from the sale of an
19 ownership interest in the partnership shall be
20 allocated to this state in accordance with the
21 sales factor of the partnership for its first
22 full tax period immediately preceding its tax
23 period during which the ownership interest in the
24 partnership was sold; the provisions of this
ENGR. H. B. NO. 1200 Page 5

1 division shall only apply if the capital or
2 ordinary gains or losses from the sale of an
3 ownership interest in a partnership do not
4 constitute qualifying gain receiving capital
5 treatment as defined in subparagraph a of
6 paragraph 2 of subsection F of this section,
7 (3) income from such property which is required to be

17 enterprise the business of which in Oklahoma consists
18 solely of marketing its products by:
19 (1) sales having a situs without this state, shipped
20 directly to a point from without the state to a
21 purchaser within the state, commonly known as
22 interstate sales,
23 (2) sales of the product stored in public warehouses
24 within the state pursuant to "in transit"
ENGR. H. B. NO. 1200 Page 6

1 tariffs, as prescribed and allowed by the
2 Interstate Commerce Commission, to a purchaser
3 within the state,
4 (3) sales of the product stored in public warehouses
5 within the state where the shipment to such
6 warehouses is not covered by "in transit"
7 tariffs, as prescribed and allowed by the
8 Interstate Commerce Commission, to a purchaser
9 within or without the state,
10 the Oklahoma net income shall, at the option of the
11 taxpayer, be that portion of the total net income of
12 the taxpayer for federal income tax purposes derived
13 from the manufacture and/or processing and sales
14 everywhere as determined by the ratio of the sales
15 defined in this section made to the purchaser within
16 the state to the total sales everywhere. The term
17 "public warehouse" as used in this subparagraph means
18 a licensed public warehouse, the principal business of
19 which is warehousing merchandise for the public;
20 e. In the case of insurance companies, Oklahoma taxable
21 income shall be taxable income of the taxpayer for

ENGR. H. B. NO. 1200 Page 7

1 (1) except as otherwise provided by division (2) of
2 this subparagraph, taxable income of an insurance
3 company for a taxable year shall be apportioned
4 to this state by multiplying such income by a
5 fraction, the numerator of which is the direct
6 premiums written for insurance on property or
7 risks in this state, and the denominator of which
8 is the direct premiums written for insurance on
9 property or risks everywhere. For purposes of
10 this subsection, the term "direct premiums
11 written" means the total amount of direct
12 premiums written, assessments and annuity
13 considerations as reported for the taxable year
14 on the annual statement filed by the company with
15 the Insurance Commissioner in the form approved
16 by the National Association of Insurance
17 Commissioners, or such other form as may be
18 prescribed in lieu thereof,
19 (2) if the principal source of premiums written by an
20 insurance company consists of premiums for
21 reinsurance accepted by it, the taxable income of
22 such company shall be apportioned to this state
23 by multiplying such income by a fraction, the
24 numerator of which is the sum of (a) direct
ENGR. H. B. NO. 1200 Page 8

1 premiums written for insurance on property or
2 risks in this state, plus (b) premiums written
3 for reinsurance accepted in respect of property
4 or risks in this state, and the denominator of
5 which is the sum of (c) direct premiums written
6 for insurance on property or risks everywhere,
7 plus (d) premiums written for reinsurance
8 accepted in respect of property or risks
9 everywhere. For purposes of this paragraph,
10 premiums written for reinsurance accepted in
11 respect of property or risks in this state,
12 whether or not otherwise determinable, may at the
13 election of the company be determined on the
14 basis of the proportion which premiums written
15 for insurance accepted from companies
16 commercially domiciled in Oklahoma bears to
17 premiums written for reinsurance accepted from
18 all sources, or alternatively in the proportion
19 which the sum of the direct premiums written for
20 insurance on property or risks in this state by
21 each ceding company from which reinsurance is
22 accepted bears to the sum of the total direct
23 premiums written by each such ceding company for
24 the taxable year.

1 5. The a. Except as otherwise provided by subparagraph b or c
2 of this paragraph, for taxable years beginning not
3 later than December 31, 2025, the net income or loss
4 remaining after the separate allocation in paragraph 4
5 of this subsection, being that which is derived from a
6 unitary business enterprise, shall be apportioned to
7 this state on the basis of the arithmetical average of
8 three factors consisting of property, payroll and
9 sales or gross revenue enumerated as subparagraphs a,
10 b and c of this paragraph divisions (1), (2), and (3)
11 of subparagraph d of this paragraph. Net income or
12 loss as used in this paragraph includes that derived
13 from patent or copyright royalties, purchase
14 discounts, and interest on accounts receivable
15 relating to or arising from a business activity, the
16 income from which is apportioned pursuant to this
17 subsection, including the sale or other disposition of
18 such property and any other property used in the
19 unitary enterprise. Deductions used in computing such
20 net income or loss shall not include taxes based on or
21 measured by income. Provided, for
22 b. For all taxable years beginning on or after January 1,
23 2026, qualifying corporations may elect to use a
24 single sales factor apportionment comprising sales as
ENGR. H. B. NO. 1200 Page 10

1 one hundred percent (100%) of the apportionment or the
2 corporation may elect to compute Oklahoma taxable
3 income using the apportionment methodology in which
4 each of the three factors in subparagraph d of this
5 paragraph is equally weighted and an arithmetical
6 average of the three factors is determined as
7 otherwise provided by this paragraph. A qualifying
8 corporation is one whose property for purposes of the
9 tax imposed by Section 2355 of this title has an
10 initial cumulative investment cost equaling or
11 exceeding Two Hundred Million Dollars
12 ($200,000,000.00) One Hundred Million Dollars
13 ($100,000,000.00) over three (3) years and such
14 investment is made on or after July 1, 1997 January 1,
15 2018, or for corporations a corporation which expand
16 expands their property or facilities or which makes
17 improvements or upgrades or any combination of such
18 expenditures which shall be valued at the original
19 costs, prior to federal adjustments, at the time of
20 acquisition by the corporation and adjusted by
21 subsequent capital additions or improvements thereto
22 and partial disposition thereof, by reason of sale,
23 exchange, or abandonment, in this state and such
24 expansion has, improvements, upgrades, or expenditures
ENGR. H. B. NO. 1200 Page 11

1 have an investment cost equaling or exceeding Two
2 Hundred Million Dollars ($200,000,000.00) One Hundred
3 Million Dollars ($100,000,000.00) over a period not to
4 exceed three (3) years, and such expansion,
5 improvements, upgrades, or any combination of such
6 expenditures is commenced on or after January 1, 2000,
7 the three factors shall be apportioned with property
8 and payroll, each comprising twenty-five percent (25%)
9 of the apportionment factor and sales comprising fifty
10 percent (50%) of the apportionment factor January 1,
11 2018. The As used in this subparagraph, investments,
12 improvements, or expenditures shall include but not be
13 limited to:
14 (1) expenditures for intangible drilling costs, as
15 defined in Internal Revenue Code Section 263(c),
16 without regard to whether such intangible
17 drilling costs are capitalized or expensed for
18 federal income tax purposes,
19 (2) track structure expenditures, as defined in
20 Internal Revenue Procedure 2001-46, without
21 regard to whether such track costs are
22 capitalized or expensed for federal income tax
23 purposes, and
24
ENGR. H. B. NO. 1200 Page 12

1 (3) property received in a transaction that qualifies
2 as an Internal Revenue Code Section 332
3 liquidation; the investment period for such
4 property shall be the original investment period
5 of the liquidating corporation.
6 c. For any other corporation, for taxable years beginning
7 on or after January 1, 2026, Oklahoma taxable income
8 shall be computed using a single sales factor
9 comprising one hundred percent (100%) of the
10 apportionment and the corporation shall not use an
11 arithmetic average of the three factors consisting of
12 property, payroll, and sales. For the applicable tax
13 years, the apportionment factors shall be computed as
14 follows and for corporations required to use the
15 single sales factor the provisions of subparagraph d
16 of this paragraph shall be used to determine Oklahoma
17 taxable income as provided therein.
18 d. For corporations required or electing to use a single
19 sales factor apportionment, the provisions of division
20 (3) of this subparagraph shall be used to determine
21 Oklahoma taxable income as provided therein. For the
22 applicable tax years, or for qualifying corporations
23 electing the three-factor apportionment, the
24 apportionment factors shall be computed as follows:
ENGR. H. B. NO. 1200 Page 13

1 a.
2 (1) The property factor is a fraction, the numerator
3 of which is the average value of the taxpayer's
4 real and tangible personal property owned or
5 rented and used in this state during the tax
6 period and the denominator of which is the
7 average value of all the taxpayer's real and
8 tangible personal property everywhere owned or
9 rented and used during the tax period.
10 (1)
11 (a) Property, the income from which is
12 separately allocated in paragraph 4 of this
13 subsection, shall not be included in
14 determining this fraction. The numerator of
15 the fraction shall include a portion of the
16 investment in transportation and other
17 equipment having no fixed situs, such as
18 rolling stock, buses, trucks and trailers,
19 including machinery and equipment carried
20 thereon, airplanes, salespersons'
21 automobiles and other similar equipment, in
22 the proportion that miles traveled in
23 Oklahoma by such equipment bears to total
24 miles traveled,.
ENGR. H. B. NO. 1200 Page 14

1 (2)
2 (b) Property owned by the taxpayer is valued at
3 its original cost. Property rented by the
4 taxpayer is valued at eight times the net
5 annual rental rate. Net annual rental rate
6 is the annual rental rate paid by the
7 taxpayer, less any annual rental rate
8 received by the taxpayer from subrentals,.
9 (3)
10 (c) The average value of property shall be
11 determined by averaging the values at the
12 beginning and ending of the tax period but
13 the Oklahoma Tax Commission may require the
14 averaging of monthly values during the tax
15 period if reasonably required to reflect
16 properly the average value of the taxpayer's
17 property;.
18 b.
19 (2) The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator
20 of which is the total compensation for services
21 rendered in the state during the tax period, and
22 the denominator of which is the total
23 compensation for services rendered everywhere
24 during the tax period. "Compensation", as used
ENGR. H. B. NO. 1200 Page 15

1 in this subsection division means those paid-for
2 services to the extent related to the unitary
3 business but does not include officers' salaries,
4 wages and other compensation.
5 (1)
6 (a) In the case of a transportation enterprise,
7 the numerator of the fraction shall include
8 a portion of such expenditure in connection
9 with employees operating equipment over a
10 fixed route, such as railroad employees,
11 airline pilots, or bus drivers, in this
12 state only a part of the time, in the
13 proportion that mileage traveled in Oklahoma
14 bears to total mileage traveled by such
15 employees,.
16 (2)
17 (b) In any case the numerator of the fraction
18 shall include a portion of such expenditures
19 in connection with itinerant employees, such
20 as traveling salespersons, in this state
21 only a part of the time, in the proportion
22 that time spent in Oklahoma bears to total
23 time spent in furtherance of the enterprise
24 by such employees;.
ENGR. H. B. NO. 1200 Page 16

1 c.
2 (3) The sales factor is a fraction, the numerator of
3 which is the total sales or gross revenue of the
4 taxpayer in this state during the tax period, and
5 the denominator of which is the total sales or
6 gross revenue of the taxpayer everywhere during
7 the tax period. "Sales", as used in this
8 subsection division does not include sales or
9 gross revenue which are separately allocated in
10 paragraph 4 of this subsection.
11 (1)
12 (a) Sales of tangible personal property have a
13 situs in this state if the property is
14 delivered or shipped to a purchaser other
15 than the United States government, within
16 this state regardless of the FOB point or
17 other conditions of the sale; or the
18 property is shipped from an office, store,
19 warehouse, factory or other place of storage
20 in this state and (a) the purchaser is the
21 United States government or (b) the taxpayer
22 is not doing business in the state of the
23 destination of the shipment.
24 (2)
ENGR. H. B. NO. 1200 Page 17

1 (b) In the case of a railroad or interurban
2 railway enterprise, the numerator of the
3 fraction shall not be less than the
4 allocation of revenues to this state as
5 shown in its annual report to the
6 Corporation Commission.
7 (3)
8 (c) In the case of an airline, truck or bus
9 enterprise or freight car, tank car,
10 refrigerator car or other railroad equipment
11 enterprise, the numerator of the fraction
12 shall include a portion of revenue from
13 interstate transportation in the proportion
14 that interstate mileage traveled in Oklahoma
15 bears to total interstate mileage traveled.
16 (4)
17 (d) In the case of an oil, gasoline or gas
18 pipeline enterprise, the numerator of the
19 fraction shall be either the total of
20 traffic units of the enterprise within
21 Oklahoma or the revenue allocated to
22 Oklahoma based upon miles moved, at the
23 option of the taxpayer, and the denominator
24 of which shall be the total of traffic units
ENGR. H. B. NO. 1200 Page 18

1 of the enterprise or the revenue of the
2 enterprise everywhere as appropriate to the
3 numerator. A "traffic unit" is hereby
4 defined as the transportation for a distance
5 of one (1) mile of one (1) barrel of oil,
6 one (1) gallon of gasoline or one thousand
7 (1,000) cubic feet of natural or casinghead
8 gas, as the case may be.
9 (5)
10 (e) In the case of a telephone or telegraph or
11 other communication enterprise, the
12 numerator of the fraction shall include that
13 portion of the interstate revenue as is
14 allocated pursuant to the accounting
15 procedures prescribed by the Federal
16 Communications Commission; provided that in
17 respect to each corporation or business
18 entity required by the Federal
19 Communications Commission to keep its books
20 and records in accordance with a uniform
21 system of accounts prescribed by such
22 Commission, the intrastate net income shall
23 be determined separately in the manner
24 provided by such uniform system of accounts
ENGR. H. B. NO. 1200 Page 19

1 and only the interstate income shall be
2 subject to allocation pursuant to the
3 provisions of this paragraph 4 of this
4 subsection. Provided further, that the
5 gross revenue factors shall be those as are
6 determined pursuant to the accounting
7 procedures prescribed by the Federal
8 Communications Commission.
9 In any case where the apportionment of the three factors
10 prescribed in this paragraph division (1), (2), or (3) of this
11 subparagraph attributes to Oklahoma a portion of net income of the
12 enterprise out of all appropriate proportion to the property owned
13 and/or business transacted within this state, because of the fact
14 that one or more of the factors so prescribed are not employed to
15 any appreciable extent in furtherance of the enterprise; or because
16 one or more factors not so prescribed are employed to a considerable
17 extent in furtherance of the enterprise; or because of other
18 reasons, the Tax Commission is empowered to permit, after a showing
19 by taxpayer that an excessive portion of net income has been

21 insufficient portion of net income has been attributed to Oklahoma,
22 the elimination, substitution, or use of additional factors, or
23 reduction or increase in the weight of such prescribed factors.
24 Provided, however, that any such variance from such prescribed
ENGR. H. B. NO. 1200 Page 20

1 fact ors which has the effect of increasing the portion of net income
2 attributable to Oklahoma must not be inherently arbitrary, and
3 application of the recomputed final apportionment to the net income

6 6. For calendar years 1997 and 1998, the owner of a new or

24 Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) and shall factor such excess into
ENGR. H. B. NO. 1200 Page 21

2 permitted to be excluded pursuant to the provisions of this
3 paragraph but not used in any year may be carried forward as an
4 exemption from income pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph
5 for a period not exceeding six (6) years following the year in which
6 the investment was originally made.
7 For purposes of this paragraph:

15 title shall be equal to its adjusted tax basis for federal income
16 tax purposes.
17 B. 1. The taxable income of any corporation shall be further
18 adjusted to arrive at Oklahoma taxable income, except those
19 corporations electing treatment as provided in subchapter S of the

7 basis for all such assets placed into service after December 31,
8 1981, calculated in this section shall be retained and utilized for
9 all Oklahoma income tax purposes through the final disposition of
10 such assets.
11 Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Oklahoma Income Tax

13 Code to the contrary, this subsection shall control calculation of
