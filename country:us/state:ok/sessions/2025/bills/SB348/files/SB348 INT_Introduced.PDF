Req. No. 833 Page 11
1
of the school, and pay the rental charges for the usage during any

fiscal year, or portion thereof, out of appropriations made and
2
3
approved for current expense purposes during the fiscal year. Any

rental contract extending beyond June 30 of the fiscal year shall be

It is the intent of this subsection to authorize boards of education

8
9
against the school district in excess of the income and revenue
9
10
provided for such purposes for the fiscal year in which the lease
10
11
contract is operative. Any lease or lease-purchase agreement
11
12
entered into by any board of education shall state the purchase
12
13
price of real or personal property so leased. The lease or lease-
13
14
purchase shall not be extended so as to cause payment of more than
14

interest not to exceed the legal rate. When the purchase price plus
16
17
interest has been paid, the property shall belong to the lessee and

the lessor shall deliver a deed or bill of sale to the property to
18
19
the lessee. When any real or personal property has been leased or
19
20
rented during any fiscal year pursuant to the provisions of any
20
21
contract which permits continuance of the rental for the remainder
21
22
of the fiscal year, the renting or leasing of the property shall be
22
23
continued for the remainder of the fiscal year unless the board of
23
24
education renting or leasing the same certifies by proper resolution
24
Req. No. 833 Page 12
1
entered in the minutes of the board of education that the
1
2
continuance of the rental is unnecessary and contrary to the public
2
3
interest. Any lease-purchase agreement entered into shall include
3
4
the right of a school district to acquire buildings, equipment, or
4
5
other facilities or discrete components thereof or improve school
5
6
sites through a lease-purchase agreement. A school district may use
6
7
proceeds derived from the sale of bonds as authorized by Section 26
7
8
of Article X of the Oklahoma Constitution to make lease-purchase
8
9
payments, including interest, under a lease-purchase agreement. For
9
10
purposes of this subsection, the term “acquired” as used in Section
10
11
26 of Article X of the Oklahoma Constitution shall mean the
11
12
possession, control, or power to dispose of personal or real
12
13
property.
13
14
C. The boards of education of two or more school districts may

19
vocations, practical instruction in driver training courses, and
19
20
health programs including visual care by persons legally licensed
20
21
for such purpose, without favoritism as to either profession. The
21
22
revenues necessary to operate a joint program approved in
22
23
cooperative agreements, whether from federal, state, or local
23
24
sources, including the individual contributions of participating
24
Req. No. 833 Page 13
1
school districts, shall be deposited into a fund separate from all
1
2
other appropriated funds. The beginning fund balance each year,
2
3
combined with all actual revenues, including collected and estimated
3
4
revenues, must shall be appropriated before being expended.
4
5
Purchase orders shall be issued against available appropriations
5
6
and, once goods or services have been received, either payable or
6
7
nonpayable warrants shall be issued in payment of all purchase
7
8
orders. The fund shall be reported as a separate appropriated fund
8
9
in all the financial reports of the school district which is chosen
9
10
by the other school districts to keep the accounting records of the
10
11
joint program.

16
17
services, for each contracting district upon such terms and

18
conditions as the parties may agree. Nothing in this section shall

pursuant to law as set forth in Section 7-101 et seq. of this title.

B. The board of education of any school district may rent real
23
24
and personal property, if such items are necessary for the operation
24
Req. No. 833 Page 11

1
of the school, and pay the rental charges for the usage during any
1
2
fiscal year, or portion thereof, out of appropriations made and
2
3
approved for current expense purposes during the fiscal year. Any
3
4
rental contract extending beyond June 30 of the fiscal year shall be
4
5
void unless it contains provisions for mutual ratification of
5
6
renewal pursuant to the conditions provided for in this subsection.
6
7
It is the intent of this subsection to authorize boards of education
7
8
to enter into lease contracts but not to incur any obligation
8
9
against the school district in excess of the income and revenue
9
10
provided for such purposes for the fiscal year in which the lease
10
11
contract is operative. Any lease or lease-purchase agreement
11
12
entered into by any board of education shall state the purchase
12
13
price of real or personal property so leased. The lease or lease-
13
14
purchase shall not be extended so as to cause payment of more than
14
15
the original purchase price of the real or personal property, plus
15
16
interest not to exceed the legal rate. When the purchase price plus
16
17
interest has been paid, the property shall belong to the lessee and
17
18
the lessor shall deliver a deed or bill of sale to the property to
18
19
the lessee. When any real or personal property has been leased or
19
20
rented during any fiscal year pursuant to the provisions of any
20
21
contract which permits continuance of the rental for the remainder
21
22
of the fiscal year, the renting or leasing of the property shall be
22
23
continued for the remainder of the fiscal year unless the board of
23
24
education renting or leasing the same certifies by proper resolution
24
Req. No. 833 Page 12

1
entered in the minutes of the board of education that the
1
2
continuance of the rental is unnecessary and contrary to the public
2
3
interest. Any lease-purchase agreement entered into shall include
3
4
the right of a school district to acquire buildings, equipment, or
4
5
other facilities or discrete components thereof or improve school
5
6
sites through a lease-purchase agreement. A school district may use
6
7
proceeds derived from the sale of bonds as authorized by Section 26
7
8
of Article X of the Oklahoma Constitution to make lease-purchase
8
9
payments, including interest, under a lease-purchase agreement. For
9
10
purposes of this subsection, the term “acquired” as used in Section
10
11
26 of Article X of the Oklahoma Constitution shall mean the
11
12
possession, control, or power to dispose of personal or real
12
13
property.
13
14
C. The boards of education of two or more school districts may
14
15
enter into cooperative agreements and maintain joint programs
15
16
including, but not limited to, courses of instruction for
16
17
handicapped children with disabilities, courses of instruction in
17
18
music and other subjects, practical instruction for trades and
18
19
vocations, practical instruction in driver training courses, and
19
20
health programs including visual care by persons legally licensed
20
21
for such purpose, without favoritism as to either profession. The
21
22
revenues necessary to operate a joint program approved in
22
23
cooperative agreements, whether from federal, state, or local
23
24
sources, including the individual contributions of participating
24
Req. No. 833 Page 13

1
school districts, shall be deposited into a fund separate from all
1
2
other appropriated funds. The beginning fund balance each year,
2
3
combined with all actual revenues, including collected and estimated
3
4
revenues, must shall be appropriated before being expended.
4
5
Purchase orders shall be issued against available appropriations
5
6
and, once goods or services have been received, either payable or
6
7
nonpayable warrants shall be issued in payment of all purchase
7
8
orders. The fund shall be reported as a separate appropriated fund
8
9
in all the financial reports of the school district which is chosen
9
10
by the other school districts to keep the accounting records of the
10
11
joint program.
11
12
D. The boards of education of two or more school districts may
12
13
enter into a mutual contract or separate contracts with a
13
14
superintendent, administrator, or teacher or with a person to
14
15
provide support services, to serve as superintendent, administrator,
15
16
or teacher, as appropriately qualified, or to provide support
16
17
