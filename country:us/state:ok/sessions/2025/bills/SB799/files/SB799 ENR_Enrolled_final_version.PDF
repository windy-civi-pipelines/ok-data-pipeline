Section 6-401. A. As used in this section:

any electronic or digital communications, the
alternate adult shall:
(1) send a letter by return receipt mail to the last-
known address of the parent or legal guardian of
the student informing the parent or legal
guardian that the student may be designated as a
homeless child or youth and that an alternate
adult may be assigned to the student in school-
related communications if no response or
objection is received,
(2) allow a period of no less than fifteen (15)
business days for the parent or legal guardian to
respond or object to such designation, and
(3) file written verification with the school that no
objection was received, reasonable efforts to
locate or contact the parent or legal guardian
have been unsuccessful, and that the student
shall be designated as a homeless child or youth
and the alternate adult shall be included in
student-related communications.
b. The alternate adult shall promptly notify the school
if the alternate adult is no longer assigned to the
student, the student no longer meets the definition of
a homeless child or youth, a parent or legal guardian
objects to the student's designation, or any other
significant change in the student's circumstances as a
homeless child or youth;
2. "Electronic or digital communication" includes, but is not
limited to, emails, text messages, instant messages, direct

section may be made in case of an emergency, subject to subsequent
