16 participation as a network provider.
17 F. A pharmacy or pharmacist may decline to provide the
18 pharmacist clinical or dispensing services to a patient or pharmacy
19 benefits manager if the pharmacy or pharmacist is to be paid less
20 than the pharmacy’s cost for providing the pharmacist clinical or

2 otherwise make its provider network available to another pharmacy
3 benefits manager. Prohibited activities shall include, but not be

12 dispensed is no less than one hundred six percent (106%) of the
13 National Average Drug Acquisition Cost (NADAC) plus a professional
14 fee of Fifteen Dollars ($15.00). The NADAC price shall be the price
15 published in effect for the date the drug claim was billed by the
16 pharmacy. If a particular drug does not have a published NADAC
17 price, the reimbursement shall be one hundred ten percent (110%) of
