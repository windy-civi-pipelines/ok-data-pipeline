9 Oklahoma Constitution, and as further defined herein, shall be
10 exempt from the levy of any ad valorem taxes upon new, expanded or
11 acquired manufacturing facilities including facilities engaged in
12 research and development, for a period of five (5) years. The

20 Such facilities are hereby classified for the purposes of taxation
21 as provided in Section 22 of Article X of the Oklahoma Constitution.
22 B. For purposes of this section, the following definitions

6 following the initial year for which the exemption was granted.
7 Such facilities are hereby classified for the purposes of taxation
8 as provided in Section 22 of Article X of the Oklahoma Constitution.
9 B. For purposes of this section, the following definitions
10 shall apply:
