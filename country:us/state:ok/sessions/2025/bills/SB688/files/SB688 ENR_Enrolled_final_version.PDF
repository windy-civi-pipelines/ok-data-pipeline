SUBJECT: Ad valorem tax exemptions
BE IT ENACTED BY THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF OKLAHOMA:
SECTION 1. AMENDATORY 68 O.S. 2021, Section 2902, as
last amended by Section 1, Chapter 390, O.S.L. 2022 (68 O.S. Supp.
2024, Section 2902), is amended to read as follows:
Section 2902. A. Except as otherwise provided by subsection H
of Section 3658 of this title pursuant to which the exemption
authorized by this section may not be claimed, a qualifying
manufacturing concern, as defined by Section 6B of Article X of the
Oklahoma Constitution, and as further defined herein, shall be
exempt from the levy of any ad valorem taxes upon new, expanded or
acquired manufacturing facilities including facilities engaged in
research and development, for a period of five (5) years. The
provisions of Section 6B of Article X of the Oklahoma Constitution
requiring an existing facility to have been unoccupied for a period
of twelve (12) months prior to acquisition shall be construed as a
qualification for a facility to initially receive an exemption, and
shall not be deemed to be a qualification for that facility to
continue to receive an exemption in each of the four (4) years

following the initial year for which the exemption was granted.
Such facilities are hereby classified for the purposes of taxation
as provided in Section 22 of Article X of the Oklahoma Constitution.
B. For purposes of this section, the following definitions
shall apply:
1. “Manufacturing facilities” means facilities engaged in the
mechanical or chemical transformation of materials or substances
into new products and except as provided by paragraph 6 of
subsection C of this section shall include:
a. establishments which have received a manufacturer
exemption permit pursuant to the provisions of Section
1359.2 of this title,
b. facilities including repair and replacement parts,
primarily engaged in aircraft repair, building and
rebuilding whether or not on a factory basis,
c. establishments primarily engaged in computer services
and data processing as defined under Industrial Group
Numbers 5112 and 5415, and U.S. Industry Number 334611
and 519130 of the NAICS Manual, latest revision, and
which derive at least fifty percent (50%) of their
annual gross revenues from the sale of a product or
service to an out-of-state buyer or consumer, and as
defined under Industrial Group Number 5182 of the
NAICS Manual, latest revision, which derive at least
eighty percent (80%) of their annual gross revenues
from the sale of a product or service to an out-of-
state buyer or consumer. Eligibility as a
manufacturing facility pursuant to this subparagraph
shall be established, subject to review by the
Oklahoma Tax Commission, by annually filing an
affidavit with the Tax Commission stating that the
facility so qualifies and such other information as
required by the Tax Commission. For purposes of
determining whether annual gross revenues are derived
from sales to out-of-state buyers, all sales to the
federal government shall be considered to be an out-
of-state buyer,
ENR. S. B. NO. 688 Page 2

d. facilities that the investment cost of the
construction, acquisition or expansion is Five Hundred
Thousand Dollars ($500,000.00) or more with respect to
assets placed into service during calendar year 2022.
For subsequent calendar years, the investment required
shall be increased annually by a percentage equal to
the previous year’s increase in the Consumer Price
Index-All Urban Consumers (“CPI-U”) and such adjusted

ENR. S. B. NO. 688 Page 5

increasing or improving future or existing products or processes or
productivity.
C. The following provisions shall apply:
1. A manufacturing concern shall be entitled to the exemption
herein provided for each new manufacturing facility constructed,
each existing manufacturing facility acquired and the expansion of
existing manufacturing facilities on the same site, as such terms
are defined by Section 6B of Article X of the Oklahoma Constitution
and by this section;
2. No manufacturing concern shall receive more than one five-

if:
a. there is a net increase in annualized base payroll
over the initial payroll of at least Two Hundred Fifty
Thousand Dollars ($250,000.00) if the facility is

other than the facility which has previously or is currently
qualified to receive an exemption pursuant to the provisions of this
section and who are leased or otherwise provided to the facility, if
such employment did not exist in this state prior to the start of
initial construction or expansion of the facility. The
manufacturing concern shall submit an affidavit to the Tax
Commission, signed by an officer, stating that the construction,
acquisition or expansion of the facility will result in a net
increase in the annualized base payroll as required by this
paragraph and that full-time-equivalent employees of the facility
are or will be offered a basic health benefits plan as required by
this paragraph. If, after the completion of such construction or
expansion or after three (3) years from the start of initial

exemption granted including penalties and interest thereon, to the
Tax Commission for deposit to the Ad Valorem Reimbursement Fund;

a. there is a net increase in annualized payroll of the
applicant at any facility or facilities of the
applicant in this state of at least Two Hundred Fifty
Thousand Dollars ($250,000.00), which is attributable
to the capital improvements, or a net increase of
Seven Million Dollars ($7,000,000.00) or more in
capital improvements, while maintaining or increasing
payroll at the facility or facilities in this state
which are included in the application, and
b. the facility offers, or will offer within one hundred
eighty (180) days of the date of employment of new
employees attributable to the capital improvements, a
basic health benefits plan to the full-time-equivalent
employees of the facility, which is determined by the
Oklahoma Department of Commerce to consist of the
elements specified in subparagraph b of paragraph 1 of
subsection A of Section 3603 of this title or elements
substantially equivalent thereto.
