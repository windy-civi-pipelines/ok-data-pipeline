6
7
An Act relating to financial services; creating the
7
Financial Services Freedom Act; providing short
8

SECTION 1. NEW LAW A new section of law not to be
20
20
codified in the Oklahoma Statutes reads as follows:
21
21
This act shall be known and may be cited as the “Financial
22
22
Services Freedom Act”.

Req. No. 40 Page 1

SECTION 2. NEW LAW A new section of law not to be
1
2
codified in the Oklahoma Statutes reads as follows:
2
3
A. The Financial Services Freedom Act protects consumers by
3
4
providing transparency and safeguarding against politicized
4
5
debanking. The bill prohibits large banks and payment processors
5
6
from discriminating against customers because of their religious or
6
7
political speech or views, among other criteria often flagged as
7
8
part of a social credit score. It also increases transparency by
8
9
giving customers a right to an explanation from the financial
9
10
institution if their service is denied, restricted, or terminated.
10
11
B. This Legislature finds that:
11
12
1. Obtaining access to financial services is a basic
12
13
requirement for a person to meaningfully participate in the
13
14
marketplace of this state;
14
15
2. On account of their fundamental role in the marketplace,
15
16
this state and the United States government have given financial
16
17
institutions significant privileges and have enacted state and
17
18
federal laws that guarantee access to certain financial services
18
19
without discrimination based on race, color, religion, national
19
20
origin, sex, and other factors;
20
21
3. New banks and other financial institutions face significant
21
22
barriers to entry that reduce the competitiveness of the market and
22
23
allow existing institutions to wield significant power;
23
24
24
Req. No. 40 Page 2

1
4. Financial institutions should not act as de facto regulators
1
2
of private conduct by denying financial services based on a person’s
2
3
religious exercise, association, speech, social views, or
3
4
participation in a particular industry;
4
5
5. Financial institutions have a responsibility to make
5
6
decisions about whether to provide a person with financial services
6
7
on the basis of impartial criteria free from discrimination or
7
8
favoritism based on the above factors;
8
9
6. Financial institutions also have a responsibility to
9
10
disclose the conditions under which they will deny financial
10
11
services, and if they deny financial services, to provide upon
11
12
request a truthful and complete explanation to the person as to why
12
13
financial services were denied;
13
14
7. Financial institutions face increasing internal and external
14
15
pressures to impede otherwise lawful commerce based on a person’s
15
16
religious exercise, associations, speech, social views, or
16
17
participation in particular industries, and to do so covertly,
17
18
without informing the person or the public why services were or will
18
19
be denied;
19
20
8. When financial institutions omit material information about
20
21
when they will deny financial services or why they denied financial
21
22
services to a person, this lack of transparency harms specific
22
23
persons and the general marketplace;
23
24
24
Req. No. 40 Page 3

1
9. This kind of deception and unfair discrimination in the
1
2
provision of financial services threatens the economy, security, and
2
3
the soundness of banking and other financial markets in this state;
3
4
and
4
5
10. These deceptive and unfairly discriminatory practices
5
6
threaten the ability of the citizens of this state to speak freely
6
7
as part of the democratic process and to live freely according to
7
8
the dictates of their consciences, and these practices also violate
8
9
the public trust.

10
SECTION 3. NEW LAW A new section of law to be codified
