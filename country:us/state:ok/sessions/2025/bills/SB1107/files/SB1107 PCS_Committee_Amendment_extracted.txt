22 codified in the Oklahoma Statutes reads as follows:
23 This act shall be known and may be cited as the “Financial
24 Services Freedom Act”.
Req. No. 1766 Page 1
1 SECTION 2. NEW LAW A new section of law not to be
2 codified in the Oklahoma Statutes reads as follows:
3 A. The Financial Services Freedom Act protects consumers by
4 providing transparency and safeguarding against politicized
5 debanking. The bill prohibits large banks and payment processors
6 from discriminating against customers because of their religious or
7 political speech or views, among other criteria often flagged as
8 part of a social credit score. It also increases transparency by
9 giving customers a right to an explanation from the financial
10 institution if their service is denied, restricted, or terminated.
11 B. This Legislature finds that:
12 1. Obtaining access to financial services is a basic
13 requirement for a person to meaningfully participate in the
14 marketplace of this state;
15 2. On account of their fundamental role in the marketplace,
16 this state and the United States government have given financial
17 institutions significant privileges and have enacted state and
18 federal laws that guarantee access to certain financial services
19 without discrimination based on race, color, religion, national
20 origin, sex, and other factors;
21 3. New banks and other financial institutions face significant
22 barriers to entry that reduce the competitiveness of the market and
23 allow existing institutions to wield significant power;
24
Req. No. 1766 Page 2
1 4. Financial institutions should not act as de facto regulators
2 of private conduct by denying financial services based on a person’s
3 religious exercise, association, speech, social views, or
4 participation in a particular industry;
5 5. Financial institutions have a responsibility to make
6 decisions about whether to provide a person with financial services
7 on the basis of impartial criteria free from discrimination or
8 favoritism based on the above factors;
9 6. Financial institutions also have a responsibility to
10 disclose the conditions under which they will deny financial
11 services, and if they deny financial services, to provide upon
12 request a truthful and complete explanation to the person as to why
13 financial services were denied;
14 7. Financial institutions face increasing internal and external
15 pressures to impede otherwise lawful commerce based on a person’s
16 religious exercise, associations, speech, social views, or
17 participation in particular industries, and to do so covertly,
18 without informing the person or the public why services were or will
19 be denied;
20 8. When financial institutions omit material information about
21 when they will deny financial services or why they denied financial
22 services to a person, this lack of transparency harms specific
23 persons and the general marketplace;
24
Req. No. 1766 Page 3
1 9. This kind of deception and unfair discrimination in the
2 provision of financial services threatens the economy, security, and
3 the soundness of banking and other financial markets in this state;
4 and
5 10. These deceptive and unfairly discriminatory practices
6 threaten the ability of the citizens of this state to speak freely
