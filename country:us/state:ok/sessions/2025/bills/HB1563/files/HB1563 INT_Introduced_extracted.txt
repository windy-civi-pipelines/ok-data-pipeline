22
B. If the subpoena commands production of documents and things
23
or inspection of premises from a nonparty before trial but does not
24
Req. No. 10055 Page 6
1 requ ire attendance of a witness, the subpoena shall specify a date
2 and location for the production or inspection that is at least seven
3 (7) days after the date that the subpoena and copies of the subpoena
4 are served on the witness and all parties, and the subpoena shall
5 include the following language: "In order to allow objections to the
6 production of documents and things to be filed, you should not
7 produce them until the date specified in this subpoena and, if an
8 objection is filed, until the court rules on the objection."
9 C. A person commanded to produce and permit inspection,
10 copying, testing, or sampling of designated books, papers,
11 documents, electronically stored information or tangible things, or
12 inspection of premises, need not appear in person at the place of
13 production or inspection unless commanded to appear for deposition,
14 hearing, or trial.
15 D. Subject to subsection F of this section, a person commanded
16 to produce and permit inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, or
17 any party may, within fourteen (14) days after service of the
18 subpoena or before the time specified for compliance if such time is
19 less than fourteen (14) days after service, serve written objection
20 to inspection, copying, testing, or sampling of any or all of the
21 designated materials or of the premises, or to producing
22 electronically stored information in the form or forms requested.
23 An objection that all or a portion of the requested material will or
24 should be withheld on a claim that it is privileged or subject to
Req. No. 10055 Page 7
1 prot ection as trial preparation materials shall be made within this
2 time period and in accordance with subsections E and F of this
3 section. If the objection is made by the witness, the witness shall
4 serve the objection on all parties; if objection is made by a party,
5 the party shall serve the objection on the witness and all other
6 parties. If an objection is made, the party serving the subpoena
7 shall not be entitled to inspect, copy, test, or sample the
8 materials or inspect the premises except pursuant to an order of the
9 court by which the subpoena was issued. For failure to object in a
10 timely fashion, the court may assess reasonable costs and attorney
11 fees or take any other action it deems proper; however, a privilege
12 or the protection for trial preparation materials shall not be
13 waived solely for a failure to timely object under this section. If
14 objection has been made, the party serving the subpoena may, upon
15 notice to the person commanded to produce, move at any time for an
16 order to compel the production. Such an order to compel production
17 shall protect any person who is not a party or an officer of a party
18 from significant expense resulting from the inspection and copying
19 commanded.
20 E. 1. A person responding to a subpoena to produce documents
21 shall produce them as they are kept in the usual course of business

Req. No. 10055 Page 8
1 2. If a subpoena does not specify the form or forms for
2 producing electronically stored information, a person responding to
3 a subpoena shall produce the information in a form or forms in which
4 the person ordinarily maintains it or in a form or forms that are
5 reasonably usable.
6 3. A person responding to a subpoena is not required to produce
7 the same electronically stored information in more than one form.
8 4. A person responding to a subpoena is not required to provide
9 discovery of electronically stored information from sources that the
10 person identifies as not reasonably accessible because of undue
11 burden or cost. If such showing is made, the court may order
12 discovery from such sources if the requesting party shows good
13 cause, considering the limitations of this act. The court may
14 specify conditions for the discovery.
15 F. 1. When information subject to a subpoena is withheld on a
16 claim that it is privileged or subject to protection as trial
17 preparation materials, the claim shall be made expressly and shall
18 be supported by a description of the nature of the documents,
19 communications, or things not produced that is sufficient to enable
20 the demanding party to contest the claim.
21 2. If information is produced in response to a subpoena that is
22 subject to a claim or privilege or of protection as trial
23 preparation material, the person making the claim may notify any
24 party that received the information of the claim and the basis for
Req. No. 10055 Page 9
1 such claim. After being notified, a party shall promptly return,
2 sequester, or destroy the specified information and any copies the
3 party has and may not use or disclose the information until the
4 claim is resolved. A receiving party may promptly present the
5 information to the court under seal for a determination of the
6 claim. If the receiving party disclosed the information before
7 being notified, such party shall take reasonable steps to retrieve
8 the information. The person who produced the information shall
9 preserve the information until the claim is resolved. This
10 mechanism is procedural only and does not alter the standards
11 governing whether the information is privileged or subject to
12 protection as trial preparation material or whether such privilege
13 or protection has been waived.
14 SECTION 8. AMENDATORY 22 O.S. 2021, Section 712, is
15 amended to read as follows:
16 Section 712. A. Service of subpoenas for witnesses in criminal
17 actions in the district courts of this state a subpoena upon a
18 person named therein shall be made in the same manner as in civil
19 actions pursuant to Section 2004.1 of Title 12 of the Oklahoma
20 Statutes by delivering or mailing a copy thereof to such person and,
21 if the attendance of the person is demanded, by tendering to that
22 person the fees for one (1) day of attendance and the mileage
23 allowed by law. Service of a subpoena may be accomplished by any
24 person who is eighteen (18) years of age or older.
Req. No. 10055 Page 10
1 B. Service of a subpoena by mail may be accomplished by mailing
2 a copy thereof by certified mail with return receipt requested and
3 delivery restricted to the person named in the subpoena. The person
4 serving the subpoena shall make proof of service thereof to the
5 court promptly, and in any event, before the witness is required to
6 testify at the hearing or trial. If service is made by a person
7 other than a peace officer, such person shall make affidavit
8 thereof. If service is by mail, the person serving the subpoena
9 shall show in the proof of service the date and place of mailing and
10 attach a copy of the return receipt showing that the mailing was
11 accepted. Failure to make proof of service does not affect the
12 validity of the service, but service of a subpoena by mail shall not
13 be effective if the mailing was not accepted by the person named in
14 the subpoena. The cost costs of service of subpoenas shall be borne
15 by the parties unless otherwise ordered by the court allowed whether
16 service is made by a peace officer or any other person.
17 SECTION 9. AMENDATORY 22 O.S. 2021, Section 715, is
18 amended to read as follows:

22 in which the offense is triable, upon an affidavit of the district
23 attorney, or of the defendant or the defendant's counsel, stating
24 that he or she believes that the evidence and attendance of the
Req. No. 10055 Page 11
1 witn ess is material and necessary, shall endorse on the subpoena an
2 order for the attendance of the witness.
3 B. The court clerks of this state shall not be subject to
4 subpoena in matters relating to court records unless the court makes
5 a specific finding that the appearance and testimony of the court
6 clerk are both material and necessary because of a written objection
7 to the introduction of certified documents court records made by the
8 defendant or other party prior to trial.
9 SECTION 10. AMENDATORY 22 O.S. 2021, Section 716, is
10 amended to read as follows:

1 prot ection as trial preparation materials shall be made within this
2 time period and in accordance with subsections E and F of this
3 section. If the objection is made by the witness, the witness shall
4 serve the objection on all parties; if objection is made by a party,
5 the party shall serve the objection on the witness and all other
6 parties. If an objection is made, the party serving the subpoena
7 shall not be entitled to inspect, copy, test, or sample the
8 materials or inspect the premises except pursuant to an order of the
9 court by which the subpoena was issued. For failure to object in a
10 timely fashion, the court may assess reasonable costs and attorney
11 fees or take any other action it deems proper; however, a privilege
12 or the protection for trial preparation materials shall not be
13 waived solely for a failure to timely object under this section. If
14 objection has been made, the party serving the subpoena may, upon
15 notice to the person commanded to produce, move at any time for an
16 order to compel the production. Such an order to compel production
17 shall protect any person who is not a party or an officer of a party
18 from significant expense resulting from the inspection and copying
19 commanded.
20 E. 1. A person responding to a subpoena to produce documents
21 shall produce them as they are kept in the usual course of business
22 or shall organize and label them to correspond with the categories
23 in the demand.

1 2. If a subpoena does not specify the form or forms for
2 producing electronically stored information, a person responding to
3 a subpoena shall produce the information in a form or forms in which
4 the person ordinarily maintains it or in a form or forms that are
5 reasonably usable.
6 3. A person responding to a subpoena is not required to produce
7 the same electronically stored information in more than one form.
8 4. A person responding to a subpoena is not required to provide
9 discovery of electronically stored information from sources that the
10 person identifies as not reasonably accessible because of undue
11 burden or cost. If such showing is made, the court may order
12 discovery from such sources if the requesting party shows good
13 cause, considering the limitations of this act. The court may
14 specify conditions for the discovery.
15 F. 1. When information subject to a subpoena is withheld on a
16 claim that it is privileged or subject to protection as trial
17 preparation materials, the claim shall be made expressly and shall
18 be supported by a description of the nature of the documents,
19 communications, or things not produced that is sufficient to enable
20 the demanding party to contest the claim.
21 2. If information is produced in response to a subpoena that is
22 subject to a claim or privilege or of protection as trial
23 preparation material, the person making the claim may notify any
24 party that received the information of the claim and the basis for
Req. No. 10055 Page 9

1 such claim. After being notified, a party shall promptly return,
2 sequester, or destroy the specified information and any copies the
3 party has and may not use or disclose the information until the
4 claim is resolved. A receiving party may promptly present the
5 information to the court under seal for a determination of the
6 claim. If the receiving party disclosed the information before
7 being notified, such party shall take reasonable steps to retrieve
8 the information. The person who produced the information shall
9 preserve the information until the claim is resolved. This
10 mechanism is procedural only and does not alter the standards
11 governing whether the information is privileged or subject to
12 protection as trial preparation material or whether such privilege
13 or protection has been waived.
14 SECTION 8. AMENDATORY 22 O.S. 2021, Section 712, is
15 amended to read as follows:
16 Section 712. A. Service of subpoenas for witnesses in criminal
17 actions in the district courts of this state a subpoena upon a
18 person named therein shall be made in the same manner as in civil
19 actions pursuant to Section 2004.1 of Title 12 of the Oklahoma
20 Statutes by delivering or mailing a copy thereof to such person and,
21 if the attendance of the person is demanded, by tendering to that
22 person the fees for one (1) day of attendance and the mileage
23 allowed by law. Service of a subpoena may be accomplished by any
24 person who is eighteen (18) years of age or older.
Req. No. 10055 Page 10

1 B. Service of a subpoena by mail may be accomplished by mailing
2 a copy thereof by certified mail with return receipt requested and
3 delivery restricted to the person named in the subpoena. The person
4 serving the subpoena shall make proof of service thereof to the
5 court promptly, and in any event, before the witness is required to
6 testify at the hearing or trial. If service is made by a person
7 other than a peace officer, such person shall make affidavit
8 thereof. If service is by mail, the person serving the subpoena
9 shall show in the proof of service the date and place of mailing and
10 attach a copy of the return receipt showing that the mailing was
11 accepted. Failure to make proof of service does not affect the
12 validity of the service, but service of a subpoena by mail shall not
13 be effective if the mailing was not accepted by the person named in
14 the subpoena. The cost costs of service of subpoenas shall be borne
15 by the parties unless otherwise ordered by the court allowed whether
16 service is made by a peace officer or any other person.
17 SECTION 9. AMENDATORY 22 O.S. 2021, Section 715, is
18 amended to read as follows:
19 Section 715. A. No person is obliged to attend as a witness
20 before a court or magistrate outside the county where the witness
21 resides or is served with a subpoena, unless the judge of the court
22 in which the offense is triable, upon an affidavit of the district
23 attorney, or of the defendant or the defendant's counsel, stating
24 that he or she believes that the evidence and attendance of the
Req. No. 10055 Page 11

1 witn ess is material and necessary, shall endorse on the subpoena an
2 order for the attendance of the witness.
3 B. The court clerks of this state shall not be subject to
4 subpoena in matters relating to court records unless the court makes
5 a specific finding that the appearance and testimony of the court
6 clerk are both material and necessary because of a written objection
7 to the introduction of certified documents court records made by the
8 defendant or other party prior to trial.
9 SECTION 10. AMENDATORY 22 O.S. 2021, Section 716, is
10 amended to read as follows:
11 Section 716. Disobedience or failure by any person without
12 adequate excuse to obey a subpoena served upon himself or herself,
13 or a refusal to be sworn or to testify, may be punished by the court
14 or magistrate, as for deemed a criminal contempt, in the manner
15 provided in civil procedure of the court from which the subpoena was
16 issued.
17 SECTION 11. This act shall become effective November 1, 2025.
