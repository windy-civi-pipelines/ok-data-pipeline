11 copying, testing, or sampling of designated books, papers,

18 notice to the person commanded to produce, move at any time for an

13 burden or cost. If such showing is made, the court may order
14 discovery from such sources if the requesting party shows good
15 cause, considering the limitations of this section. The court may
16 specify conditions for the discovery.

18 claim that it is privileged or subject to protection as trial
19 preparation materials, the claim shall be made expressly and shall
20 be supported by a description of the nature of the documents,
21 communications, or tangible things not produced that is sufficient

17 shall not apply to any human victim who is the subject in a criminal
18 action being prosecuted by the state.

13 mail, the person serving the subpoena shall show in the proof of
14 service the date and place of mailing and attach a copy of the
15 return receipt showing that the mailing was accepted. Failure to
16 make proof of service does not affect the validity of the service,
17 but service of a subpoena by mail shall not be effective if the
18 mailing was not accepted by the person named in the subpoena. The
19 cost costs of service of subpoenas shall be borne by the parties
20 unless otherwise ordered by the court allowed whether service is
21 made by a peace officer or by any other person.
