2 the name of the district. One copy of the contract shall be filed
3 with the clerk of the board of education and one copy shall be
4 retained by the teacher.
5 B. Except as otherwise provided by subsections J K and K L of
6 this section and any other law, no board of education shall have
7 authority to enter into any written contract with a teacher who does
8 not hold an Oklahoma criminal history record check as required by
9 Section 6-190 of this title and who does not hold a valid
10 certificate issued or recognized by the State Board of Education
11 authorizing the teacher to teach the grades or subject matter for
12 which the teacher is employed. Any board of education paying or
13 authorizing the payment of the salary of any teacher not holding a
14 certificate, as required herein, shall be adjudged to be guilty of a
15 fraudulent expenditure of public funds and members voting for such
16 payment shall be held jointly responsible for the return of the
17 amount of any public monies thus expended, upon suit brought by the
18 district attorney or by any interested citizen in the district where
19 such funds have been expended.
20 C. It shall be the duty of the superintendent of schools under
21 whose supervision teachers have been contracted to teach to certify
22 to the treasurer of the contracting district the names of the
23 teachers holding valid certificates and student teachers with whom
24 contracts have been made and the names of substitute teachers

5 violation of the provisions of this section.
6 D. Whenever any person shall enter into a contract with any
7 school district in Oklahoma to teach in such school district the
8 contract shall be binding on the teacher and on the board of
9 education until the teacher legally has been discharged from the
10 teaching position or released by the board of education from the
11 contract. Except as provided in Section 5-106A of this title, until
12 such teacher has been thus discharged or released, the teacher shall
13 not have authority to enter into a contract with any other board of
14 education in Oklahoma for the same time covered by the original
15 contract. If upon written complaint by the board of education in a
16 district any teacher is reported to have failed to obey the terms of
17 the contract previously made and to have entered into a contract
18 with another board of education without having been released from
19 the former contract except as provided in Section 5-106A of this
20 title, the teacher, upon being found guilty of such charge at a
21 hearing held before the State Board of Education, shall have such
22 teacher's certificate suspended for the remainder of the term for
23 which the contract was made.

18 with a certified teacher for a period of time that is less than one
19 (1) school year, unless the certified teacher is hired after the
20 school year has begun. Written contracts entered or renewed
21 pursuant to this subsection shall include the entirety of a given

17 shall be liable for the payment of compensation to any teacher or

21 necessary to close the school because of inability to secure a
22 suitable building or buildings for continuation of school. Teachers
23 and administrators shall be entitled to pay for any time lost when
