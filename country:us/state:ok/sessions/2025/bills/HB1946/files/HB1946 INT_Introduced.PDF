12 education in Oklahoma for the same time covered by the original
13 contract. If upon written complaint by the board of education in a
14 district any teacher is reported to have failed to obey the terms of
15 the contract previously made and to have entered into a contract
16 with another board of education without having been released from
17 the former contract except as provided in Section 5-106A of this
18 title, the teacher, upon being found guilty of such charge at a
19 hearing held before the State Board of Education, shall have such
20 teacher's certificate suspended for the remainder of the term for
