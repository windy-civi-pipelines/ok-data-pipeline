3 plat is in compliance with the adopted subdivision code, and meets
4 all applicable ordinances, and the governing body and planning
5 commission accept any proposed dedications, if applicable, the plat
6 shall be approved.

8 decision-making process, determinations shall be made using
9 applicable objective and relevant facts as to proposed plats as well
10 as utilizing processes, standards, and requirements outlined in the
11 municipal code. Compliance with comprehensive plans shall not be a

17 municipal planning commission for its approval or rejection. Before
18 said the plans, plats, or replats shall be entitled to be recorded
19 in the office of the county clerk, they shall be approved by the
20 municipal governing body. It shall be unlawful to offer and cause
21 to be recorded any such plan, plat, or replat in any public office
22 unless the same shall bear thereon, by endorsement or otherwise, the
23 approval of the municipal governing body. Any plat filed without
24 the endorsed approval of the municipal governing body shall not
Req. No. 1603 Page 7

1 impo rt notice nor impose any obligation or duties on the
2 municipality. The disapproval of any such plan, plat, or replat by
3 the municipal governing body shall be deemed a refusal of the
4 proposed dedication shown thereon.
5 C. The municipal planning commission may exercise jurisdiction
6 over subdivision of land and adopt regulations governing the
7 subdivision of land within its jurisdiction. Any such regulations,
8 before they become effective, shall be approved by the municipal
9 governing body and shall be published as provided by law for the
10 publication of ordinances. Such regulations may include provisions
11 as to the extent to which streets and other ways shall be graded and
12 improved and to which water, sewer, and other utility mains, piping,
13 or other facilities shall be installed as a condition precedent to
14 the approval of the plat. The regulations may provide for a
15 tentative approval of the plat before such installation. Any such
16 tentative approval shall be revocable for failure to comply with
17 commitments upon which the tentative approval was based and shall
18 not be entered on the plat. In lieu of the completion of any
19 improvements or utilities prior to the final approval of the plat,
20 the commission may accept an adequate bond with surety, satisfactory
21 to the commission, to secure for the municipality the actual
22 construction and installation of the improvements or utilities at a
23 time and according to specifications fixed by or in accordance with
24 the regulations of the commission, and further conditioned that the
Req. No. 1603 Page 8

1 deve loper will pay for all material and labor relating to the
2 construction of the improvements. The municipality may enforce said
3 such bond by all appropriate legal and equitable remedies. Nothing
4 in this section shall be construed as granting to any municipality
5 or planning commission the power to direct any public utility to
6 extend its services to any particular area.
7 D. Upon adoption of the regulations governing the subdivision
8 of land as provided in subsection C of this section, no plat or deed
9 or other instrument concerning the subdivision of land within the
10 corporate limits of a municipality shall be filed with the county
11 clerk until it has been approved by the municipal planning
12 commission of that municipality in accordance with the officially
13 adopted regulations of subdivisions of that commission. If such
14 approval is needed, the approval shall be endorsed on the face of
15 the plat, or in the case of a deed or other instrument, in the form
16 of a special subdivision certificate. If the adopted regulations
17 exempt a certain subdivision of land from the approval requirement,
18 the municipal planning commission shall provide to the county clerk
19 an exemption statement to accompany the deed or instrument to be
20 filed.
21 E. A municipality which contains large areas of rural land not
22 served by water and sewer facilities by the municipality shall
23 authorize the use of private roadways in either platted or unplatted
24 areas and shall issue building permits to property owners whose
Req. No. 1603 Page 9

1 prop erty is abutting upon the private roadways, without complying
2 with standards as provided for dedicated streets, subject to the
3 following conditions:
4 1. The private roadway easement shall be at least fifty (50)
5 feet in width; and
6 2. The property abutting upon the private roadway shall contain
7 not less than two (2) acres; provided, however, if the covenants of
8 the subdivision allow for Evapotranspiration Absorption Systems
9 evapotranspiration absorption systems or an Aerobic Wastewater
10 Treatment System aerobic wastewater treatment system, the property
11 abutting upon the private roadway may contain not less than one (1)
12 acre; and
13 3. The property shall be more than one-fourth (1/4) mile from
14 sewer and water facilities furnished by the municipality; and
15 4. The private roadway shall not be dedicated to the public but
16 reserved for future dedication and, until such future dedication,
17 shall be the private roadway of the owners of the abutting property;
18 and
19 5. The private roadway shall be maintained by the owners of the
20 property within the subdivision; and
21 6. The municipality shall have no responsibility for the
22 maintenance or repair of the private roadway; and
23 7. If the property is platted, there shall be emblematized on
24 the face of the plat, clearly conspicuous, a notice that the streets
Req. No. 1603 Page 10

1 and drives have not been dedicated to the public and that the
2 streets shall be maintained by the private property owners within
3 the subdivision. Said Such streets shall always be open to police,
4 fire, and other official vehicles of all state, federal, county, and
5 municipal agencies; and
6 8. Every deed shall clearly acknowledge that the roadway is
7 private and not maintained by the municipality; and
8 9. Prior to the sale of any parcel of land in the subdivision,
9 a conspicuous sign shall be posted at the entrance to the
10 subdivision: “Private roadway not maintained by __________ (the
11 municipality)”. At any time after the municipality permits the use
12 of said such private roadway, a petition of the owners of at least
13 sixty percent (60%) of the area of the land to improve and dedicate
14 the street shall bind all of the owners thereby to permanently
15 improve the street or roadway in compliance with the requirements of
16 the municipality; and
17 10. The planning commission may require the developer of such
18 property to reserve appropriate utility easements for water, sewer,
19 and any other utility installations as may be required for present
20 and future development.
21 F. Municipal platting decisions are quasi-judicial in nature.
22 The planning commission and the governing body of a municipality
23 shall have reasonable discretion to determine the compliance of
24 preliminary and final plats with the municipality’s adopted
Req. No. 1603 Page 11

1 subd ivision regulations and all applicable codes and ordinances. If
2 the planning commission and governing body determine the proposed
3 plat is in compliance with the adopted subdivision code, and meets
4 all applicable ordinances, and the governing body and planning
5 commission accept any proposed dedications, if applicable, the plat
6 shall be approved.
7 G. While comprehensive plans may be utilized as a guide in the
8 decision-making process, determinations shall be made using
9 applicable objective and relevant facts as to proposed plats as well
10 as utilizing processes, standards, and requirements outlined in the
11 municipal code. Compliance with comprehensive plans shall not be a
12 requirement for plat approval.
13 H. In the case of a preliminary or final plat denial, if
14 requested by the applicant at the meeting on the vote, the city
15 attorney or contracted counsel shall identify on the record the
16 basis for the denial, including at a minimum all of the applicable
17 objective and relevant facts upon which the denial is based.
18 I. The notice and hearing provisions in Sections 43-104 through
19 43-106 of this title, or as otherwise may be applicable, are
20 intended to provide members of the public with a right to be heard,
21 explain how they think their interests are affected, and bring to
22 the attention of the governing body objective and relevant facts.
23 However, decisions on land use applications shall not be based
24
Req. No. 1603 Page 12

1 sole ly upon the presence, numbers, or magnitude of opposition or
2 protests in the absence of objective and relevant facts.
3 SECTION 5. This act shall become effective November 1, 2025.
