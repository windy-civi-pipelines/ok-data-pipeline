12 blocks, and the streets, alleys, or other portions of the same,
13 intended to be dedicated to public or private use, within the
14 corporate limits of a municipality, shall first be submitted to the
15 municipal planning commission for its approval or rejection. Before
16 said the plans, plats, or replats shall be entitled to be recorded
17 in the office of the county clerk, they shall be approved by the
18 municipal governing body. It shall be unlawful to offer and cause
19 to be recorded any such plan, plat, or replat in any public office

13 tentative approval of the plat before such installation. Any such
14 tentative approval shall be revocable for failure to comply with
15 commitments upon which the tentative approval was based and shall
16 not be entered on the plat. In lieu of the completion of any
17 improvements or utilities prior to the final approval of the plat,
18 the commission may accept an adequate bond with surety, satisfactory
19 to the commission, to secure for the municipality the actual
20 construction and installation of the improvements or utilities at a
21 time and according to specifications fixed by or in accordance with
22 the regulations of the commission, and further conditioned that the
23 developer will pay for all material and labor relating to the
24 construction of the improvements. The municipality may enforce said
Req. No. 13593 Page 8
1 such bond by all appropriate legal and equitable remedies. Nothing
2 in this section shall be construed as granting to any municipality
3 or planning commission the power to direct any public utility to
4 extend its services to any particular area.

11 adopted regulations of subdivisions of that commission. If such
12 approval is needed, the approval shall be endorsed on the face of
13 the plat, or in the case of a deed or other instrument, in the form
14 of a special subdivision certificate. If the adopted regulations
15 exempt a certain subdivision of land from the approval requirement,
16 the municipal planning commission shall provide to the county clerk
17 an exemption statement to accompany the deed or instrument to be
18 filed.
19 E. A municipality which contains large areas of rural land not
20 served by water and sewer facilities by the municipality shall

22 areas and shall issue building permits to property owners whose
23 property is abutting upon the private roadways, without complying

10 abutting upon the private roadway may contain not less than one (1)
11 acre; and

17 and
18 5. The private roadway shall be maintained by the owners of the
19 property within the subdivision; and
20 6. The municipality shall have no responsibility for the
21 maintenance or repair of the private roadway; and
22 7. If the property is platted, there shall be emblematized on
23 the face of the plat, clearly conspicuous, a notice that the streets
24 and drives have not been dedicated to the public and that the
Req. No. 13593 Page 10
1 stre ets shall be maintained by the private property owners within

10 municipality)". At any time after the municipality permits the use
11 of said such private roadway, a petition of the owners of at least
12 sixty percent (60%) of the area of the land to improve and dedicate
13 the street shall bind all of the owners thereby to permanently
14 improve the street or roadway in compliance with the requirements of
15 the municipality; and
16 10. The planning commission may require the developer of such
17 property to reserve appropriate utility easements for water, sewer,
18 and any other utility installations as may be required for present

21 The planning commission and the governing body of a municipality
22 shall have reasonable discretion to determine the compliance of
23 preliminary and final plats with the municipality's adopted
24 subdivision regulations and all applicable codes and ordinances. If
Req. No. 13593 Page 11
1 the planning commission and governing body determine the proposed
2 plat is in compliance with the adopted subdivision code, and meets
3 all applicable ordinances, and the governing body and planning
4 commission accept any proposed dedications, if applicable, the plat
5 shall be approved.
6 G. While comprehensive plans may be utilized as a guide in the
7 decision-making process, determinations shall be made using
8 applicable objective and relevant facts as to proposed plats as well
9 as utilizing processes, standards, and requirements outlined in the
10 municipal code. Compliance with comprehensive plans shall not be a
11 requirement for plat approval.
12 H. In the case of a preliminary or final plat denial, if
13 requested by the applicant at the meeting on the vote, the city
14 shall identify on the record, or in the minutes of the meeting, the
15 basis for the denial, including at a minimum all of the applicable
16 objective and relevant facts upon which the denial is based.
17 I. The notice and hearing provisions in Sections 43-104 through
18 43-106 of this title, or as otherwise may be applicable, are
19 intended to provide members of the public with a right to be heard,
20 explain how they think their interests are affected, and bring to
21 the attention of the governing body objective and relevant facts.
22 Information presented from the public that is neither objective or
23 relevant shall not be determinative in land use application
24 proceedings.

Req. No. 13593 Page 6

1 Section 45-104. A. Before final action may be taken by any
2 municipality or department thereof on the location, construction, or
3 design of any public building, statue, memorial, park, parkway,
4 boulevard, street, alley, playground, public ground, or bridge, or
5 the change in the location or grade of any street or alley, the
6 question shall be submitted to the planning commission for
7 investigation and report. Counties and school districts may be
8 exempted from the payment of a fee to obtain any license or permit
9 required by a zoning, building, or similar ordinance of a
10 municipality.
11 B. All plans, plats, or replats of land laid out in lots or
12 blocks, and the streets, alleys, or other portions of the same,
13 intended to be dedicated to public or private use, within the
14 corporate limits of a municipality, shall first be submitted to the
15 municipal planning commission for its approval or rejection. Before
16 said the plans, plats, or replats shall be entitled to be recorded
17 in the office of the county clerk, they shall be approved by the
18 municipal governing body. It shall be unlawful to offer and cause
19 to be recorded any such plan, plat, or replat in any public office
20 unless the same shall bear thereon, by endorsement or otherwise, the
21 approval of the municipal governing body. Any plat filed without
22 the endorsed approval of the municipal governing body shall not
23 import notice nor impose any obligation or duties on the
24 municipality. The disapproval of any such plan, plat, or replat by
Req. No. 13593 Page 7

1 the municipal governing body shall be deemed a refusal of the
2 proposed dedication shown thereon.
3 C. The municipal planning commission may exercise jurisdiction
4 over subdivision of land and adopt regulations governing the
5 subdivision of land within its jurisdiction. Any such regulations,
6 before they become effective, shall be approved by the municipal
7 governing body and shall be published as provided by law for the
8 publication of ordinances. Such regulations may include provisions
9 as to the extent to which streets and other ways shall be graded and
10 improved and to which water, sewer, and other utility mains, piping,
11 or other facilities shall be installed as a condition precedent to
12 the approval of the plat. The regulations may provide for a
13 tentative approval of the plat before such installation. Any such
14 tentative approval shall be revocable for failure to comply with
15 commitments upon which the tentative approval was based and shall
16 not be entered on the plat. In lieu of the completion of any
17 improvements or utilities prior to the final approval of the plat,
18 the commission may accept an adequate bond with surety, satisfactory
19 to the commission, to secure for the municipality the actual
20 construction and installation of the improvements or utilities at a
21 time and according to specifications fixed by or in accordance with
22 the regulations of the commission, and further conditioned that the
23 developer will pay for all material and labor relating to the
24 construction of the improvements. The municipality may enforce said
Req. No. 13593 Page 8

1 such bond by all appropriate legal and equitable remedies. Nothing
2 in this section shall be construed as granting to any municipality
3 or planning commission the power to direct any public utility to
4 extend its services to any particular area.
5 D. Upon adoption of the regulations governing the subdivision
6 of land as provided in subsection C of this section, no plat or deed
7 or other instrument concerning the subdivision of land within the
8 corporate limits of a municipality shall be filed with the county
9 clerk until it has been approved by the municipal planning
10 commission of that municipality in accordance with the officially
11 adopted regulations of subdivisions of that commission. If such
12 approval is needed, the approval shall be endorsed on the face of
13 the plat, or in the case of a deed or other instrument, in the form
14 of a special subdivision certificate. If the adopted regulations
15 exempt a certain subdivision of land from the approval requirement,
16 the municipal planning commission shall provide to the county clerk
17 an exemption statement to accompany the deed or instrument to be
18 filed.
19 E. A municipality which contains large areas of rural land not
20 served by water and sewer facilities by the municipality shall
21 authorize the use of private roadways in either platted or unplatted
22 areas and shall issue building permits to property owners whose
23 property is abutting upon the private roadways, without complying
24

16 shall be the private roadway of the owners of the abutting property;
17 and
18 5. The private roadway shall be maintained by the owners of the
19 property within the subdivision; and
20 6. The municipality shall have no responsibility for the
21 maintenance or repair of the private roadway; and
22 7. If the property is platted, there shall be emblematized on
23 the face of the plat, clearly conspicuous, a notice that the streets
24 and drives have not been dedicated to the public and that the
Req. No. 13593 Page 10

1 stre ets shall be maintained by the private property owners within
2 the subdivision. Said Such streets shall always be open to police,
3 fire, and other official vehicles of all state, federal, county, and
4 municipal agencies; and
5 8. Every deed shall clearly acknowledge that the roadway is
6 private and not maintained by the municipality; and
7 9. Prior to the sale of any parcel of land in the subdivision,
8 a conspicuous sign shall be posted at the entrance to the
9 subdivision: "Private roadway not maintained by __________ (the
10 municipality)". At any time after the municipality permits the use
11 of said such private roadway, a petition of the owners of at least
12 sixty percent (60%) of the area of the land to improve and dedicate
13 the street shall bind all of the owners thereby to permanently
14 improve the street or roadway in compliance with the requirements of
15 the municipality; and
16 10. The planning commission may require the developer of such
17 property to reserve appropriate utility easements for water, sewer,
18 and any other utility installations as may be required for present
19 and future development.
20 F. Municipal platting decisions are quasi-judicial in nature.
21 The planning commission and the governing body of a municipality
22 shall have reasonable discretion to determine the compliance of
23 preliminary and final plats with the municipality's adopted
24 subdivision regulations and all applicable codes and ordinances. If
Req. No. 13593 Page 11

1 the planning commission and governing body determine the proposed
2 plat is in compliance with the adopted subdivision code, and meets
3 all applicable ordinances, and the governing body and planning
4 commission accept any proposed dedications, if applicable, the plat
5 shall be approved.
6 G. While comprehensive plans may be utilized as a guide in the
7 decision-making process, determinations shall be made using
8 applicable objective and relevant facts as to proposed plats as well
9 as utilizing processes, standards, and requirements outlined in the
10 municipal code. Compliance with comprehensive plans shall not be a
11 requirement for plat approval.
12 H. In the case of a preliminary or final plat denial, if
13 requested by the applicant at the meeting on the vote, the city
14 shall identify on the record, or in the minutes of the meeting, the
15 basis for the denial, including at a minimum all of the applicable
16 objective and relevant facts upon which the denial is based.
17 I. The notice and hearing provisions in Sections 43-104 through
18 43-106 of this title, or as otherwise may be applicable, are
19 intended to provide members of the public with a right to be heard,
20 explain how they think their interests are affected, and bring to
21 the attention of the governing body objective and relevant facts.
22 Information presented from the public that is neither objective or
23 relevant shall not be determinative in land use application
24 proceedings.
