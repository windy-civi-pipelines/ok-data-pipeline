intended to be dedicated to public or private use, within the

6
corporate limits of a municipality, shall first be submitted to the

municipal planning commission for its approval or rejection. Before

13
approval of the municipal governing body. Any plat filed without
13
14
the endorsed approval of the municipal governing body shall not
14
15
import notice nor impose any obligation or duties on the
15
16
municipality. The disapproval of any such plan, plat, or replat by
16
17
the municipal governing body shall be deemed a refusal of the
17
18
proposed dedication shown thereon.
18
19
C. The municipal planning commission may exercise jurisdiction
19
20
over subdivision of land and adopt regulations governing the
20
21
subdivision of land within its jurisdiction. Any such regulations,
21
22
before they become effective, shall be approved by the municipal
22
23
governing body and shall be published as provided by law for the
23
24
publication of ordinances. Such regulations may include provisions
24
Req. No. 1426 Page 7

as to the extent to which streets and other ways shall be graded and
1
2
improved and to which water, sewer, and other utility mains, piping,
2
3
or other facilities shall be installed as a condition precedent to
3
4
the approval of the plat. The regulations may provide for a
4
5
tentative approval of the plat before such installation. Any such
5
6
tentative approval shall be revocable for failure to comply with
6
7
commitments upon which the tentative approval was based and shall
7
8
not be entered on the plat. In lieu of the completion of any
8
9
improvements or utilities prior to the final approval of the plat,
9
10
the commission may accept an adequate bond with surety, satisfactory
10
11
to the commission, to secure for the municipality the actual
11
12
construction and installation of the improvements or utilities at a
12
13
time and according to specifications fixed by or in accordance with
13
14
the regulations of the commission, and further conditioned that the
14
15
developer will pay for all material and labor relating to the
15
16
construction of the improvements. The municipality may enforce said
16
17
such bond by all appropriate legal and equitable remedies. Nothing
17
18
in this section shall be construed as granting to any municipality
18
19
or planning commission the power to direct any public utility to
19
20
extend its services to any particular area.
20
21
D. Upon adoption of the regulations governing the subdivision
21
22
of land as provided in subsection C of this section, no plat or deed

23
or other instrument concerning the subdivision of land within the
23
24
corporate limits of a municipality shall be filed with the county

1
clerk until it has been approved by the municipal planning
1
2
commission of that municipality in accordance with the officially
2
3
adopted regulations of subdivisions of that commission. If such
3
4
approval is needed, the approval shall be endorsed on the face of
4
5
the plat, or in the case of a deed or other instrument, in the form
5
6
of a special subdivision certificate. If the adopted regulations
6
7
exempt a certain subdivision of land from the approval requirement,
7
8
the municipal planning commission shall provide to the county clerk
8
9
an exemption statement to accompany the deed or instrument to be

22
23
as utilizing processes, standards, and requirements outlined in the
