8 to the public health, safety, or general welfare of the public in
9 light of objective and relevant facts, or if a zoning decision
10 constitutes an unreasonable, arbitrary exercise of police power.

20 body of the municipality to the district court in the county in
21 which the situs of the municipality is located.
22 B. The appeal shall be taken by filing with the municipal clerk
23 and with the clerk of the board of adjustment, within the time

6 together with the order, decision, or ruling of the board.
7 D. The appeal shall be heard and tried de novo in the district
8 court. All issues in any proceedings under this section shall have
9 preference over all other civil actions and proceedings.
10 E. 1. During the pendency of such an appeal, the effectiveness
11 of a decision of the board of adjustment shall not be suspended
12 unless a party applies to the district court for a stay pending the
13 district court’s determination of the merits of the appeal. Notice
14 of such application shall be given by first class mail to all
15 parties, to the district court appeal, and to any applicant before
16 the board of adjustment. Upon filing of an application for stay in
17 the district court, all proceedings in furtherance of the action
18 appealed from shall be temporarily stayed pending the outcome of a
19 hearing regarding the stay, which shall be conducted within thirty
20 (30) days of application. The Court shall determine whether to
21 impose a stay by considering the following factors: (i)
22 a. the likelihood of success on the merits by the party
23 seeking to impose the stay, (ii)
24
ENGR. S. B. NO. 647 Page 4

1 b. irreparable harm to the property interests of the
2 party seeking to impose the stay if the stay is not
3 imposed, (iii)
4 c. relative effect on the other interested parties, and
5 (iv)
6 d. public policy concerns arising out of the imposition
7 of the stay.
8 2. If the court determines to impose a stay, the court shall
9 require a bond or other security and such other terms as it deems
10 proper to secure the rights of the parties and compensate for costs
11 of delay. A bond or other security shall be posted within ten (10)
12 business days of the court’s determination; provided, that a
13 municipal governing body shall not be required to post a bond.
14 Subject to subsection A of Section 990.3 of Title 12 of the Oklahoma
15 Statutes, a stay pursuant to this subsection shall automatically
16 dissolve after a judgment, decree, or final order resolving the
17 merits of the appeal is filed with the court clerk. Notwithstanding
18 any provision of law to the contrary, stays in appeals from the
19 board of adjustment to the district court shall be obtained only as
20 set forth in this section.
21 F. The district court may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly,
22 or modify the decision brought up for review. Costs shall not be
23 allowed against the board of adjustment unless it shall appear to
24 the district court that the board acted with gross negligence or in
ENGR. S. B. NO. 647 Page 5

1 bad faith or with malice in making the decision appealed from. An
2 appeal shall lie from the action of the district court as in all
3 other civil actions. A party may obtain a stay of the enforcement
4 of the district court’s judgment, decree, or final order as provided
5 by Section 990.4 of Title 12 of the Oklahoma Statutes.
6 G. In any municipality where the governing body does not serve
7 as the board of adjustment, the governing body may, except as
8 otherwise provided by that municipality’s charter, provide that the
9 decisions of the board on matters within its jurisdiction are final
10 subject to judicial review or are final subject to appeal to the
11 governing body and the right of later judicial review or are
12 advisory to the governing body.
13 SECTION 9. AMENDATORY 11 O.S. 2021, Section 45-104, is
14 amended to read as follows:
15 Section 45-104. A. Before final action may be taken by any
16 municipality or department thereof on the location, construction, or
17 design of any public building, statue, memorial, park, parkway,
18 boulevard, street, alley, playground, public ground, or bridge, or
19 the change in the location or grade of any street or alley, the
20 question shall be submitted to the planning commission for
21 investigation and report. Counties and school districts may be
22 exempted from the payment of a fee to obtain any license or permit
23 required by a zoning, building, or similar ordinance of a
24 municipality.
ENGR. S. B. NO. 647 Page 6

1 B. All plans, plats, or replats of land laid out in lots or
2 blocks, and the streets, alleys, or other portions of the same,
3 intended to be dedicated to public or private use, within the
4 corporate limits of a municipality, shall first be submitted to the
5 municipal planning commission for its approval or rejection. Before
6 said the plans, plats, or replats shall be entitled to be recorded
7 in the office of the county clerk, they shall be approved by the
8 municipal governing body. It shall be unlawful to offer and cause
9 to be recorded any such plan, plat, or replat in any public office
10 unless the same shall bear thereon, by endorsement or otherwise, the
11 approval of the municipal governing body. Any plat filed without
12 the endorsed approval of the municipal governing body shall not
13 import notice nor impose any obligation or duties on the
14 municipality. The disapproval of any such plan, plat, or replat by
15 the municipal governing body shall be deemed a refusal of the
16 proposed dedication shown thereon.
17 C. The municipal planning commission may exercise jurisdiction
18 over subdivision of land and adopt regulations governing the
19 subdivision of land within its jurisdiction. Any such regulations,
20 before they become effective, shall be approved by the municipal
21 governing body and shall be published as provided by law for the
22 publication of ordinances. Such regulations may include provisions
23 as to the extent to which streets and other ways shall be graded and
24 improved and to which water, sewer, and other utility mains, piping,
ENGR. S. B. NO. 647 Page 7

1 or o ther facilities shall be installed as a condition precedent to
2 the approval of the plat. The regulations may provide for a
3 tentative approval of the plat before such installation. Any such
4 tentative approval shall be revocable for failure to comply with
5 commitments upon which the tentative approval was based and shall
6 not be entered on the plat. In lieu of the completion of any
7 improvements or utilities prior to the final approval of the plat,
8 the commission may accept an adequate bond with surety, satisfactory
9 to the commission, to secure for the municipality the actual
10 construction and installation of the improvements or utilities at a
11 time and according to specifications fixed by or in accordance with
12 the regulations of the commission, and further conditioned that the
13 developer will pay for all material and labor relating to the
14 construction of the improvements. The municipality may enforce said
15 such bond by all appropriate legal and equitable remedies. Nothing
16 in this section shall be construed as granting to any municipality
17 or planning commission the power to direct any public utility to
18 extend its services to any particular area.
19 D. Upon adoption of the regulations governing the subdivision
20 of land as provided in subsection C of this section, no plat or deed
21 or other instrument concerning the subdivision of land within the
22 corporate limits of a municipality shall be filed with the county
23 clerk until it has been approved by the municipal planning
24 commission of that municipality in accordance with the officially
ENGR. S. B. NO. 647 Page 8

1 adop ted regulations of subdivisions of that commission. If such
2 approval is needed, the approval shall be endorsed on the face of
3 the plat, or in the case of a deed or other instrument, in the form
4 of a special subdivision certificate. If the adopted regulations
5 exempt a certain subdivision of land from the approval requirement,
6 the municipal planning commission shall provide to the county clerk
7 an exemption statement to accompany the deed or instrument to be
8 filed.
9 E. A municipality which contains large areas of rural land not
10 served by water and sewer facilities by the municipality shall
11 authorize the use of private roadways in either platted or unplatted
12 areas and shall issue building permits to property owners whose
13 property is abutting upon the private roadways, without complying
14 with standards as provided for dedicated streets, subject to the
15 following conditions:
16 1. The private roadway easement shall be at least fifty (50)
17 feet in width; and
18 2. The property abutting upon the private roadway shall contain
19 not less than two (2) acres; provided, however, if the covenants of
20 the subdivision allow for Evapotranspiration Absorption Systems
21 evapotranspiration absorption systems or an Aerobic Wastewater
22 Treatment System aerobic wastewater treatment system, the property
23 abutting upon the private roadway may contain not less than one (1)
24 acre; and
ENGR. S. B. NO. 647 Page 9

1 3. The property shall be more than one-fourth (1/4) mile from
2 sewer and water facilities furnished by the municipality; and
3 4. The private roadway shall not be dedicated to the public but
4 reserved for future dedication and, until such future dedication,
5 shall be the private roadway of the owners of the abutting property;
6 and
7 5. The private roadway shall be maintained by the owners of the
8 property within the subdivision; and
9 6. The municipality shall have no responsibility for the
10 maintenance or repair of the private roadway; and
11 7. If the property is platted, there shall be emblematized on
12 the face of the plat, clearly conspicuous, a notice that the streets
13 and drives have not been dedicated to the public and that the
14 streets shall be maintained by the private property owners within
15 the subdivision. Said Such streets shall always be open to police,
16 fire, and other official vehicles of all state, federal, county, and
17 municipal agencies; and
18 8. Every deed shall clearly acknowledge that the roadway is
19 private and not maintained by the municipality; and
20 9. Prior to the sale of any parcel of land in the subdivision,
21 a conspicuous sign shall be posted at the entrance to the
22 subdivision: “Private roadway not maintained by __________ (the
23 municipality)”. At any time after the municipality permits the use
24 of said such private roadway, a petition of the owners of at least
ENGR. S. B. NO. 647 Page 10

1 sixt y percent (60%) of the area of the land to improve and dedicate
2 the street shall bind all of the owners thereby to permanently
3 improve the street or roadway in compliance with the requirements of
4 the municipality; and
5 10. The planning commission may require the developer of such
6 property to reserve appropriate utility easements for water, sewer,
7 and any other utility installations as may be required for present
8 and future development.
9 F. Municipal platting decisions are quasi-judicial in nature.
10 The planning commission and the governing body of a municipality
11 shall have reasonable discretion to determine the compliance of
12 preliminary and final plats with the municipality’s adopted
13 subdivision regulations and all applicable codes and ordinances. If
14 the planning commission and governing body determine the proposed
15 plat is in compliance with the adopted subdivision code, and meets
16 all applicable ordinances, and the governing body and planning
17 commission accept any proposed dedications, if applicable, the plat
18 shall be approved.
19 G. While comprehensive plans may be utilized as a guide in the
20 decision-making process, determinations shall be made using
21 applicable objective and relevant facts as to proposed plats as well
22 as utilizing processes, standards, and requirements outlined in the
23 municipal code. Compliance with comprehensive plans shall not be a
24 requirement for plat approval.
ENGR. S. B. NO. 647 Page 11

1 H. In the case of a preliminary or final plat denial, if
2 requested by the applicant at the meeting on the vote, the city
3 attorney or contracted counsel shall identify on the record the
4 basis for the denial, including at a minimum all of the applicable
5 objective and relevant facts upon which the denial is based.
6 I. The notice and hearing provisions in Sections 43-104 through
7 43-106 of this title, or as otherwise may be applicable, are
8 intended to provide members of the public with a right to be heard,
9 explain how they think their interests are affected, and bring to
10 the attention of the governing body objective and relevant facts.
11 However, decisions on land use applications shall not be based
12 solely upon the presence, numbers, or magnitude of opposition or
13 protests in the absence of objective and relevant facts.
