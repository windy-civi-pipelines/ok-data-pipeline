have ten (10) days after the issuance of the notice to the employer
to provide any additional information to the Tax Commission for the
garnishment of wages to be withdrawn or released by the Tax
Commission. The Tax Commission shall withdraw or adjust the
garnishment for wages upon proof to the satisfaction of the Tax
Commission that the delinquent tax, interest and penalty referred to
in the notice have been paid or the taxpayer can show the wages
subject to garnishment are exempt pursuant to state or federal law.

in the case of refunds due to taxpayers who are required to remit
taxes to the Tax Commission on a monthly or quarterly basis, the Tax
Commission may, in lieu of such refund, credit the account of the
taxpayer for such amount. If current collections from the same

Section 254. A. Upon a hearing with notice the Oklahoma Tax
Commission shall be entitled to proceed by garnishment to collect
any delinquent tax and to collect any penalty or interest due and
owing as a result of a tax delinquency. Provided, that upon proper
application under the procedures outlined herein, the court may
issue an order continuing the garnishment for the collection of
delinquent taxes, penalties or interest until the total amount of
such delinquent taxes, penalties or interest have been collected.
B. The Oklahoma Tax Commission may garnish the accrued earnings
of a delinquent taxpayer employee by sending notice to the
taxpayer's employer. For the purpose of this section, "earnings"
means any form of payment to an individual including, but not
limited to, salary, wages, commission or other compensation, but
does not include reimbursements for travel expenses for state
employees. Such notice may be served by mail or by delivery by a
field agent of the Tax Commission to the taxpayer's employer along
with a copy to the delinquent taxpayer. Upon receipt of such notice
of delinquency, the employer shall withhold from compensation due,
or to become due to the employee, the total amount shown by the
notice. The Tax Commission may direct the employer to withhold part
of the amount due, not to exceed twenty-five percent (25%) of
earnings per pay period, until the total amount as shown by the
notice, plus interest and penalty, has been withheld and remitted to
the Tax Commission. The employer's response and calculation of
amounts withheld shall be on a form prescribed by the Tax
Commission.
C. Within seven (7) days after the end of each pay period, or
if the delinquent taxpayer does not have regular pay periods, within
thirty (30) days from the date of the notice, the employer shall
withhold amounts due or provide an explanation to the Tax Commission
why amounts due will not be withheld and remitted to the Tax
Commission. In any case in which the employee ceases to be employed
by the employer before the full amount set forth in the notice of
delinquency, plus delinquent penalty and interest, has been withheld
by the employer, the employer shall immediately notify the Tax
Commission in writing the date the employee resigned or was
terminated. Any employer who knowingly and willfully refuses to
respond by any means to the notice as provided in subsection B of
this section may be liable for the total amount as set forth in the
notice. The employer may not terminate the delinquent taxpayer
employee based upon the notice of administrative wage garnishment.

and filed pursuant to Section 231 of this title. The taxpayer shall
have ten (10) days after the issuance of the notice to the employer
to provide any additional information to the Tax Commission for the
garnishment of wages to be withdrawn or released by the Tax
Commission. The Tax Commission shall withdraw or adjust the
garnishment for wages upon proof to the satisfaction of the Tax
Commission that the delinquent tax, interest and penalty referred to
in the notice have been paid or the taxpayer can show the wages
subject to garnishment are exempt pursuant to state or federal law.
