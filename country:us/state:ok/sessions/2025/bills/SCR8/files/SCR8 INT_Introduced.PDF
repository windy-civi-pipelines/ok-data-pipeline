AS INTRODUCED
8
9
A Concurrent Resolution recognizing that marriage is
9
between one man and one woman; calling on the Supreme
10
Court of the United States to overturn Obergefell v.
10
Hodges; and directing distribution.
11
11
12
12
13
WHEREAS, the decision by the Supreme Court of the United States
13
14
in Obergefell v. Hodges, 576 U.S. 644 (2015), conflicts with the
14
15
original public meaning of the United States Constitution, the
15
16
principles upon which the United States is established, and the
16
17
deeply rooted history and tradition of the United States regarding
17
18
the nature of marriage and state powers; and
18
19
WHEREAS, in 2004, the people of Oklahoma affirmed State Question
19
20
711, now codified in the Oklahoma Constitution, Article II, Section
20
21
35, with over 75% of Oklahomans voting to recognize marriage as the
21
22
union of one man and one woman, prohibit marriage benefits for
22
23
unmarried individuals, invalidate same-sex marriages from other
23
24
24
Req. No. 2085 Page 1

1
states, and make issuing licenses in violation of subsection C of
1
2
such section a misdemeanor; and
2
3
WHEREAS, liberty is and has long been understood, from
3
4
Blackstone to the Framers to America’s history and tradition until
4
5
2015, as individual freedom from unwarranted governmental intrusion,
5
6
not a right to a particular governmental entitlement as falsely
6
7
asserted in Obergefell; and
7
8
WHEREAS, when the Framers proclaimed in the Declaration of
8
9
Independence that “all men are created equal” and “endowed by their
9
10
Creator with certain unalienable Rights,” they referred to a vision
10
11
of mankind in which all humans are created in the image of God and
11
12
therefore of inherent worth; and
12
13
WHEREAS, Obergefell asserts that governmental licensing of same-
13
14
sex marriage is necessary to confer human dignity, contrary to
14
15
Justice Clarence Thomas’ observation that, first, “the Constitution
15
16
contains no ‘dignity’ Clause,” and second, “even if it did, the
16
17
government would be incapable of bestowing dignity”; and
17
18
WHEREAS, Obergefell abuses the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due
18
19
Process clause to fabricate substantive rights, a practice Justice
19
20
Thomas has frequently urged the court to abandon, including in Dobbs
20
21
v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, 597 U.S. 215 (2022); and
21
22
WHEREAS, Obergefell’s inversion of the natural and true meaning
22
23
of liberty causes collateral damage to other aspects of our
23
24
24
Req. No. 2085 Page 2

1
constitutional order that protect liberty, including religious
1
2
liberty; and
2
3
WHEREAS, the Supreme Court recognized in United States v.
3
4
Windsor, 570 U.S. 744 (2013), that the definition of marriage is “an
4
5
area that has long been regarded as a virtually exclusive province
5
6
of the States,” meaning that Oklahoma, and not the Supreme Court,
6
7
has the right to regulate marriage for its citizens; and
7
8
WHEREAS, Obergefell requires states to license and recognize
8
9
same-sex marriages in complete contravention of their own
9
10
constitutions or electorate, thus undermining the civil liberties of
10
11
those states’ residents and voters without any valid constitutional
11
12
warrant for doing so; and
12
13
WHEREAS, for millennia marriage has been understood, both in
13
14
biblical teaching and in the Anglo-American common-law tradition, as
14
15
the lifelong covenant union of one man and one woman; and
15
16
WHEREAS, Obergefell arbitrarily and unjustly rejected and
16
17
prohibited states from recognizing this definition of marriage in
17
18
favor of its own definition of marriage and a novel, flawed
18
19
interpretation of key clauses within the United States Constitution
19
20
and our nation’s legal and cultural precedents; and
20
21
WHEREAS, the Obergefell decision was illegitimate because two of
21
22
the Justices in the majority ruling, Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg
22
23
and Elena Kagan, had previously officiated same-sex weddings, and
23
24
24
Req. No. 2085 Page 3

1
thus were not impartial triers of fact, and therefore should have
1
2
recused themselves according to 28 U.S.C., Section 455; and
2
3
WHEREAS, Chief Justice John Roberts pointed out that the
3
4
Obergefell decision vilifies people of faith by “portray[ing]
4
5
everyone who does not share the majority’s ‘better informed
5
6
understanding’ as bigoted,” and Justice Samuel Alito wrote similarly
6
7
that the Obergefell decision vilifies people of faith by falsely
7
8
comparing those who recognize that marriage is between a man and a
8
9
woman to those who oppose interracial marriage, a comparison now
9
10
frequently weaponized against people of faith; and
10
11
WHEREAS, the Obergefell decision has resulted in litigation
11
12
directly targeting Christians, such as Colorado baker Jack Phillips
12
13
and Washington florist Barronelle Stutzman, for adhering to the
13
14
historic definition of marriage; and
14
15
WHEREAS, by declaring sex differences legally irrelevant to
15
16
marriage, Obergefell played a role in erasing biological
16
17
distinctions in other arenas, threatening women’s privacy, safety,
17
18
and athletic opportunities; and
18
19
WHEREAS, in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization (2022),
19
20
the Supreme Court restored to the states authority over areas “the
20
21
Constitution does not prohibit the states from regulating,” thereby
21
22
inviting reconsideration of Obergefell on the same federalism
22
23
grounds.
