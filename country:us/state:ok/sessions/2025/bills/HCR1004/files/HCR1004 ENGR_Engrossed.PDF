13 WHEREAS, the Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance
14 Abuse Services is obligated to provide competency evaluations and
15 restoration treatment for persons found incompetent to stand trial
16 in Oklahoma state court criminal proceedings; and
17 WHEREAS, when an Oklahoma state court determines that a person
18 is incompetent to stand trial because he or she is a "person
19 requiring treatment", but capable of achieving competency with
20 treatment within a reasonable period of time, the state court must
21 suspend the criminal proceedings and order the Department, or its
22 designee, to provide treatment, therapy, or training calculated to
23 allow the person to achieve competency; and

1 WHEREAS, the Oklahoma Forensic Center is currently the only
2 Department-operated hospital that provides secure, in-patient
3 competency restoration treatment in Oklahoma; and
4 WHEREAS, on March 1, 2023, the putative class filed a class
5 action lawsuit pursuant to 42 U.S.C., Section 1983 against the
6 Commissioner of the Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse
7 Services and the Executive Director of the Oklahoma Forensic Center;
8 and
9 WHEREAS, the parties have entered into a consent decree pursuant
10 to case number 23-cv-81-GKF-JFJ filed in the United States District
11 Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma; and
12 WHEREAS, the parties acknowledge that plaintiffs' claims and
13 allegations are serious and credible and the consent decree resolves
14 plaintiffs' claims while avoiding the costs, uncertainties, and
15 risks of protracted litigation, likely saving the Department
16 millions of dollars in legal fees and expenses if the case were
17 litigated to a conclusion.
