2 of child abuse, domestic violence, harassing or stalking behavior is
3 detrimental and not in the best interest of the child, and it is in

5 a perpetrator of child abuse, domestic violence, harassing or
6 stalking behavior.
7 2. For the purposes of this subsection:

17 the household including coercive control by a parent
18 involving physical, sexual, psychological, emotional,
19 economic or financial abuse,

6 person as defined in Section 1173 of Title 21 of the
7 Oklahoma Statutes.

9 domestic violence by the other parent, the absence or relocation
10 shall not be a factor that weighs against the parent in determining
11 custody or visitation.
12 4. The court shall consider, as a primary factor, the safety
13 and well-being of the child who is the victim of child abuse and of
14 the parent who is the victim of domestic violence, harassment, or
15 stalking behavior, in addition to other facts regarding the best
16 interest of the child.
17 5. The court shall consider the history of the parent causing
18 physical harm, bodily injury, assault, verbal threats, stalking, or
19 harassing behavior, or the fear of physical harm, bodily injury, or
