12 5. The net income or loss remaining after the separate
13 allocation in paragraph 4 of this subsection, being that which is
14 derived from a unitary business enterprise, shall be apportioned to
15 this state on the basis of the arithmetical average of three factors
16 consisting of property, payroll and sales or gross revenue
17 enumerated as subparagraphs a, b and c of this paragraph. Net
18 income or loss as used in this paragraph includes that derived from
19 patent or copyright royalties, purchase discounts, and interest on
20 accounts receivable relating to or arising from a business activity,
21 the income from which is apportioned pursuant to this subsection,

23 other property used in the unitary enterprise. Deductions used in
24 computing such net income or loss shall not include taxes based on
SB304 HFLR Page 20

1 or m easured by income. Provided, for corporations whose property
2 for purposes of the tax imposed by Section 2355 of this title has an
3 initial investment cost equaling or exceeding Two Hundred Million
4 Dollars ($200,000,000.00) and such investment is made on or after
5 July 1, 1997, or for corporations which expand their property or
6 facilities in this state and such expansion has an investment cost
7 equaling or exceeding Two Hundred Million Dollars ($200,000,000.00)
8 over a period not to exceed three (3) years, and such expansion is
9 commenced on or after January 1, 2000, the three factors shall be
10 apportioned with property and payroll, each comprising twenty-five
11 percent (25%) of the apportionment factor and sales comprising fifty
12 percent (50%) of the apportionment factor. The apportionment
13 factors shall be computed as follows:
14 a. The property factor is a fraction, the numerator of
15 which is the average value of the taxpayer’s real and
16 tangible personal property owned or rented and used in
17 this state during the tax period and the denominator
18 of which is the average value of all the taxpayer’s
19 real and tangible personal property everywhere owned
20 or rented and used during the tax period.
21 (1) Property, the income from which is separately
22 allocated in paragraph 4 of this subsection,
23 shall not be included in determining this
24 fraction. The numerator of the fraction shall
SB304 HFLR Page 21
BOLD FACE denotes Committee Amendments.
1 include a portion of the investment in
2 transportation and other equipment having no
3 fixed situs, such as rolling stock, buses, trucks
4 and trailers, including machinery and equipment
5 carried thereon, airplanes, salespersons’
6 automobiles and other similar equipment, in the
7 proportion that miles traveled in Oklahoma this
8 state by such equipment bears to total miles
9 traveled,
10 (2) Property owned by the taxpayer is valued at its
11 original cost. Property rented by the taxpayer
12 is valued at eight times the net annual rental
13 rate. Net annual rental rate is the annual
14 rental rate paid by the taxpayer, less any annual
15 rental rate received by the taxpayer from
16 subrentals,
17 (3) The average value of property shall be determined
18 by averaging the values at the beginning and
19 ending of the tax period but the Oklahoma Tax
20 Commission may require the averaging of monthly
21 values during the tax period if reasonably
22 required to reflect properly the average value of
23 the taxpayer’s property;
24
SB304 HFLR Page 22
BOLD FACE denotes Committee Amendments.
1 b. The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of
2 which is the total compensation for services rendered
3 in the state during the tax period, and the
4 denominator of which is the total compensation for
5 services rendered everywhere during the tax period.
6 “Compensation”, as used in this subsection, means
7 those paid-for services to the extent related to the
8 unitary business but does not include officers’
9 salaries, wages and other compensation.
10 (1) In the case of a transportation enterprise, the
11 numerator of the fraction shall include a portion
12 of such expenditure in connection with employees
13 operating equipment over a fixed route, such as
14 railroad employees, airline pilots, or bus
15 drivers, in this state only a part of the time,
16 in the proportion that mileage traveled in
17 Oklahoma this state bears to total mileage
18 traveled by such employees,
19 (2) In any case the numerator of the fraction shall
20 include a portion of such expenditures in
21 connection with itinerant employees, such as
22 traveling salespersons, in this state only a part
23 of the time, in the proportion that time spent in
24
SB304 HFLR Page 23
BOLD FACE denotes Committee Amendments.
1 Oklahoma this state bears to total time spent in
2 furtherance of the enterprise by such employees;
3 c. The sales factor is a fraction, the numerator of which
4 is the total sales or gross revenue of the taxpayer in
5 this state during the tax period, and the denominator
6 of which is the total sales or gross revenue of the
7 taxpayer everywhere during the tax period. “Sales”,
8 as used in this subsection, does not include sales or
9 gross revenue which are separately allocated in
10 paragraph 4 of this subsection.
11 (1) Sales of tangible personal property have a situs
12 in this state if the property is delivered or
13 shipped to a purchaser other than the United
14 States government, within this state regardless
15 of the FOB Freight on Board (FOB) point or other
16 conditions of the sale; or the property is
17 shipped from an office, store, warehouse, factory
18 or other place of storage in this state and (a)
19 the purchaser is the United States government or
20 (b) the taxpayer is not doing business in the
21 state of the destination of the shipment.
22 (2) In the case of a railroad or interurban railway
23 enterprise, the numerator of the fraction shall
24 not be less than the allocation of revenues to
SB304 HFLR Page 24
BOLD FACE denotes Committee Amendments.
1 this state as shown in its annual report to the
2 Corporation Commission.
3 (3) In the case of an airline, truck or bus
4 enterprise or freight car, tank car, refrigerator
5 car or other railroad equipment enterprise, the
6 numerator of the fraction shall include a portion
7 of revenue from interstate transportation in the
8 proportion that interstate mileage traveled in
9 Oklahoma this state bears to total interstate
10 mileage traveled.
11 (4) In the case of an oil, gasoline or gas pipeline
12 enterprise, the numerator of the fraction shall
13 be either the total of traffic units of the
14 enterprise within Oklahoma this state or the
15 revenue allocated to Oklahoma this state based
16 upon miles moved, at the option of the taxpayer,
17 and the denominator of which shall be the total
18 of traffic units of the enterprise or the revenue
19 of the enterprise everywhere as appropriate to
20 the numerator. A “traffic unit” is hereby
21 defined as the transportation for a distance of
22 one (1) mile of one (1) barrel of oil, one (1)
23 gallon of gasoline or one thousand (1,000) cubic
24
SB304 HFLR Page 25
BOLD FACE denotes Committee Amendments.
1 feet of natural or casinghead gas, as the case
2 may be.
3 (5) In the case of a telephone or telegraph or other
4 communication enterprise, the numerator of the
5 fraction shall include that portion of the
6 interstate revenue as is allocated pursuant to
7 the accounting procedures prescribed by the
8 Federal Communications Commission; provided that
9 in respect to each corporation or business entity
10 required by the Federal Communications Commission
11 to keep its books and records in accordance with
12 a uniform system of accounts prescribed by such
13 Commission, the intrastate net income shall be
14 determined separately in the manner provided by
15 such uniform system of accounts and only the
16 interstate income shall be subject to allocation
17 pursuant to the provisions of this subsection.
18 Provided further, that the gross revenue factors
19 shall be those as are determined pursuant to the
20 accounting procedures prescribed by the Federal
21 Communications Commission.
22 In any case where the apportionment of the three factors
23 prescribed in this paragraph attributes to Oklahoma this state a
24 portion of net income of the enterprise out of all appropriate
SB304 HFLR Page 26
BOLD FACE denotes Committee Amendments.
1 prop ortion to the property owned and/or business transacted within
2 this state, because of the fact that one or more of the factors so
3 prescribed are not employed to any appreciable extent in furtherance
4 of the enterprise; or because one or more factors not so prescribed
5 are employed to a considerable extent in furtherance of the
6 enterprise; or because of other reasons, the Tax Commission is
7 empowered to permit, after a showing by taxpayer that an excessive
8 portion of net income has been attributed to Oklahoma this state, or
9 require, when in its judgment an insufficient portion of net income
10 has been attributed to Oklahoma this state, the elimination,
11 substitution, or use of additional factors, or reduction or increase
12 in the weight of such prescribed factors. Provided, however, that
13 any such variance from such prescribed factors which has the effect
14 of increasing the portion of net income attributable to Oklahoma
15 this state must not be inherently arbitrary, and application of the
16 recomputed final apportionment to the net income of the enterprise
17 must attribute to Oklahoma this state only a reasonable portion
18 thereof.
19 6. For calendar years 1997 and 1998, the owner of a new or
20 expanded agricultural commodity processing facility in this state
21 may exclude from Oklahoma taxable income, or in the case of an
22 individual, the Oklahoma adjusted gross income, fifteen percent
23 (15%) of the investment by the owner in the new or expanded
24 agricultural commodity processing facility. For calendar year 1999,
SB304 HFLR Page 27
BOLD FACE denotes Committee Amendments.
1 and all subsequent years, the percentage, not to exceed fifteen
2 percent (15%), available to the owner of a new or expanded
3 agricultural commodity processing facility in this state claiming
4 the exemption shall be adjusted annually so that the total estimated
5 reduction in tax liability does not exceed One Million Dollars
6 ($1,000,000.00) annually. The Tax Commission shall promulgate rules
7 for determining the percentage of the investment which each eligible
8 taxpayer may exclude. The exclusion provided by this paragraph
9 shall be taken in the taxable year when the investment is made. In
10 the event the total reduction in tax liability authorized by this
11 paragraph exceeds One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) in any
12 calendar year, the Tax Commission shall permit any excess over One
13 Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) and shall factor such excess into
14 the percentage for subsequent years. Any amount of the exemption
15 permitted to be excluded pursuant to the provisions of this
16 paragraph but not used in any year may be carried forward as an
17 exemption from income pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph
18 for a period not exceeding six (6) years following the year in which
19 the investment was originally made.
20 For purposes of this paragraph:
21 a. “Agricultural commodity processing facility” means

6 (2) if the principal source of premiums written by an
7 insurance company consists of premiums for
8 reinsurance accepted by it, the taxable income of
9 such company shall be apportioned to this state
10 by multiplying such income by a fraction, the
11 numerator of which is the sum of (a) direct
12 premiums written for insurance on property or
13 risks in this state, plus (b) premiums written
14 for reinsurance accepted in respect of property
15 or risks in this state, and the denominator of

7 premiums written for insurance on property or
8 risks in this state by each ceding company from
9 which reinsurance is accepted bears to the sum of
10 the total direct premiums written by each such
11 ceding company for the taxable year.
12 5. The net income or loss remaining after the separate
13 allocation in paragraph 4 of this subsection, being that which is
14 derived from a unitary business enterprise, shall be apportioned to
15 this state on the basis of the arithmetical average of three factors

18 income or loss as used in this paragraph includes that derived from
19 patent or copyright royalties, purchase discounts, and interest on

1 or m easured by income. Provided, for corporations whose property
2 for purposes of the tax imposed by Section 2355 of this title has an
3 initial investment cost equaling or exceeding Two Hundred Million
4 Dollars ($200,000,000.00) and such investment is made on or after
5 July 1, 1997, or for corporations which expand their property or
6 facilities in this state and such expansion has an investment cost
7 equaling or exceeding Two Hundred Million Dollars ($200,000,000.00)
8 over a period not to exceed three (3) years, and such expansion is
9 commenced on or after January 1, 2000, the three factors shall be
10 apportioned with property and payroll, each comprising twenty-five
11 percent (25%) of the apportionment factor and sales comprising fifty
12 percent (50%) of the apportionment factor. The apportionment
13 factors shall be computed as follows:
14 a. The property factor is a fraction, the numerator of
15 which is the average value of the taxpayer’s real and
16 tangible personal property owned or rented and used in
17 this state during the tax period and the denominator
18 of which is the average value of all the taxpayer’s
19 real and tangible personal property everywhere owned
20 or rented and used during the tax period.
21 (1) Property, the income from which is separately
22 allocated in paragraph 4 of this subsection,
23 shall not be included in determining this
24 fraction. The numerator of the fraction shall

1 include a portion of the investment in
2 transportation and other equipment having no
3 fixed situs, such as rolling stock, buses, trucks
4 and trailers, including machinery and equipment
5 carried thereon, airplanes, salespersons’
6 automobiles and other similar equipment, in the
7 proportion that miles traveled in Oklahoma this
8 state by such equipment bears to total miles
9 traveled,
10 (2) Property owned by the taxpayer is valued at its
11 original cost. Property rented by the taxpayer
12 is valued at eight times the net annual rental
13 rate. Net annual rental rate is the annual
14 rental rate paid by the taxpayer, less any annual
15 rental rate received by the taxpayer from
16 subrentals,
17 (3) The average value of property shall be determined
18 by averaging the values at the beginning and
19 ending of the tax period but the Oklahoma Tax
20 Commission may require the averaging of monthly
21 values during the tax period if reasonably
22 required to reflect properly the average value of
23 the taxpayer’s property;
24
SB304 HFLR Page 22
BOLD FACE denotes Committee Amendments.

1 b. The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of
2 which is the total compensation for services rendered
3 in the state during the tax period, and the
4 denominator of which is the total compensation for
5 services rendered everywhere during the tax period.
6 “Compensation”, as used in this subsection, means
7 those paid-for services to the extent related to the
8 unitary business but does not include officers’
9 salaries, wages and other compensation.
10 (1) In the case of a transportation enterprise, the
11 numerator of the fraction shall include a portion
12 of such expenditure in connection with employees
13 operating equipment over a fixed route, such as
14 railroad employees, airline pilots, or bus
15 drivers, in this state only a part of the time,
16 in the proportion that mileage traveled in
17 Oklahoma this state bears to total mileage
18 traveled by such employees,
19 (2) In any case the numerator of the fraction shall
20 include a portion of such expenditures in
21 connection with itinerant employees, such as
22 traveling salespersons, in this state only a part
23 of the time, in the proportion that time spent in
24
SB304 HFLR Page 23

1 Oklahoma this state bears to total time spent in
2 furtherance of the enterprise by such employees;
3 c. The sales factor is a fraction, the numerator of which
4 is the total sales or gross revenue of the taxpayer in
5 this state during the tax period, and the denominator
6 of which is the total sales or gross revenue of the
7 taxpayer everywhere during the tax period. “Sales”,
8 as used in this subsection, does not include sales or
9 gross revenue which are separately allocated in
10 paragraph 4 of this subsection.
11 (1) Sales of tangible personal property have a situs
12 in this state if the property is delivered or

13 any such variance from such prescribed factors which has the effect
14 of increasing the portion of net income attributable to Oklahoma
15 this state must not be inherently arbitrary, and application of the
