20
derived from a unitary business enterprise, shall be apportioned to

over a period not to exceed three (3) years, and such expansion is

16
apportioned with property and payroll, each comprising twenty-five
16
17
percent (25%) of the apportionment factor and sales comprising fifty
17
18
percent (50%) of the apportionment factor. The apportionment
18
19
factors shall be computed as follows:
19
20
a. The property factor is a fraction, the numerator of
20
21
which is the average value of the taxpayer’s real and
21
22
tangible personal property owned or rented and used in
22
23
this state during the tax period and the denominator
23
24
of which is the average value of all the taxpayer’s
24
Req. No. 77 Page 21

real and tangible personal property everywhere owned
1
2
or rented and used during the tax period.

3
(1) Property, the income from which is separately
3

9
fixed situs, such as rolling stock, buses, trucks
9
10
and trailers, including machinery and equipment
10
11
carried thereon, airplanes, salespersons’
11
12
automobiles and other similar equipment, in the
12
13
proportion that miles traveled in Oklahoma this
13
14
state by such equipment bears to total miles
14
15
traveled,
15
16
(2) Property owned by the taxpayer is valued at its
16
17
original cost. Property rented by the taxpayer
17
18
is valued at eight times the net annual rental
18
19
rate. Net annual rental rate is the annual
19
20
rental rate paid by the taxpayer, less any annual
20
21
rental rate received by the taxpayer from
21
22
subrentals,
22
23
(3) The average value of property shall be determined
23
24
by averaging the values at the beginning and
24
Req. No. 77 Page 22

1
ending of the tax period but the Oklahoma Tax
1
2
Commission may require the averaging of monthly
2

values during the tax period if reasonably

required to reflect properly the average value of
4
5
the taxpayer’s property;
5
6
b. The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of
6
7
which is the total compensation for services rendered
7
8
in the state during the tax period, and the
8
9
denominator of which is the total compensation for
9
10
services rendered everywhere during the tax period.
10
11
“Compensation”, as used in this subsection, means
11
12
those paid-for services to the extent related to the
12
13
unitary business but does not include officers’
13
14
salaries, wages and other compensation.
14
15
(1) In the case of a transportation enterprise, the
15
16
numerator of the fraction shall include a portion
16
17
of such expenditure in connection with employees
17
18
operating equipment over a fixed route, such as
18
19
railroad employees, airline pilots, or bus
19
20
drivers, in this state only a part of the time,
20
21
in the proportion that mileage traveled in
21
22
Oklahoma this state bears to total mileage
22
23
traveled by such employees,
23
24
24
Req. No. 77 Page 23

(2) In any case the numerator of the fraction shall
1
2
include a portion of such expenditures in
2
3
connection with itinerant employees, such as
3
4
traveling salespersons, in this state only a part
4
5
of the time, in the proportion that time spent in
5
6
Oklahoma this state bears to total time spent in
6
7
furtherance of the enterprise by such employees;
7
8
c. The sales factor is a fraction, the numerator of which
8
9
is the total sales or gross revenue of the taxpayer in
9
10
this state during the tax period, and the denominator
10
11
of which is the total sales or gross revenue of the
11
12
taxpayer everywhere during the tax period. “Sales”,
12
13
as used in this subsection, does not include sales or
13
14
gross revenue which are separately allocated in
14
15
paragraph 4 of this subsection.
15
16
(1) Sales of tangible personal property have a situs
16
17
in this state if the property is delivered or
17
18
shipped to a purchaser other than the United
18
19
States government, within this state regardless
19
20
of the FOB Freight on Board (FOB) point or other
20
21
conditions of the sale; or the property is
21
22
shipped from an office, store, warehouse, factory
22
23
or other place of storage in this state and (a)
23
24
the purchaser is the United States government or

5
not be less than the allocation of revenues to
5
6
this state as shown in its annual report to the
6
7
Corporation Commission.
7
8
(3) In the case of an airline, truck or bus
8
9
enterprise or freight car, tank car, refrigerator

car or other railroad equipment enterprise, the

11
numerator of the fraction shall include a portion
11
12
of revenue from interstate transportation in the
12
13
proportion that interstate mileage traveled in
13
14
Oklahoma this state bears to total interstate
14
15
mileage traveled.
15
16
(4) In the case of an oil, gasoline or gas pipeline
16
17
enterprise, the numerator of the fraction shall
17
18
be either the total of traffic units of the
18
19
enterprise within Oklahoma this state or the
19
20
revenue allocated to Oklahoma this state based
20
21
upon miles moved, at the option of the taxpayer,
21
22
and the denominator of which shall be the total
22
23
of traffic units of the enterprise or the revenue
23
24
of the enterprise everywhere as appropriate to

defined as the transportation for a distance of

one (1) mile of one (1) barrel of oil, one (1)
3

gallon of gasoline or one thousand (1,000) cubic

may be.

(5) In the case of a telephone or telegraph or other
7
8
communication enterprise, the numerator of the
8
9
fraction shall include that portion of the
9
10
interstate revenue as is allocated pursuant to
10
11
the accounting procedures prescribed by the
11
12
Federal Communications Commission; provided that
12
13
in respect to each corporation or business entity
13
14
required by the Federal Communications Commission
14
15
to keep its books and records in accordance with
15
16
a uniform system of accounts prescribed by such
16
17
Commission, the intrastate net income shall be
17
18
determined separately in the manner provided by
18
19
such uniform system of accounts and only the
19
20
interstate income shall be subject to allocation
20
21
pursuant to the provisions of this subsection.
21
22
Provided further, that the gross revenue factors
22

3
In any case where the apportionment of the three factors
3
4
prescribed in this paragraph attributes to Oklahoma this state a
4
5
portion of net income of the enterprise out of all appropriate
5
6
proportion to the property owned and/or business transacted within
6
7
this state, because of the fact that one or more of the factors so
7
8
prescribed are not employed to any appreciable extent in furtherance
8
9
of the enterprise; or because one or more factors not so prescribed
9
10
are employed to a considerable extent in furtherance of the
10
11
enterprise; or because of other reasons, the Tax Commission is
11
12
empowered to permit, after a showing by taxpayer that an excessive
12
13
portion of net income has been attributed to Oklahoma this state, or
13
14
require, when in its judgment an insufficient portion of net income
14
15
has been attributed to Oklahoma this state, the elimination,
15
16
substitution, or use of additional factors, or reduction or increase
16
17
in the weight of such prescribed factors. Provided, however, that
17
18
any such variance from such prescribed factors which has the effect
18
19
of increasing the portion of net income attributable to Oklahoma
19
20
this state must not be inherently arbitrary, and application of the
20
21
recomputed final apportionment to the net income of the enterprise
21
22
must attribute to Oklahoma this state only a reasonable portion
22
23
thereof.
