7 5. The net income or loss remaining after the separate
8 allocation in paragraph 4 of this subsection, being that which is

12 enumerated as subparagraphs a, b and c of this paragraph. Net
13 income or loss as used in this paragraph includes that derived from
14 patent or copyright royalties, purchase discounts, and interest on

3 over a period not to exceed three (3) years, and such expansion is
4 commenced on or after January 1, 2000, the three factors shall be
5 apportioned with property and payroll, each comprising twenty-five
6 percent (25%) of the apportionment factor and sales comprising fifty
7 percent (50%) of the apportionment factor. The apportionment
8 factors shall be computed as follows:
9 a. The property factor is a fraction, the numerator of
10 which is the average value of the taxpayer’s real and
11 tangible personal property owned or rented and used in
12 this state during the tax period and the denominator
13 of which is the average value of all the taxpayer’s
14 real and tangible personal property everywhere owned
15 or rented and used during the tax period.
16 (1) Property, the income from which is separately
17 allocated in paragraph 4 of this subsection,
18 shall not be included in determining this
19 fraction. The numerator of the fraction shall
20 include a portion of the investment in

22 fixed situs, such as rolling stock, buses, trucks
23 and trailers, including machinery and equipment
24 carried thereon, airplanes, salespersons’

1 automobiles and other similar equipment, in the
2 proportion that miles traveled in Oklahoma this
3 state by such equipment bears to total miles
4 traveled,
5 (2) Property owned by the taxpayer is valued at its
6 original cost. Property rented by the taxpayer
7 is valued at eight times the net annual rental
8 rate. Net annual rental rate is the annual
9 rental rate paid by the taxpayer, less any annual
10 rental rate received by the taxpayer from
11 subrentals,
12 (3) The average value of property shall be determined
13 by averaging the values at the beginning and
14 ending of the tax period but the Oklahoma Tax
15 Commission may require the averaging of monthly
16 values during the tax period if reasonably
17 required to reflect properly the average value of
18 the taxpayer’s property;
19 b. The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of
20 which is the total compensation for services rendered
21 in the state during the tax period, and the
22 denominator of which is the total compensation for
23 services rendered everywhere during the tax period.
24 “Compensation”, as used in this subsection, means
SENATE FLOOR VERSION - SB304 SFLR Page 22
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)

1 those paid-for services to the extent related to the
2 unitary business but does not include officers’
3 salaries, wages and other compensation.
4 (1) In the case of a transportation enterprise, the
5 numerator of the fraction shall include a portion
6 of such expenditure in connection with employees
7 operating equipment over a fixed route, such as
8 railroad employees, airline pilots, or bus
9 drivers, in this state only a part of the time,
10 in the proportion that mileage traveled in
11 Oklahoma this state bears to total mileage
12 traveled by such employees,
13 (2) In any case the numerator of the fraction shall
14 include a portion of such expenditures in
15 connection with itinerant employees, such as
16 traveling salespersons, in this state only a part
17 of the time, in the proportion that time spent in
18 Oklahoma this state bears to total time spent in
19 furtherance of the enterprise by such employees;
20 c. The sales factor is a fraction, the numerator of which
21 is the total sales or gross revenue of the taxpayer in
22 this state during the tax period, and the denominator
23 of which is the total sales or gross revenue of the
24 taxpayer everywhere during the tax period. “Sales”,
SENATE FLOOR VERSION - SB304 SFLR Page 23
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)

1 as used in this subsection, does not include sales or
2 gross revenue which are separately allocated in
3 paragraph 4 of this subsection.
4 (1) Sales of tangible personal property have a situs
5 in this state if the property is delivered or
6 shipped to a purchaser other than the United
7 States government, within this state regardless
8 of the FOB Freight on Board (FOB) point or other
9 conditions of the sale; or the property is
10 shipped from an office, store, warehouse, factory
11 or other place of storage in this state and (a)
12 the purchaser is the United States government or
13 (b) the taxpayer is not doing business in the
14 state of the destination of the shipment.
15 (2) In the case of a railroad or interurban railway
16 enterprise, the numerator of the fraction shall
17 not be less than the allocation of revenues to
18 this state as shown in its annual report to the
19 Corporation Commission.
20 (3) In the case of an airline, truck or bus
21 enterprise or freight car, tank car, refrigerator
22 car or other railroad equipment enterprise, the
23 numerator of the fraction shall include a portion
24 of revenue from interstate transportation in the
SENATE FLOOR VERSION - SB304 SFLR Page 24
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)

1 proportion that interstate mileage traveled in
2 Oklahoma this state bears to total interstate
3 mileage traveled.
4 (4) In the case of an oil, gasoline or gas pipeline
5 enterprise, the numerator of the fraction shall
6 be either the total of traffic units of the
7 enterprise within Oklahoma this state or the
8 revenue allocated to Oklahoma this state based
9 upon miles moved, at the option of the taxpayer,
10 and the denominator of which shall be the total
11 of traffic units of the enterprise or the revenue
12 of the enterprise everywhere as appropriate to
13 the numerator. A “traffic unit” is hereby
14 defined as the transportation for a distance of
15 one (1) mile of one (1) barrel of oil, one (1)
16 gallon of gasoline or one thousand (1,000) cubic
17 feet of natural or casinghead gas, as the case
18 may be.
19 (5) In the case of a telephone or telegraph or other
20 communication enterprise, the numerator of the
21 fraction shall include that portion of the
22 interstate revenue as is allocated pursuant to
23 the accounting procedures prescribed by the
24 Federal Communications Commission; provided that
SENATE FLOOR VERSION - SB304 SFLR Page 25
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)

1 in respect to each corporation or business entity
2 required by the Federal Communications Commission
3 to keep its books and records in accordance with
4 a uniform system of accounts prescribed by such
5 Commission, the intrastate net income shall be
6 determined separately in the manner provided by
7 such uniform system of accounts and only the
8 interstate income shall be subject to allocation
9 pursuant to the provisions of this subsection.
10 Provided further, that the gross revenue factors
11 shall be those as are determined pursuant to the
12 accounting procedures prescribed by the Federal
13 Communications Commission.
14 In any case where the apportionment of the three factors
15 prescribed in this paragraph attributes to Oklahoma this state a
16 portion of net income of the enterprise out of all appropriate
17 proportion to the property owned and/or business transacted within
18 this state, because of the fact that one or more of the factors so
19 prescribed are not employed to any appreciable extent in furtherance
20 of the enterprise; or because one or more factors not so prescribed
21 are employed to a considerable extent in furtherance of the
22 enterprise; or because of other reasons, the Tax Commission is
23 empowered to permit, after a showing by taxpayer that an excessive
24 portion of net income has been attributed to Oklahoma this state, or
SENATE FLOOR VERSION - SB304 SFLR Page 26
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)

1 requ ire, when in its judgment an insufficient portion of net income
2 has been attributed to Oklahoma this state, the elimination,
3 substitution, or use of additional factors, or reduction or increase
4 in the weight of such prescribed factors. Provided, however, that
5 any such variance from such prescribed factors which has the effect
6 of increasing the portion of net income attributable to Oklahoma
7 this state must not be inherently arbitrary, and application of the
8 recomputed final apportionment to the net income of the enterprise
9 must attribute to Oklahoma this state only a reasonable portion
10 thereof.
11 6. For calendar years 1997 and 1998, the owner of a new or
12 expanded agricultural commodity processing facility in this state
13 may exclude from Oklahoma taxable income, or in the case of an
14 individual, the Oklahoma adjusted gross income, fifteen percent
15 (15%) of the investment by the owner in the new or expanded
16 agricultural commodity processing facility. For calendar year 1999,
17 and all subsequent years, the percentage, not to exceed fifteen
18 percent (15%), available to the owner of a new or expanded
19 agricultural commodity processing facility in this state claiming
20 the exemption shall be adjusted annually so that the total estimated
21 reduction in tax liability does not exceed One Million Dollars
22 ($1,000,000.00) annually. The Tax Commission shall promulgate rules
23 for determining the percentage of the investment which each eligible
24 taxpayer may exclude. The exclusion provided by this paragraph
SENATE FLOOR VERSION - SB304 SFLR Page 27
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)

1 shal l be taken in the taxable year when the investment is made. In
2 the event the total reduction in tax liability authorized by this
3 paragraph exceeds One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) in any
4 calendar year, the Tax Commission shall permit any excess over One
5 Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) and shall factor such excess into
6 the percentage for subsequent years. Any amount of the exemption
7 permitted to be excluded pursuant to the provisions of this
8 paragraph but not used in any year may be carried forward as an
9 exemption from income pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph
10 for a period not exceeding six (6) years following the year in which
11 the investment was originally made.
12 For purposes of this paragraph:
