24 enumerated as subparagraphs a, b and c of this paragraph. Net
Req. No. 1747 Page 20
1 inco me or loss as used in this paragraph includes that derived from
2 patent or copyright royalties, purchase discounts, and interest on
3 accounts receivable relating to or arising from a business activity,
4 the income from which is apportioned pursuant to this subsection,
5 including the sale or other disposition of such property and any
6 other property used in the unitary enterprise. Deductions used in
7 computing such net income or loss shall not include taxes based on
8 or measured by income. Provided, for corporations whose property
9 for purposes of the tax imposed by Section 2355 of this title has an
10 initial investment cost equaling or exceeding Two Hundred Million
11 Dollars ($200,000,000.00) and such investment is made on or after
12 July 1, 1997, or for corporations which expand their property or
13 facilities in this state and such expansion has an investment cost
14 equaling or exceeding Two Hundred Million Dollars ($200,000,000.00)
15 over a period not to exceed three (3) years, and such expansion is
16 commenced on or after January 1, 2000, the three factors shall be
17 apportioned with property and payroll, each comprising twenty-five
18 percent (25%) of the apportionment factor and sales comprising fifty
19 percent (50%) of the apportionment factor. The apportionment
20 factors shall be computed as follows:
21 a. The property factor is a fraction, the numerator of
22 which is the average value of the taxpayer’s real and
23 tangible personal property owned or rented and used in
24 this state during the tax period and the denominator
Req. No. 1747 Page 21
1 of which is the average value of all the taxpayer’s
2 real and tangible personal property everywhere owned
3 or rented and used during the tax period.
4 (1) Property, the income from which is separately
5 allocated in paragraph 4 of this subsection,
6 shall not be included in determining this
7 fraction. The numerator of the fraction shall
8 include a portion of the investment in
9 transportation and other equipment having no
10 fixed situs, such as rolling stock, buses, trucks
11 and trailers, including machinery and equipment
12 carried thereon, airplanes, salespersons’

14 proportion that miles traveled in Oklahoma this
15 state by such equipment bears to total miles
16 traveled,
17 (2) Property owned by the taxpayer is valued at its
18 original cost. Property rented by the taxpayer
19 is valued at eight times the net annual rental
20 rate. Net annual rental rate is the annual
21 rental rate paid by the taxpayer, less any annual
22 rental rate received by the taxpayer from
23 subrentals,
24
Req. No. 1747 Page 22
1 (3) The average value of property shall be determined
2 by averaging the values at the beginning and
3 ending of the tax period but the Oklahoma Tax
4 Commission may require the averaging of monthly
5 values during the tax period if reasonably
6 required to reflect properly the average value of
7 the taxpayer’s property;
8 b. The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of
9 which is the total compensation for services rendered
10 in the state during the tax period, and the
11 denominator of which is the total compensation for
12 services rendered everywhere during the tax period.
13 “Compensation”, as used in this subsection, means
14 those paid-for services to the extent related to the
15 unitary business but does not include officers’
16 salaries, wages and other compensation.
17 (1) In the case of a transportation enterprise, the
18 numerator of the fraction shall include a portion
19 of such expenditure in connection with employees
20 operating equipment over a fixed route, such as
21 railroad employees, airline pilots, or bus
22 drivers, in this state only a part of the time,
23 in the proportion that mileage traveled in
24
Req. No. 1747 Page 23
1 Oklahoma this state bears to total mileage
2 traveled by such employees,
3 (2) In any case the numerator of the fraction shall
4 include a portion of such expenditures in
5 connection with itinerant employees, such as
6 traveling salespersons, in this state only a part
7 of the time, in the proportion that time spent in
8 Oklahoma this state bears to total time spent in
9 furtherance of the enterprise by such employees;
10 c. The sales factor is a fraction, the numerator of which
11 is the total sales or gross revenue of the taxpayer in
12 this state during the tax period, and the denominator
13 of which is the total sales or gross revenue of the
14 taxpayer everywhere during the tax period. “Sales”,
15 as used in this subsection, does not include sales or
16 gross revenue which are separately allocated in
17 paragraph 4 of this subsection.
18 (1) Sales of tangible personal property have a situs
19 in this state if the property is delivered or
20 shipped to a purchaser other than the United
21 States government, within this state regardless
22 of the FOB Freight on Board (FOB) point or other
23 conditions of the sale; or the property is
24 shipped from an office, store, warehouse, factory
Req. No. 1747 Page 24
1 or other place of storage in this state and (a)
2 the purchaser is the United States government or
3 (b) the taxpayer is not doing business in the
4 state of the destination of the shipment.
5 (2) In the case of a railroad or interurban railway
6 enterprise, the numerator of the fraction shall
7 not be less than the allocation of revenues to
8 this state as shown in its annual report to the
9 Corporation Commission.
10 (3) In the case of an airline, truck or bus
11 enterprise or freight car, tank car, refrigerator
12 car or other railroad equipment enterprise, the
13 numerator of the fraction shall include a portion
14 of revenue from interstate transportation in the
15 proportion that interstate mileage traveled in
16 Oklahoma this state bears to total interstate
17 mileage traveled.
18 (4) In the case of an oil, gasoline or gas pipeline
19 enterprise, the numerator of the fraction shall
20 be either the total of traffic units of the
21 enterprise within Oklahoma this state or the
22 revenue allocated to Oklahoma this state based
23 upon miles moved, at the option of the taxpayer,
24 and the denominator of which shall be the total
Req. No. 1747 Page 25
1 of traffic units of the enterprise or the revenue
2 of the enterprise everywhere as appropriate to
3 the numerator. A “traffic unit” is hereby
4 defined as the transportation for a distance of
5 one (1) mile of one (1) barrel of oil, one (1)
6 gallon of gasoline or one thousand (1,000) cubic
7 feet of natural or casinghead gas, as the case
8 may be.
9 (5) In the case of a telephone or telegraph or other
10 communication enterprise, the numerator of the
11 fraction shall include that portion of the
12 interstate revenue as is allocated pursuant to
13 the accounting procedures prescribed by the
14 Federal Communications Commission; provided that
15 in respect to each corporation or business entity
16 required by the Federal Communications Commission
17 to keep its books and records in accordance with
18 a uniform system of accounts prescribed by such
19 Commission, the intrastate net income shall be
20 determined separately in the manner provided by
21 such uniform system of accounts and only the
22 interstate income shall be subject to allocation
23 pursuant to the provisions of this subsection.
24 Provided further, that the gross revenue factors
Req. No. 1747 Page 26
1 shall be those as are determined pursuant to the
2 accounting procedures prescribed by the Federal
3 Communications Commission.
4 In any case where the apportionment of the three factors
5 prescribed in this paragraph attributes to Oklahoma this state a
6 portion of net income of the enterprise out of all appropriate
7 proportion to the property owned and/or business transacted within
8 this state, because of the fact that one or more of the factors so
9 prescribed are not employed to any appreciable extent in furtherance
10 of the enterprise; or because one or more factors not so prescribed
11 are employed to a considerable extent in furtherance of the
12 enterprise; or because of other reasons, the Tax Commission is
13 empowered to permit, after a showing by taxpayer that an excessive
14 portion of net income has been attributed to Oklahoma this state, or
15 require, when in its judgment an insufficient portion of net income
16 has been attributed to Oklahoma this state, the elimination,
17 substitution, or use of additional factors, or reduction or increase
18 in the weight of such prescribed factors. Provided, however, that
19 any such variance from such prescribed factors which has the effect
20 of increasing the portion of net income attributable to Oklahoma
21 this state must not be inherently arbitrary, and application of the
22 recomputed final apportionment to the net income of the enterprise
23 must attribute to Oklahoma this state only a reasonable portion
24 thereof.

13 for determining the percentage of the investment which each eligible
14 taxpayer may exclude. The exclusion provided by this paragraph

16 the event the total reduction in tax liability authorized by this
17 paragraph exceeds One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) in any
18 calendar year, the Tax Commission shall permit any excess over One
19 Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) and shall factor such excess into

13 (2) if the principal source of premiums written by an

13 the proportion which the sum of the direct
14 premiums written for insurance on property or
15 risks in this state by each ceding company from
16 which reinsurance is accepted bears to the sum of
17 the total direct premiums written by each such
18 ceding company for the taxable year.
19 5. The net income or loss remaining after the separate
20 allocation in paragraph 4 of this subsection, being that which is
21 derived from a unitary business enterprise, shall be apportioned to
22 this state on the basis of the arithmetical average of three factors
23 consisting of property, payroll and sales or gross revenue
24 enumerated as subparagraphs a, b and c of this paragraph. Net
Req. No. 1747 Page 20

1 inco me or loss as used in this paragraph includes that derived from

5 including the sale or other disposition of such property and any
6 other property used in the unitary enterprise. Deductions used in
7 computing such net income or loss shall not include taxes based on
8 or measured by income. Provided, for corporations whose property
9 for purposes of the tax imposed by Section 2355 of this title has an
10 initial investment cost equaling or exceeding Two Hundred Million
11 Dollars ($200,000,000.00) and such investment is made on or after
12 July 1, 1997, or for corporations which expand their property or
13 facilities in this state and such expansion has an investment cost
14 equaling or exceeding Two Hundred Million Dollars ($200,000,000.00)
15 over a period not to exceed three (3) years, and such expansion is
16 commenced on or after January 1, 2000, the three factors shall be
17 apportioned with property and payroll, each comprising twenty-five
18 percent (25%) of the apportionment factor and sales comprising fifty
19 percent (50%) of the apportionment factor. The apportionment
20 factors shall be computed as follows:
21 a. The property factor is a fraction, the numerator of
22 which is the average value of the taxpayer’s real and
23 tangible personal property owned or rented and used in
24 this state during the tax period and the denominator
Req. No. 1747 Page 21

1 of which is the average value of all the taxpayer’s
2 real and tangible personal property everywhere owned
3 or rented and used during the tax period.
4 (1) Property, the income from which is separately
5 allocated in paragraph 4 of this subsection,
6 shall not be included in determining this
7 fraction. The numerator of the fraction shall
8 include a portion of the investment in
9 transportation and other equipment having no
10 fixed situs, such as rolling stock, buses, trucks
11 and trailers, including machinery and equipment
12 carried thereon, airplanes, salespersons’
13 automobiles and other similar equipment, in the
14 proportion that miles traveled in Oklahoma this
15 state by such equipment bears to total miles
16 traveled,
17 (2) Property owned by the taxpayer is valued at its
18 original cost. Property rented by the taxpayer
19 is valued at eight times the net annual rental
20 rate. Net annual rental rate is the annual
21 rental rate paid by the taxpayer, less any annual
22 rental rate received by the taxpayer from
23 subrentals,
24
Req. No. 1747 Page 22

1 (3) The average value of property shall be determined
2 by averaging the values at the beginning and
3 ending of the tax period but the Oklahoma Tax
4 Commission may require the averaging of monthly
5 values during the tax period if reasonably
6 required to reflect properly the average value of
7 the taxpayer’s property;
8 b. The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of
9 which is the total compensation for services rendered
10 in the state during the tax period, and the
11 denominator of which is the total compensation for
12 services rendered everywhere during the tax period.
13 “Compensation”, as used in this subsection, means
14 those paid-for services to the extent related to the
15 unitary business but does not include officers’
16 salaries, wages and other compensation.
17 (1) In the case of a transportation enterprise, the
18 numerator of the fraction shall include a portion
19 of such expenditure in connection with employees
20 operating equipment over a fixed route, such as
21 railroad employees, airline pilots, or bus
22 drivers, in this state only a part of the time,
23 in the proportion that mileage traveled in
24
Req. No. 1747 Page 23

1 Oklahoma this state bears to total mileage
2 traveled by such employees,
3 (2) In any case the numerator of the fraction shall
4 include a portion of such expenditures in
5 connection with itinerant employees, such as
6 traveling salespersons, in this state only a part
7 of the time, in the proportion that time spent in
8 Oklahoma this state bears to total time spent in
9 furtherance of the enterprise by such employees;
10 c. The sales factor is a fraction, the numerator of which
11 is the total sales or gross revenue of the taxpayer in
12 this state during the tax period, and the denominator
13 of which is the total sales or gross revenue of the
14 taxpayer everywhere during the tax period. “Sales”,
15 as used in this subsection, does not include sales or
16 gross revenue which are separately allocated in
17 paragraph 4 of this subsection.
18 (1) Sales of tangible personal property have a situs
19 in this state if the property is delivered or
20 shipped to a purchaser other than the United
21 States government, within this state regardless
22 of the FOB Freight on Board (FOB) point or other
23 conditions of the sale; or the property is
24 shipped from an office, store, warehouse, factory
Req. No. 1747 Page 24

1 or other place of storage in this state and (a)
2 the purchaser is the United States government or
3 (b) the taxpayer is not doing business in the
4 state of the destination of the shipment.
5 (2) In the case of a railroad or interurban railway

5 prescribed in this paragraph attributes to Oklahoma this state a
6 portion of net income of the enterprise out of all appropriate
7 proportion to the property owned and/or business transacted within

9 prescribed are not employed to any appreciable extent in furtherance
10 of the enterprise; or because one or more factors not so prescribed
11 are employed to a considerable extent in furtherance of the
12 enterprise; or because of other reasons, the Tax Commission is

15 require, when in its judgment an insufficient portion of net income
16 has been attributed to Oklahoma this state, the elimination,

18 in the weight of such prescribed factors. Provided, however, that
19 any such variance from such prescribed factors which has the effect
20 of increasing the portion of net income attributable to Oklahoma
21 this state must not be inherently arbitrary, and application of the
22 recomputed final apportionment to the net income of the enterprise
23 must attribute to Oklahoma this state only a reasonable portion
24 thereof.
