4 SECTION 4. AMENDATORY 22 O.S. 2021, Section 258, as
5 amended by Section 2, Chapter 269, O.S.L. 2022 (22 O.S. Supp. 2024,
6 Section 258), is amended to read as follows:
7 Section 258. First: The witnesses must be examined in the
8 presence of the defendant, and may be cross-examined by the
9 defendant. On the request of the district attorney, or the
10 defendant, all the testimony must be reduced to writing in the form
11 of questions and answers and signed by the witnesses, or the same
12 may be taken in shorthand and transcribed without signing, and in
13 both cases filed with the clerk of the district court, by the
14 examining magistrate, and may be used as provided in Section 333 of
15 this title. In no case shall the county be liable for the expense
16 in reducing such testimony to writing, unless ordered by the judge
17 of a court of record.
18 Second: The district attorney may, on approval of the county a
19 judge or of the district judge court, issue subpoenas in felony
20 cases and call witnesses before the district attorney and have them
21 sworn and their testimony reduced to writing and signed by the
22 witnesses at the cost of the county. Such examination must be
23 confined to some felony committed against the statutes of the state
24 and triable in that county, and the evidence so taken shall not be
Req. No. 10675 Page 10
1 rece ivable in any civil proceeding. A refusal to obey such subpoena
2 or to be sworn or to testify may be punished as a contempt on
3 complaint and showing to the county court, or district court, or the
4 judges thereof that proper cause exists therefor.
5 Third: No preliminary information shall be filed without the
6 consent or endorsement of the district attorney, unless the
7 defendant be taken in the commission of a felony, or the offense be
8 of such character that the accused is liable to escape before the
9 district attorney can be consulted. If the defendant is discharged
10 and the information is filed without authority from or endorsement
11 of the district attorney, the costs must be taxed to the prosecuting
12 witness, and the county shall not be liable therefor.
13 Fourth: The convening and session of a grand jury does not
14 dispense with the right of the district attorney to file complaints
15 and informations, conduct preliminary hearings and other routine
16 matters, unless otherwise specifically ordered, by a written order
17 of the court convening the grand jury; made on the court's own
18 motion, or at the request of the grand jury.
19 Fifth: There shall be no preliminary examinations in
20 misdemeanor cases.
21 Sixth: A preliminary magistrate hearing judge shall have the
22 authority to limit the evidence presented at the preliminary hearing
23 to that which is relevant to the issues of: (1) whether the crime
24 was committed, and (2) whether there is probable cause to believe
Req. No. 10675 Page 11
1 the defendant committed the crime. Once a showing of probable cause
2 is made the magistrate shall terminate the preliminary hearing and
3 enter a bindover order; provided, however, that the preliminary
4 hearing shall be terminated only if the state made available for
5 inspection and copying law enforcement reports within the
6 prosecuting attorney's knowledge or possession at the time to the
7 defendant five (5) working days prior to the date of the preliminary
8 hearing. The district attorney shall determine whether or not to
9 make the law enforcement reports available prior to the preliminary
10 hearing. If reports are made available, the district attorney shall
11 be required to provide those law enforcement reports that the
12 district attorney knows to exist at the time of providing the
13 reports, but this does not include any physical evidence which may
14 exist in the case. This provision does not require the district
15 attorney to provide copies for the defendant, but only to make them
16 available for inspection and copying by defense counsel. In the
17 alternative, upon agreement of the state and the defendant, the
18 court may terminate the preliminary hearing once a showing of
19 probable cause is made.
20 Seventh: A preliminary magistrate hearing judge shall accept
21 into evidence as proof of prior convictions a noncertified copy of a
22 Judgment and Sentence when the copy appears to the preliminary
23 magistrate hearing judge to be patently accurate. The district
24 attorney shall make a noncertified copy of the Judgment and Sentence
Req. No. 10675 Page 12
1 avai lable to the defendant no fewer than five (5) days prior to the
2 hearing. If such copy is not made available five (5) days prior to
3 the hearing, the court shall continue the portion of the hearing to
4 which the copy is relevant for such time as the defendant requests,
5 not to exceed five (5) days subsequent to the receipt of the copy.
6 Eighth: The purpose of the preliminary hearing is to establish
7 probable cause that a crime was committed and probable cause that
8 the defendant committed the crime.
9 Ninth: The preliminary hearing must be set within nine (9)
10 months sixty (60) days from the initial appearance of the defendant.
11 If commencement of the preliminary hearing is delayed past the nine-
12 month sixty-day time limit, a show cause hearing shall be scheduled
13 by the court to show reason for the delay. If the court fails to
14 find good cause for the delay, the court shall schedule a
15 preliminary hearing as soon as practicable. If the defendant is in
16 pretrial detention, good cause shall be limited to:
17 1. Illness or other justifiable absence of the court, counsel,
18 the defendant, or necessary court personnel;

20 records that will be available within a reasonable time;

19 judge for the district, establish a pretrial pre-appearance bail

18 amount and executing a promise to pay the remaining amount upon a
19 court ordering the bond forfeited.
20 2. An individualized court order may require that a cash bond
21 be fully secured but only if the order complied with all the
22 requirements of Section 251 of this title for imposing bail
23 conditions.

4 SECTION 4. AMENDATORY 22 O.S. 2021, Section 258, as
5 amended by Section 2, Chapter 269, O.S.L. 2022 (22 O.S. Supp. 2024,
6 Section 258), is amended to read as follows:
7 Section 258. First: The witnesses must be examined in the
8 presence of the defendant, and may be cross-examined by the
9 defendant. On the request of the district attorney, or the
10 defendant, all the testimony must be reduced to writing in the form
11 of questions and answers and signed by the witnesses, or the same
12 may be taken in shorthand and transcribed without signing, and in
13 both cases filed with the clerk of the district court, by the
14 examining magistrate, and may be used as provided in Section 333 of
15 this title. In no case shall the county be liable for the expense
16 in reducing such testimony to writing, unless ordered by the judge
17 of a court of record.
18 Second: The district attorney may, on approval of the county a
19 judge or of the district judge court, issue subpoenas in felony
20 cases and call witnesses before the district attorney and have them
21 sworn and their testimony reduced to writing and signed by the
22 witnesses at the cost of the county. Such examination must be
23 confined to some felony committed against the statutes of the state
24 and triable in that county, and the evidence so taken shall not be
Req. No. 10675 Page 10

1 rece ivable in any civil proceeding. A refusal to obey such subpoena
2 or to be sworn or to testify may be punished as a contempt on
3 complaint and showing to the county court, or district court, or the
4 judges thereof that proper cause exists therefor.
5 Third: No preliminary information shall be filed without the
6 consent or endorsement of the district attorney, unless the
7 defendant be taken in the commission of a felony, or the offense be
8 of such character that the accused is liable to escape before the
9 district attorney can be consulted. If the defendant is discharged
10 and the information is filed without authority from or endorsement
11 of the district attorney, the costs must be taxed to the prosecuting
12 witness, and the county shall not be liable therefor.
13 Fourth: The convening and session of a grand jury does not
14 dispense with the right of the district attorney to file complaints
15 and informations, conduct preliminary hearings and other routine
16 matters, unless otherwise specifically ordered, by a written order
17 of the court convening the grand jury; made on the court's own
18 motion, or at the request of the grand jury.
19 Fifth: There shall be no preliminary examinations in
20 misdemeanor cases.
21 Sixth: A preliminary magistrate hearing judge shall have the
22 authority to limit the evidence presented at the preliminary hearing
23 to that which is relevant to the issues of: (1) whether the crime
24 was committed, and (2) whether there is probable cause to believe
Req. No. 10675 Page 11

1 the defendant committed the crime. Once a showing of probable cause
2 is made the magistrate shall terminate the preliminary hearing and
3 enter a bindover order; provided, however, that the preliminary
4 hearing shall be terminated only if the state made available for
5 inspection and copying law enforcement reports within the
6 prosecuting attorney's knowledge or possession at the time to the
7 defendant five (5) working days prior to the date of the preliminary
8 hearing. The district attorney shall determine whether or not to
9 make the law enforcement reports available prior to the preliminary
10 hearing. If reports are made available, the district attorney shall
11 be required to provide those law enforcement reports that the
12 district attorney knows to exist at the time of providing the
13 reports, but this does not include any physical evidence which may
14 exist in the case. This provision does not require the district
15 attorney to provide copies for the defendant, but only to make them
16 available for inspection and copying by defense counsel. In the
17 alternative, upon agreement of the state and the defendant, the
18 court may terminate the preliminary hearing once a showing of
19 probable cause is made.
20 Seventh: A preliminary magistrate hearing judge shall accept
21 into evidence as proof of prior convictions a noncertified copy of a
22 Judgment and Sentence when the copy appears to the preliminary
23 magistrate hearing judge to be patently accurate. The district
24 attorney shall make a noncertified copy of the Judgment and Sentence
Req. No. 10675 Page 12

1 avai lable to the defendant no fewer than five (5) days prior to the
2 hearing. If such copy is not made available five (5) days prior to
3 the hearing, the court shall continue the portion of the hearing to
4 which the copy is relevant for such time as the defendant requests,
5 not to exceed five (5) days subsequent to the receipt of the copy.
6 Eighth: The purpose of the preliminary hearing is to establish
7 probable cause that a crime was committed and probable cause that
8 the defendant committed the crime.
9 Ninth: The preliminary hearing must be set within nine (9)
10 months sixty (60) days from the initial appearance of the defendant.
11 If commencement of the preliminary hearing is delayed past the nine-
12 month sixty-day time limit, a show cause hearing shall be scheduled
13 by the court to show reason for the delay. If the court fails to
14 find good cause for the delay, the court shall schedule a
15 preliminary hearing as soon as practicable. If the defendant is in
16 pretrial detention, good cause shall be limited to:
17 1. Illness or other justifiable absence of the court, counsel,
18 the defendant, or necessary court personnel;
19 2. Unavailability of necessary scientific reports or subpoenaed
20 records that will be available within a reasonable time;

17 security is required determined as provided in Section 251 of this
18 title. Every judicial district may, upon the order of the presiding
19 judge for the district, establish a pretrial pre-appearance bail
20 schedule for use by the sheriff or other operator of a jail or

18 amount and executing a promise to pay the remaining amount upon a
19 court ordering the bond forfeited.
20 2. An individualized court order may require that a cash bond
21 be fully secured but only if the order complied with all the
22 requirements of Section 251 of this title for imposing bail
23 conditions.
24
Req. No. 10675 Page 15

1 E. Bail amounts prescribed by a bail schedule shall not be
2 considered presumptively reasonable when a judge subsequently
3 determines release conditions of the person.

6 installment schedule, shall be a condition of pretrial release,
7 provided that a finding of ability to pay has been made in
8 accordance with Section 251 of this title. The court clerk shall
9 collect the supervision fees.
10 SECTION 6. NEW LAW A new section of law to be codified
11 in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 1105.2a of Title 22, unless
12 there is created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:
13 A. A bond may not be modified, revoked, or forfeited absent a
