1 form to be used for the application, although any application

3 B. 1. A registered voter applying for an absentee ballot by
4 means of electronic communication shall provide his or her name,
5 birth date, an identification number, and other information as may
6 be prescribed by the Secretary of the State Election Board. The

8 application must match the name, birth date, and identification
9 number in the voter registration record in order to apply for an
10 absentee ballot pursuant to this subsection.
11 2. If the voter does not recall which identification number he
12 or she included in the voter registration record, the voter may
13 provide multiple identification numbers, at least one of which must
14 match the identification number in the voter registration record if
15 such record included an identification number. If the name, birth
16 date, or any identification number provided does not match the voter
17 registration record, the voter shall be informed of the failure to
18 match the voter registration record and shall be provided
19 information and instruction to contact the county election board.
20 3. If the voter registration record on file with the county
21 election board does not contain a birth date or identification
22 number, the voter shall not be eligible to apply for an absentee
23 ballot by means of electronic communication but may apply for an
24 absentee ballot pursuant to subsection C of this section.

13 school, or travel. The Secretary of the State Election Board shall
14 prescribe a form to be used for the statement required by this
15 paragraph. Failure to submit this statement will result in the
16 denial of the application.

17 the provisions of Title 26 of the Oklahoma Statutes, unless
18 otherwise permitted by federal or state law, shall indicate on the
19 application the election date for which the absentee ballots are
20 requested. The application shall only be valid for the elections
21 held on that election date in which the voter is eligible to vote.
