1 SECTION 2. AMENDATORY 70 O.S. 2021, Section 18-200.1, as
2 amended by Section 1, Chapter 280, O.S.L. 2023 (70 O.S. Supp. 2024,
3 Section 18-200.1), is amended to read as follows:
4 Section 18-200.1. A. Beginning with the 2022-2023 school year,
5 and each school year thereafter, each school district shall have its
6 initial allocation of State Aid calculated based on the state
7 dedicated revenues actually collected during the preceding fiscal
8 year, the adjusted assessed valuation of the preceding year, and the
9 weighted average daily membership for the school district of the
10 preceding school year. Each school district shall submit the
11 following data based on the first nine (9) weeks, to be used in the
12 calculation of the average daily membership of the school district:
13 1. Student enrollment by grade level;
14 2. Pupil category counts; and
15 3. Transportation supplement data.
16 On or before December 30, the State Department of Education
17 shall determine each school district's current year allocation
18 pursuant to subsection D of this section. The State Department of
19 Education shall complete an audit, using procedures established by
20 the Department, of the student enrollment by grade level data, pupil
21 category counts, and transportation supplement data to be used in
22 the State Aid Formula pursuant to subsection D of this section by
23 December 1 and by January 15 shall notify each school district of
24 the district's final State Aid allocation for the current school
ENGR. H. B. NO. 1086 Page 8
1 year . The January payment of State Aid and each subsequent payment
2 for the remainder of the school year shall be based on the final
3 State Aid allocation as calculated in subsection D of this section.
4 Except for reductions made due to the assessment of penalties by the
5 State Department of Education according to law, the January payment
6 of State Aid and each subsequent payment for the remainder of the
7 school year shall not decrease by an amount more than the amount
8 that the current chargeable revenue increases for that district.
9 B. The State Department of Education shall retain not less than
10 one and one-half percent (1 1/2%) of the total funds appropriated
11 for financial support of schools, to be used to make midyear
12 adjustments in State Aid and which shall be reflected in the final
13 allocations. If the amount of appropriated funds, including the one
14 and one-half percent (1 1/2%) retained, remaining after January 1 of
15 each year is not sufficient to fully fund the final allocations, the
16 Department shall recalculate each school district's remaining
17 allocation pursuant to subsection D of this section using the
18 reduced amount of appropriated funds.
19 C. On and after July 1, 1997, the amount of State Aid each
20 district shall receive shall be the sum of the Foundation Aid, the
21 Salary Incentive Aid, and the Transportation Supplement, as adjusted
22 pursuant to the provisions of subsection G of this section and
23 Section 18-112.2 of this title; provided, no district having per
24 pupil revenue in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the
ENGR. H. B. NO. 1086 Page 9
1 aver age per pupil revenue of all districts shall receive any State
2 Aid or Supplement in State Aid.
3 The July calculation of per pupil revenue shall be determined by
4 dividing the district's second preceding year's total weighted
5 average daily membership (ADM) into the district's second preceding
6 year's total revenues excluding federal revenue, insurance loss
7 payments, reimbursements, recovery of overpayments and refunds,
8 unused reserves, prior expenditures recovered, prior year surpluses,
9 and less the amount of any transfer fees paid in that year.
10 The December calculation of per pupil revenue shall be
11 determined by dividing the district's preceding year's total
12 weighted average daily membership (ADM) into the district's
13 preceding year's total revenues excluding federal revenue, insurance
14 loss payments, reimbursements, recovery of overpayments and refunds,
15 unused reserves, prior expenditures recovered, prior year surpluses,
16 and less the amount of any transfer fees paid in that year.
17 D. For the 1997-98 school year, and each school year
18 thereafter, Foundation Aid, the Transportation Supplement, and
19 Salary Incentive Aid shall be calculated as follows:
20 1. Foundation Aid shall be determined by subtracting the amount
21 of the Foundation Program Income from the cost of the Foundation
22 Program and adding to this difference the Transportation Supplement.
23 a. The Foundation Program shall be a district's higher
24 weighted average daily membership based on the first
ENGR. H. B. NO. 1086 Page 10
1 nine (9) weeks of the current school year or the

3 determined by the provisions of subsection A of
4 Section 18-201.1 of this title and paragraphs 1, 2, 3,
5 and 4 of subsection B of Section 18-201.1 of this
6 title, multiplied by the Base Foundation Support
7 Level. However, for the portion of weighted
8 membership derived from nonresident, transferred
9 pupils enrolled in online courses, the Foundation
10 Program shall be a district's weighted average daily
11 membership of the preceding school year or the first
12 nine (9) weeks of the current school year, whichever
13 is greater, as determined by the provisions of
14 subsection A of Section 18-201.1 of this title and
15 paragraphs 1, 2, 3, and 4 of subsection B of Section
16 18-201.1 of this title, multiplied by the Base
17 Foundation Support Level.
18 b. The Foundation Program Income shall be the sum of the
19 following:
20 (1) The the adjusted assessed valuation of the
21 current school year of the school district, minus
22 the previous year protested ad valorem tax

ENGR. H. B. NO. 1086 Page 11
1 the mills levied pursuant to subsection (c) of
2 Section 9 of Article X of the Oklahoma
3 Constitution, if applicable, as adjusted in
4 subsection (c) of Section 8A of Article X of the
5 Oklahoma Constitution. For purposes of this
6 subsection, the "adjusted assessed valuation of
7 the current school year" shall be the adjusted
8 assessed valuation on which tax revenues are
9 collected during the current school year, and
10 (2) Seventy-five seventy-five percent (75%) of the
11 amount received by the school district from the
12 proceeds of the county levy during the preceding
13 fiscal year, as levied pursuant to subsection (b)
14 of Section 9 of Article X of the Oklahoma
15 Constitution, and
16 (3) motor vehicle collections, and
17 (4) gross production tax, and
18 (5) state apportionment, and
19 (6) R.E.A. tax.
20 The items listed in divisions (3), (4), (5), and (6) of
21 this subparagraph shall consist of the amounts actually
22 collected from such sources during the preceding fiscal
23 year calculated on a per capita basis on the unit provided
24 for by law for the distribution of each such revenue.
ENGR. H. B. NO. 1086 Page 12

2 daily haul times the per capita allowance times the appropriate
3 transportation factor.
4 a. The average daily haul shall be the number of children
5 in a district who are legally transported and who live
6 one and one-half (1 1/2) miles or more from school.

2 valuation of the property upon which taxes were determined
3 uncollectible.
4 2. In the event that the amount of funds a school district
5 receives for reimbursement from the Ad Valorem Reimbursement Fund is
6 less than the amount of funds claimed for reimbursement by the
7 school district due to insufficiency of funds as provided in Section
8 193 of Title 62 of the Oklahoma Statutes, then the school district's

3 Section 18-200.1), is amended to read as follows:
4 Section 18-200.1. A. Beginning with the 2022-2023 school year,
5 and each school year thereafter, each school district shall have its
6 initial allocation of State Aid calculated based on the state
7 dedicated revenues actually collected during the preceding fiscal
8 year, the adjusted assessed valuation of the preceding year, and the
9 weighted average daily membership for the school district of the
10 preceding school year. Each school district shall submit the
11 following data based on the first nine (9) weeks, to be used in the
12 calculation of the average daily membership of the school district:
13 1. Student enrollment by grade level;
14 2. Pupil category counts; and
15 3. Transportation supplement data.
16 On or before December 30, the State Department of Education
17 shall determine each school district's current year allocation
18 pursuant to subsection D of this section. The State Department of
19 Education shall complete an audit, using procedures established by

24 the district's final State Aid allocation for the current school
ENGR. H. B. NO. 1086 Page 8

5 State Department of Education according to law, the January payment
6 of State Aid and each subsequent payment for the remainder of the
7 school year shall not decrease by an amount more than the amount
8 that the current chargeable revenue increases for that district.
9 B. The State Department of Education shall retain not less than
10 one and one-half percent (1 1/2%) of the total funds appropriated
11 for financial support of schools, to be used to make midyear
12 adjustments in State Aid and which shall be reflected in the final
13 allocations. If the amount of appropriated funds, including the one
14 and one-half percent (1 1/2%) retained, remaining after January 1 of
15 each year is not sufficient to fully fund the final allocations, the
16 Department shall recalculate each school district's remaining
17 allocation pursuant to subsection D of this section using the
18 reduced amount of appropriated funds.
19 C. On and after July 1, 1997, the amount of State Aid each
20 district shall receive shall be the sum of the Foundation Aid, the

ENGR. H. B. NO. 1086 Page 9

1 aver age per pupil revenue of all districts shall receive any State
2 Aid or Supplement in State Aid.
3 The July calculation of per pupil revenue shall be determined by
4 dividing the district's second preceding year's total weighted
5 average daily membership (ADM) into the district's second preceding
6 year's total revenues excluding federal revenue, insurance loss
7 payments, reimbursements, recovery of overpayments and refunds,
8 unused reserves, prior expenditures recovered, prior year surpluses,
9 and less the amount of any transfer fees paid in that year.
10 The December calculation of per pupil revenue shall be
11 determined by dividing the district's preceding year's total
12 weighted average daily membership (ADM) into the district's
13 preceding year's total revenues excluding federal revenue, insurance
14 loss payments, reimbursements, recovery of overpayments and refunds,
15 unused reserves, prior expenditures recovered, prior year surpluses,
16 and less the amount of any transfer fees paid in that year.
17 D. For the 1997-98 school year, and each school year
18 thereafter, Foundation Aid, the Transportation Supplement, and
19 Salary Incentive Aid shall be calculated as follows:
20 1. Foundation Aid shall be determined by subtracting the amount
21 of the Foundation Program Income from the cost of the Foundation
22 Program and adding to this difference the Transportation Supplement.
23 a. The Foundation Program shall be a district's higher
24 weighted average daily membership based on the first

5 and 4 of subsection B of Section 18-201.1 of this
6 title, multiplied by the Base Foundation Support
7 Level. However, for the portion of weighted
8 membership derived from nonresident, transferred
9 pupils enrolled in online courses, the Foundation
10 Program shall be a district's weighted average daily
11 membership of the preceding school year or the first
12 nine (9) weeks of the current school year, whichever
13 is greater, as determined by the provisions of
14 subsection A of Section 18-201.1 of this title and
15 paragraphs 1, 2, 3, and 4 of subsection B of Section
16 18-201.1 of this title, multiplied by the Base
17 Foundation Support Level.
