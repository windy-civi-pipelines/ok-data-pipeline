8 Section 18-200.1. A. Beginning with the 2022-2023 school year,
9 and each school year thereafter, each school district shall have its
10 initial allocation of State Aid calculated based on the state
11 dedicated revenues actually collected during the preceding fiscal
12 year, the adjusted assessed valuation of the preceding year, and the
13 weighted average daily membership for the school district of the
14 preceding school year. Each school district shall submit the
15 following data based on the first nine (9) weeks, to be used in the
16 calculation of the average daily membership of the school district:
17 1. Student enrollment by grade level;
18 2. Pupil category counts; and
19 3. Transportation supplement data.
20 On or before December 30, the State Department of Education

18 and one-half percent (1 1/2%) retained, remaining after January 1 of
19 each year is not sufficient to fully fund the final allocations, the
20 Department shall recalculate each school district's remaining
21 allocation pursuant to subsection D of this section using the
22 reduced amount of appropriated funds.
23 C. On and after July 1, 1997, the amount of State Aid each

8 dividing the district's second preceding year's total weighted
9 average daily membership (ADM) into the district's second preceding
10 year's total revenues excluding federal revenue, insurance loss
11 payments, reimbursements, recovery of overpayments and refunds,
12 unused reserves, prior expenditures recovered, prior year surpluses,
13 and less the amount of any transfer fees paid in that year.
14 The December calculation of per pupil revenue shall be
15 determined by dividing the district's preceding year's total

12 Level. However, for the portion of weighted
13 membership derived from nonresident, transferred
14 pupils enrolled in online courses, the Foundation
15 Program shall be a district's weighted average daily
16 membership of the preceding school year or the first
17 nine (9) weeks of the current school year, whichever
18 is greater, as determined by the provisions of
19 subsection A of Section 18-201.1 of this title and

8 Section 18-200.1. A. Beginning with the 2022-2023 school year,
9 and each school year thereafter, each school district shall have its
10 initial allocation of State Aid calculated based on the state

16 calculation of the average daily membership of the school district:

19 3. Transportation supplement data.
20 On or before December 30, the State Department of Education

14 one and one-half percent (1 1/2%) of the total funds appropriated
15 for financial support of schools, to be used to make midyear

11 payments, reimbursements, recovery of overpayments and refunds,
12 unused reserves, prior expenditures recovered, prior year surpluses,
13 and less the amount of any transfer fees paid in that year.

12 Level. However, for the portion of weighted
13 membership derived from nonresident, transferred
14 pupils enrolled in online courses, the Foundation
15 Program shall be a district's weighted average daily
16 membership of the preceding school year or the first
17 nine (9) weeks of the current school year, whichever
18 is greater, as determined by the provisions of
19 subsection A of Section 18-201.1 of this title and
