criminal offense has been committed against the minor child by
7
8
someone other than a parent, unless the incident has first been
8
9
reported to law enforcement and notification of the parent would
9

impede a law enforcement or Department of Human Services

18
violation of the laws of this state. This section shall not be
18
19
construed to apply to a parental action or decision that would end
19
20
life. This section does not prohibit courts, law enforcement
20
21
officers, or employees of a government agency responsible for child
21
22
welfare from acting in their official capacity within the reasonable
22
23
and prudent scope of their authority. This section does not

8
9
D. Unless those rights have been legally waived or legally
9
10
terminated, parents have inalienable rights that are more
10
11
comprehensive than those listed in this section. The Parents’ Bill
11
12
of Rights does not prescribe all rights of parents. Unless
12
13
otherwise required by law, the rights of parents of minor children
13
14
shall not be limited or denied. The Parents’ Bill of Rights shall
14
15
not be construed to apply to a parental action or decision that
15
16
would end life.
