RESOLUTION NO. 1016 By: Munson
A Resolution recognizing April as Sexual Assault
Awareness Month and April 30, 2025, as Denim Day;
supporting Peace Over Violence and the YWCA.
WHEREAS, April is nationally recognized as Sexual Assault
Awareness Month and the Peace Over Violence organization has
declared April 30, 2025, as Denim Day. Both events draw attention
to the misconceptions and misinformation about sexual violence,
which remains a serious issue in our society; and
WHEREAS, sexual harassment is part of a continuum of violence
whose damaging effects are felt throughout our culture. Harmful
attitudes about all forms of sexual violence allow these issues to
persist and allow victims and survivors to be revictimized; and
WHEREAS, every 68 seconds an American is sexually assaulted and
approximately one in four women is raped during their lifetime; and
WHEREAS, in Oklahoma, the rate of rape and attempted rape among
females reported to law enforcement has been 35-45% higher than the
U.S. rate for the past decade; and
WHEREAS, Oklahoma law enforcement reported 2,245 forcible and
attempted rapes in 2020 - which represented 12.5% of all violent
crimes, and reported rape cases have increased 21% over the past 3
years, and 34.2% overall since 2013; and
WHEREAS, youth under 18 account for about 44% of all reported
sexual assaults, at least 25% of women experience sexual harassment
in the workplace and about 75% of sexual harassment victims
experience retaliation when they report it; and

WHEREAS, sexual violence and its unfair and traumatizing effects
are preventable with proper education on the matter and
comprehensive prevention projects; and
WHEREAS, members of the Oklahoma House of Representatives
strongly support the efforts of Peace Over Violence and the YWCA of
Oklahoma City to educate persons in our state about the true impact
of sexual harassment, abuse, assault and rape.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
OF THE 1ST SESSION OF THE 60TH OKLAHOMA LEGISLATURE:
THAT the Oklahoma House of Representatives recognizes the month
of April as Sexual Assault Awareness Month.
THAT the Oklahoma House of Representatives designates April 30,
2025, as Denim Day and urges everyone to wear jeans on this day to
help communicate the message that there is no excuse and there is
never an invitation to harass, abuse, assault or rape.
Adopted by the House of Representatives the 30th day of April,
2025.
