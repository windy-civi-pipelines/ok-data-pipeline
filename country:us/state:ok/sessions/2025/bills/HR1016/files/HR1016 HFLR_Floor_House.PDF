13 WHEREAS, April is nationally recognized as Sexual Assault
14 Awareness Month and the Peace Over Violence organization has
15 declared April 30, 2025, as Denim Day. Both events draw attention
16 to the misconceptions and misinformation about sexual violence,
17 which remains a serious issue in our society; and
18 WHEREAS, sexual harassment is part of a continuum of violence
19 whose damaging effects are felt throughout our culture. Harmful

21 persist and allow victims and survivors to be revictimized; and
22 WHEREAS, every 68 seconds an American is sexually assaulted and
23 approximately one in four women is raped during their lifetime; and
