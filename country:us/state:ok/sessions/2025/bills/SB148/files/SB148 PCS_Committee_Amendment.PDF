1 Mars hal shall reduce the permit fee by the amount of cost savings

15 to use one or more private providers to provide plan review or

18 that the State Fire Marshal may not review the plans submitted or
19 perform the required building code inspection services to determine
20 compliance with the applicable codes, except to the extent specified
21 by law. Instead, plan review or building code inspection services

23 in the application. State law requires minimum insurance
24 requirements for such personnel, but I understand that I may require
Req. No. 1604 Page 14

5 indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the State Fire Marshal and his
6 or her building code enforcement personnel from any and all claims

19 updated notice. The State Fire Marshal shall not charge a fee for
20 the submission of an updated notice.
21 G. After construction has commenced on a building or structure,
22 and the State Fire Marshal is unable to provide building code
23 inspection services in a timely manner, the fee owner or fee owner’s
24 contractor may elect to use a private provider to provide building
Req. No. 1604 Page 15
