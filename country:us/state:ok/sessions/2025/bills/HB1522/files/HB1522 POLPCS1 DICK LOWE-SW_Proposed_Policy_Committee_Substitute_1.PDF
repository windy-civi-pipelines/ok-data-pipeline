24 to pursue shall be granted at any time in the year unless the number
Req. No. 12395 Page 1

1 of t ransfers exceeds the capacity of a grade level for each school
2 site within a school district. If the capacity of a grade level for
3 each school site within a school district is insufficient to enroll
4 all eligible students, the school district shall select transfer
5 students in the order in which the district received the student
6 transfer applications. The capacity of a school district shall be
7 determined by the school district board of education based on its
8 policy adopted pursuant to subsection B of this section. A student
9 may be granted a one-year transfer and may shall automatically
10 continue to attend the school each school year to which the student
11 transferred with the approval of the receiving district unless the
12 school district denies the continued transfer for the reasons
13 outlined in paragraphs 1 and 2 of subsection B of this section. At
14 the end of each school year, a school district may only deny
15 continued transfer of the student for the reasons outlined in
16 paragraphs 1 and 2 of subsection B of this section. Any brother or
17 sister of a student who transfers may attend the school district to
18 which the student transferred, if the school district policy gives
19 preference to sibling transfers regardless of capacity, and the
20 brother or sister of the transferred student does not meet a basis
21 for denial as outlined in paragraphs 1 and 2 of subsection B of this
22 section. Any child in the custody of the Department of Human
23 Services in foster care who is living in the home of a student who
24 transfers may attend the school district to which the student

3 more than two (2) times per school year to one or more school
4 districts in which the student does not reside, provided that the
5 student may always reenroll at any time in his or her school
6 district of residence. At the discretion of the receiving district,
7 a student who has attended a school district as a resident student
8 for at least three (3) years prior to becoming eligible to apply as
9 a transfer student may be allowed to transfer to the school district
10 regardless of capacity.

13 automatically approved.
14 B. Each school district board of education shall adopt a policy
15 to determine the number of transfer students the school district has
16 the capacity to accept in each grade level for each school site
17 within a school district no later than January 1, 2022. The policy
18 may include:
19 1. The acts and reasons outlined in Section 24-101.3 of this

18 transfer students for each grade level for each school site within a
