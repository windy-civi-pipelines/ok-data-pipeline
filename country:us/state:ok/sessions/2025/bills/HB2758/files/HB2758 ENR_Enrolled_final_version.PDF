SECTION 1. NEW LAW A new section of law to be codified
in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 508 of Title 69, unless there is
created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:
A. There is hereby created in the State Treasury a revolving
fund to be designated as the "Preserving and Advancing County
Transportation Fund" (PACT Fund). The fund shall be a continuing
fund, not subject to fiscal year limitations, and shall consist of
all monies directed for deposit to the fund by law including, but
not limited to, apportionments made pursuant to paragraph 10 of
subsection B of Section 1004 of Title 68 of the Oklahoma Statutes.
All monies accruing to the credit of said fund are hereby

appropriated and may be allocated, budgeted, and expended pursuant
to subsection B of this section. Expenditures from said fund shall
be made upon warrants issued by the State Treasurer against claims
filed as prescribed by law with the Director of the Office of
Management and Enterprise Services for approval and payment.
B. 1. Two-thirds (2/3) of the monies deposited to the credit
of the PACT Fund shall be allocated as follows:
a. to the various counties in a manner that increases a
county's per county mile highway construction and
maintenance ratio to a target ratio of Four Thousand
Dollars ($4,000.00) per county road mile, prioritizing
counties with the lowest such ratio, until all of the
various counties reach such target ratio, and
b. any remaining amounts as follows:
(1) fifty percent (50%) shall be allocated to the
various counties in the proportion which the
certified county road miles of each county bears
to the sum of county road miles in the state, and
(2) fifty percent (50%) shall be allocated to the
various counties in the proportion which the
number of county bridges in each county according
to the most recent ODOT Bridge Summary Report for
County Bridges bears to the total sum of county
bridges in the state according to such report.
Each county treasurer shall deposit such funds to the county's
county highway fund and such funds shall be used for constructing
and maintaining the county highway system.
2. One-third (1/3) of the monies deposited to the credit of the
PACT Fund shall be used as necessary for the reconstruction of
county bridges on the portion of the county highway system defined
as major collector routes in accordance with the provisions of
Section 654 of Title 69 of the Oklahoma Statutes. Prior to any
funds for such projects being allocated, the counties shall submit
the proposed projects to the Department of Transportation, which
shall evaluate and confirm whether the proposed projects are in
accordance with the criteria provided for in this subsection.
Bridges proposed for reconstruction will be generally evaluated
based on the state of project innovation, readiness, structural
ENR. H. B. NO. 2758 Page 2

adequacy, safety, serviceability, functional obsolescence,
essentiality for public use, structural deficiency ranking as
captured in the most recent ODOT Bridge Summary Report at the time
of submission, and special reductions for characteristics such as
detour length, traffic safety features, and current school bus
routes. Upon confirmation by the Department of Transportation that
a proposed project is in accordance with the criteria provided for
in this subsection, funds shall be allocated to the county for use
in such project.
