20 A. There is hereby created in the State Treasury a revolving
21 fund to be designated as the “Preserving and Advancing County
22 Transportation Fund” (PACT Fund). The fund shall be a continuing
23 fund, not subject to fiscal year limitations, and shall consist of

Req. No. 2074 Page 1

2 subsection B of Section 1004 of Title 68 of the Oklahoma Statutes.
3 All monies accruing to the credit of the fund are hereby

7 claims filed as prescribed by law with the Director of the Office of
8 Management and Enterprise Services for approval and payment.
9 B. Fifty percent (50%) of the monies deposited to the credit of
10 the PACT Fund shall be allocated to the various counties in a manner
11 that increases a county’s per county mile highway construction and
12 maintenance ratio to a target ratio of Four Thousand Dollars
13 ($4,000.00) per county road mile, prioritizing counties with the
14 lowest such ratio, until all of the various counties reach such
15 target ratio. Any remaining amounts shall be allocated to the
16 various counties in the proportion which the certified county road
17 miles of each county bears to the sum of county road miles in the
18 state.
19 C. 1. Fifty percent (50%) of the monies deposited to the
20 credit of the PACT Fund shall be allocated to the various counties
21 as necessary for the reconstruction of county bridges on the portion
22 of the county highway system defined as major collector routes in

2 Department of Transportation, which shall evaluate and confirm
3 whether the proposed projects are in accordance with the criteria
4 provided for in this subsection prior to any funds for such projects
5 being allocated.
6 2. Bridges proposed for reconstruction will be generally
7 evaluated based on the state of project innovation, readiness,
8 structural adequacy, safety, serviceability, functional
9 obsolescence, essentiality for public use, structural deficiency
10 ranking as captured in the most recent ODOT bridge summary report at
11 the time of submission, and special reductions for characteristics
12 such as detour length, traffic safety features, and current school
13 bus routes.
14 D. Each county treasurer shall deposit such funds as received
15 under the provisions of this section to the county’s county highway
16 fund, and such funds shall be used for constructing and maintaining
17 the county highway system.
