15
amended to read as follows:
15
16
Section 3009.1. A. Upon the trial of any civil action arising
16
17
from personal injury, the actual amounts paid for any services in
17
18
the treatment of the injured party, including doctor bills, hospital
18
19
bills, ambulance service bills, drug and other prescription bills,
19
20
and similar bills shall be the amounts admissible at trial, not the
20
21
amounts billed for such expenses incurred in the treatment of the
21
22
party. If, in addition to evidence of payment, a party submits a
22
23
signed statement acknowledged by the medical provider or an
23
24
authorized representative or sworn testimony that the provider will

accept the amount paid as full payment of the obligations, the
1
2
statement or testimony shall be admitted into evidence. The
2
3
statement or testimony shall be part of the record as an exhibit but
3
4
need not be shown to the jury. If a medical provider has filed a
4
5
lien in the case for an amount in excess of the amount paid, then
5
6
the bills in excess of the amount paid, but not more than the amount
6
7
of the lien, shall be admissible.
7
8
B. If no payment has been made, the Medicare reimbursement
8
9
rates in effect when the personal injury occurred, not the amounts
9
10
billed, shall be admissible if, in addition to evidence of
10
11
nonpayment, a party submits a signed statement acknowledged by the
11
12
medical provider or an authorized representative or sworn testimony
12
13
that the provider will accept payment at the Medicare reimbursement
13
14
rate less cost of recovery as provided in Medicare regulations as
14
15
full payment of the obligation. The statement or testimony shall be
15
16
admitted into evidence and shall be part of the record as an exhibit
16
17
but need not be shown to the jury. If a medical provider has filed
17
18
a lien in the case for an amount in excess of the Medicare rate,
18
19
then the bills in excess of the amount of the Medicare rate, but not
19
20
more than the amount of the lien, shall be admissible.
20
21
C. If no bills have been paid, or no statement acknowledged by
21
22
the medical provider or sworn testimony as provided in subsections A
22
23
and B of this section is provided to the opposing party and listed
23

8
9
to any health insurance covering the plaintiff or any public or
9
10
government-sponsored health care benefit program for which the
10
11
injured party is eligible, regardless of whether the incurred but
11
12
not yet satisfied charges have been or will be submitted to the
12
13
injured partyâ€™s health insurance or public or government-sponsored
13
14
health care benefit program.

12
13
injured party is eligible cannot be determined for any aspect of
13
14
necessary future treatment of the injured party not yet incurred,
14
15
then the Medicare reimbursement rates in effect at the time of trial

reasonable value of any necessary future treatment of the injured
23
24
party not yet incurred.
