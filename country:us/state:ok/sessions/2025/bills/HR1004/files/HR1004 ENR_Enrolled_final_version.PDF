WHEREAS, one of the great hallmarks of our American form of
government is the right of our citizens to express their opinions on
matters of great import to their elected officials; and
WHEREAS, all members of the Oklahoma House of Representatives
greatly esteem and respect this right of the citizens to give their
considered input and insight to elected members of the Oklahoma
House of Representatives, who are solemnly charged with crafting
legislation for the people as a whole; and
WHEREAS, the right to life of the unborn is one of the great
public policy issues of our day, both for the American people and
for Oklahomans of whatever political philosophy or persuasion; and
WHEREAS, members of the Oklahoma House of Representatives affirm
that all human life is sacred from the point of conception; and

WHEREAS, members of the Oklahoma House of Representatives have
led the nation in adopting legislation to defend unborn children;
and
WHEREAS, members of the Oklahoma House of Representatives oppose
any policy that would require citizens to pay for abortions through
their taxpayer dollars or medical insurance premiums; and
WHEREAS, Oklahoma will continue to lead the nation in the
introduction and enactment of legislation to protect unborn
children; and
WHEREAS, on Rose Day 2025, hundreds of our fellow Oklahomans
will take time out of their busy lives to come to their State
Capitol to make a public statement respecting the sanctity of human
life and the worth of every unborn individual and to speak with
their elected officials; and
WHEREAS, members of the Oklahoma House of Representatives
greatly appreciate the heartfelt involvement of these committed
Oklahoma citizens, both young and old, male and female.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
OF THE 1ST SESSION OF THE 60TH OKLAHOMA LEGISLATURE:

until legal protection for the lives of unborn children has been
restored.
