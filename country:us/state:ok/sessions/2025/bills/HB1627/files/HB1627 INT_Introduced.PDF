10 address of the person so selected. The two arbitrators so selected
11 and named shall, within five (5) days from and after the expiration
12 of the ten-day period hereinabove mentioned, agree upon and select a
13 third arbitrator. If, on the expiration of the period allowed
14 therefor, the arbitrators are unable to agree upon the selection of
