BE IT ENACTED BY THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF OKLAHOMA:
14
15
SECTION 1. AMENDATORY 17 O.S. 2021, Section 286, is
15
16
amended to read as follows:
16
17
Section 286. A. 1. The portion of costs incurred by an
17
18
electric utility, which is subject to rate regulation by the
18
19
Corporation Commission, for transmission upgrades approved by a
19
20
regional transmission organization to which the utility is a member
20
21
and resulting from an order of a federal regulatory authority having
21
22
legal jurisdiction over interstate regulation of transmission rates,
22
23
shall be presumed recoverable by the utility. The presumption
23
24
established in this paragraph may be rebutted by evidence that the
24
Req. No. 341 Page 1

1
costs so incurred by the utility for the transmission upgrades
1
2
exceed the scope of the project authorized by the regional
2
3
transmission organization or order issued by the federal regulatory
3
4
authority having jurisdiction over interstate regulation of
4
5
transmission rates. The Commission shall transmit rules to
5
6
implement the requirements of this subsection to the Legislature on
6
7
or before April 1, 2006. The rules may authorize an electric
7
8
utility to periodically adjust its rates to recover all or a portion
8
9
of the costs so incurred by the utility for the transmission
9
10
upgrades.
10
11
2. Reasonable costs incurred by an electric utility for
11
12
transmission upgrades:
12
13
a. needed to develop wind generation in this state,
13
14
b. approved by the Southwest Power Pool, and
14
15
c. placed into service before December 31, 2013,
15
16
shall be presumed recoverable through a periodic adjustment in the
16
17
rates of the utility, provided that the presumption of the recovery
17
18
of such costs or the recovery of such costs through a periodic
18
19
adjustment in rates may be rebutted by evidence presented to the
19
20
Commission. The determination of whether the costs shall be
20
21
recovered and whether the costs shall be recovered through a
21
22
periodic adjustment of rates shall be made by the Commission
22
23
following proper notice and hearing in a cause to be filed by the
23
24
24
Req. No. 341 Page 2

1
electric utility in which it files such information as the
1
2
Commission may require.
2
3
B. An electric utility subject to rate regulation by the
3
4
Corporation Commission may file an application seeking Commission
4
5
authorization of a plan by the utility to make capital expenditures
5
6
for equipment or facilities necessary to comply with the federal
6
7
Clean Air Act (CAA), the Clean Water Act (CWA), the Comprehensive
7
8
Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA),
8
9
the Emergency Planning & Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA), the
9
10
Endangered Species Act (ESA), the National Environmental Policy Act
10
11
(NEPA), the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA), the Oil
11
12
Pollution Act (OPA), the Pollution Prevention Act (PPA), the
12
13
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), the Safe Drinking
13
14
Water Act (SDWA), the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), all as
14
15
amended, and, as the Commission may deem appropriate, federal,
15
16
state, local or tribal environmental requirements which apply to
16
17
generation facilities. If approved by the Commission, after notice
17
18
and hearing, the equipment or facilities specified in the approved
18
19
utility plan are conclusively presumed used and useful. The utility
19
20
may elect to periodically adjust its rates to recover the costs of
20
21
the expenditures. The utility shall file a request for a review of
21
22
its rates pursuant to Section 152 of this title no more than twenty-
22
23
four (24) months after the utility begins recovering the costs
23
24
through a periodic rate adjustment mechanism and no more than
24
Req. No. 341 Page 3

1
twenty-four (24) months after the utility begins recovering the
1
2
costs through any subsequent periodic rate adjustment mechanism.
2
3
Provided further, that a periodic rate adjustment or adjustments are
3
4
not intended to prevent a utility from seeking cost recovery of
4
5
capital expenditures as otherwise may be authorized by the
5
6
Commission. However, the reasonableness of the costs to be
6
7
recovered by the utility shall be subject to Commission review and
7
8
approval. The Commission shall promulgate rules to implement the
8
9
provisions of this subsection, such rules to be transmitted to the
9
10
Legislature on or before April 1, 2007.
10
11
C. 1. An electric utility subject to rate regulation by the
11
12
Corporation Commission may elect to file an application seeking
12
13
approval by the Commission to construct a new electric generating
13
14
facility, to purchase an existing electric generation facility or
14
15
enter into a long-term contract for purchased power and capacity
15
16
and/or energy, subject to the provisions of this subsection. If,
16
17
and to the extent that, the Commission determines there is a need
17
18
for construction or purchase of the electric generating facility or
18
19
long-term purchase power contract, the generating facility or
19
20
contract shall be considered used and useful and its costs shall be
20
21
subject to cost recovery rules promulgated by the Commission. The
21
22
Commission shall enter an order on an application filed pursuant to
22
23
this subsection within two hundred forty (240) days of the filing of
23
24
the application, following notice and hearing and after
24
Req. No. 341 Page 4

1
consideration of reasonable alternatives, unless the electric
1
2
generation facility utilizes natural gas as its primary fuel source.
2
3
If the electric generation facility uses natural gas as its primary
3
4
fuel source, then the Commission shall enter an order on an
4
5
application filed pursuant to this subsection within one hundred
5
6
eighty (180) days of the filing of the application, following notice
6
7
and hearing and after consideration of reasonable alternatives.
7
8
2. Regardless of the generation source, bids received by the
8
9
utility through a competitive bidding process within the twelve (12)
9
10
months following the final bid due date of such competitive bidding
10
11
process shall be considered substantial evidence to satisfy the
11
12
consideration of reasonable alternatives.
12
13
3. Following receipt of an application filed pursuant to this
13
14
subsection, the Corporation Commission staff may file a request to
14
15
assess the specific costs, to be paid by the electric utility and
15
16
which shall be deemed to be recoverable, for the costs associated
16
17
with conducting the analysis or investigation of the application
17
18
including, but not limited to, the cost of acquiring expert
18
19
witnesses, consultants, and analytical services. The request shall
19
20
be filed at and heard by the Corporation Commissioners in the docket
20
21
opened by the electric utility pursuant to this subsection. After
21
22
notice and hearing, the Commission shall decide the request.
22
23
3. 4. Additionally, following receipt of an application filed
23
24
pursuant to this subsection, the Office of the Attorney General may
24
Req. No. 341 Page 5

1
file a request with the Corporation Commission for the assessment of
1
2
specific costs, to be paid by the electric utility and which shall
2
3
be deemed to be recoverable, associated with the performance of the
3
4
Attorney General’s duties as provided by law. Those costs may
4
5
include, but are not limited to, the cost of acquiring expert
5
6
witnesses, consultants and analytical services. The request shall
6
7
be filed at and heard by the Corporation Commissioners in the docket
7
8
opened by the electric utility pursuant to this subsection. After
8
9
notice and hearing, the Commission shall decide the request.
9
10
4. 5. The Commission shall promulgate rules to implement the
10
11
provisions of this subsection. The rules shall be transmitted to
11
12
the Legislature on or before April 1, 2006. In promulgating rules
12
13
to implement the provisions of this subsection, the Commission shall
13
14
consider, among other things, rules which would:
14
15
a. permit contemporaneous utility recovery from its
15
16
customers, the amount necessary to cover the
16
17
Corporation Commission staff and Attorney General
17
18
assessments as authorized by this subsection,
18
19
b. establish how the cost of facilities approved pursuant
19
20
to this subsection shall be timely reviewed, approved,
20
21
and recovered or disapproved, and
21
22
c. establish the information which an electric utility
22
23
must provide when filing an application pursuant to
23
24
this subsection.
24
Req. No. 341 Page 6

5. 6. The Commission shall also consider rules which may permit
1
2
an electric utility to begin to recover return on or and return of
2
3
Construction-Work-In-Progress expenses prior to commercial operation
3
4
of a newly constructed electric generation facility subject to the
4
5
provisions of this subsection, provided the newly constructed
5
6
electric generation facility utilizes natural gas as its primary
6
7
fuel source. The Commission shall permit a separate rate adjustment
7
8
mechanism, adjusted periodically, to recover the costs described in
8
9
this paragraph. If a public utility implements a rate adjustment
9
10
mechanism pursuant to this paragraph and subsequently terminates the
10
11
initiative to construct or acquire stake in the electric generation
11
12
facility, the Commission shall have the authority, following notice
12
13
and hearing, to order the public utility to refund customers any
13
14
amounts collected through such rate adjustment mechanism. In
14
15
ordering any such refund, the Commission shall give consideration as
15
16
to the circumstances resulting in the termination of the
16
17
construction or acquisition.
17
18
SECTION 2. NEW LAW A new section of law to be codified
18
19
in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 286A of Title 17, unless there
19
20
is created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:
20
21
A. 1. On and after the effective date of this act, a public
21
22
utility shall defer to a regulatory asset ninety percent (90%) of
22
23
all depreciation expenses and return associated with all qualifying
23
24
electric plants placed in service, provided the public utility has
24
Req. No. 341 Page 7

1
provided notice to the Corporation Commission of the public
1
2
utility’s election to make such deferrals pursuant to this section.
2
3
Deferral under this section shall begin on the effective date of
3
4
this act if the public utility notifies the Commission of the
4
5
election prior to the effective date, or on the date that the
5
6
utility notifies the Commission of the election if such date is
6
7
after the effective date of this act.
7
8
2. For the purposes of this section, “qualifying electric
8
9
plant” means all incremental electric plants placed in service by a
9
10
public utility following the utility’s last general rate case,
10
11
excluding transmission facilities or new electric generating units.
11
12
B. The Commission shall conduct a prudence review of the
12
13
associated qualifying electric plant resulting in the regulatory
13
14
asset balances prior to moving such balances into the public
14
15
utility’s rate base. The regulatory asset balances arising under
15
16
this section shall be adjusted to reflect any prudence disallowances
16
17
of the associated qualifying electric plant, following notice and
17
18
hearing, as ordered by the Commission.
18
19
C. Unless otherwise provided by this section, in each general
19
20
rate proceeding concluded on or after July 1, 2025, the balance of
20
21
the regulatory asset as of the end of the test year shall be
21
22
included in the public utility’s rate base without any offset,
22
23
reduction, or adjustment based upon consideration of any other
23
24
factor with the regulatory asset balances arising from deferrals
24
Req. No. 341 Page 8

1
associated with the qualifying electric plant placed in service
1
2
after the end of the test year.
2
3
D. Parts of regulatory asset balances created under this
3
4
section that are not included in rate base shall accrue carrying
4
5
costs at the public utility’s weighted average cost of capital plus
5
6
applicable federal, state, and local income or excise taxes.
6
7
Regulatory asset balances arising under this section that are
7
8
included in rate base shall be recovered in rates through a twenty-
8
9
year amortization beginning on the date new rates reflecting such
9
10
amortization take effect.
10
11
E. Depreciation expenses deferred under this section shall
11
12
account for any qualifying electric plant placed into service.
12
13
Return deferred under this section shall be determined using the
13
14
weighted average cost of capital approved by the Commission in the
14
15
public utility’s last general rate case and applied to the change in
15
16
regulatory asset balances caused by the qualifying electric plant,
16
17
plus applicable federal, state, and local income or excise taxes.
17
18
In determining the return deferred, the public utility shall account
18
19
for changes in all plant-related accumulated deferred income taxes
19
20
and changes in accumulated depreciation, excluding retirements.
20
21
F. This section shall only apply to any public utility that has
21
22
elected to make the deferrals for which this section provides and
22
23
filed a notice with the Commission of such election.
23
24
SECTION 3. This act shall become effective July 1, 2025.

1
2
of the public peace, health or safety, an emergency is hereby
2
3
declared to exist, by reason whereof this act shall take effect and
3
4
be in full force from and after its passage and approval.
