subcontractors in order of tier ranking as determined by the federal
contract verifier may assume the role of the prime and apply to
become a qualified federal contractor provided the entity meets the

b. benefits a geographic area where new direct jobs which
meet the requirements of the Oklahoma Quality Jobs
Program Act are created by an establishment, other
than the proxy establishment, which is a branch of the

A proxy establishment may be determined to be an establishment
for all purposes of the Oklahoma Quality Jobs Program Act by the
Department and incentive payments may be made to such proxy
establishment for new direct jobs otherwise qualified pursuant to
the Oklahoma Quality Jobs Program Act. The Department may
promulgate rules to further specify the circumstances under which a
proxy establishment may be considered an establishment for the
purposes of making application for incentive payments pursuant to
the Oklahoma Quality Jobs Program Act. Provided however, that with
respect to any data on qualifying direct new jobs from a branch of
the Armed Forces of the United States, such rules shall only require
a proxy establishment to provide such data as would otherwise be
publicly releasable by the branch of the Armed Forces of the United
States.
B. The Incentive Approval Committee is hereby created and shall
consist of the Director of the Office of Management and Enterprise
Services, the Director of the Department and one member of the

for the Oklahoma Quality Jobs Program Act, subject to the applicable
requirements.
C. For an establishment defined as a “basic industry” pursuant
to division (4) of subparagraph a of paragraph 1 of subsection A of
this section, the Incentive Approval Committee shall consist of the

ENR. S. B. NO. 586 Page 10

state of employees who are employed by an employment
agency or similar entity other than the establishment

approval by the Department of the application of the
establishment or the job otherwise qualifies as a new
direct job following a change-in-control event. The
leasing of employees by the establishment or employees
provided under contract with an establishment shall
constitute an employer-employee relationship between
those employees and the establishment. A job shall be
deemed to exist in this state prior to approval of an
application if the activities and functions for which
the particular job exists have been ongoing at any
time within six (6) months prior to such approval.
