21
22
class, and no court may certify a class under Section 2023 of Title
22
23
12 of the Oklahoma Statutes, in any civil action brought under this
23

24
Req. No. 1530 Page 8

shall apply extraterritorially to the maximum extent permitted by

the United States Constitution and the Oklahoma Constitution.

in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 3246.4 of Title 12, unless there

is created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:

described by subsection A of this section, then the action may not
18
19
be transferred to a different venue without the written consent of
19
20

20
21
SECTION 5. NEW LAW A new section of law to be codified
21
22
in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 3246.5 of Title 12, unless there
22

23
24
24
Req. No. 1530 Page 9

1
A. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the state shall
1
2
have sovereign immunity, each of its political subdivisions shall
2
3
have governmental immunity, and each officer and employee of this
3
4
state or a political subdivision shall have official immunity, and
4
5
sovereign or governmental immunity, as appropriate, in any action,
5
6
claim, counterclaim, or any type of legal or equitable action that
6
7
challenges the validity of any provision or application of this act,
7
8
on constitutional grounds or otherwise, or that seeks to prevent or
8
9
enjoin the state, its political subdivisions, or any officer or
9
10
employee of this state or a political subdivision from enforcing any
10
11
provision or application of this act, or from hearing, adjudicating,
11
12
or docketing a civil action brought under Section 3 of this act,
12
13
unless that immunity has been abrogated or preempted by federal law
13
14
in a manner consistent with the United States Constitution. The
14
15
sovereign immunity conferred by this section upon the state and each
15
16
of its officers and employees includes the constitutional sovereign
16
17
immunity recognized by the Supreme Court of the United States in
17
18
Seminole Tribe of Florida v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44 (1996), and Alden
18
19
v. Maine, 527 U.S. 706 (1999), which applies in both state and
19
20
federal court and which may not be abrogated by Congress or by any
20
21
state or federal court except pursuant to congressional legislation
21
22
authorized by Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United
22
23
States Constitution, by the Bankruptcy Clause of Article I, or by
23
24
Congress’s powers to raise and support armies and to provide and
24
Req. No. 1530 Page 10

1
maintain a navy, or by any other ground that might be recognized by
1
2
the Supreme Court of the United States.
2
3
B. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,
3
4
the immunities conferred by subsection A of this section shall apply
4
5
in every court, both state and federal, and in every adjudicative
5
6
proceeding of any type whatsoever.
6
7
C. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no provision of
7
8
state law may be construed to waive or abrogate an immunity
8
9
described in subsection A of this section unless it expressly waives
9
10
or abrogates immunity with specific reference to this section.
10
11
D. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no attorney
11
12
representing the state, its political subdivisions, or any officer
12
13
or employee of this state or a political subdivision is authorized
13
14
or permitted to waive an immunity described in subsection A of this
14
15
section or take any action that would result in a waiver of that
15
16
immunity, and any such action or purported waiver shall be regarded
16
17
as a legal nullity and an ultra vires act.
17
18
E. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no court of this
18
19
state may award declaratory or injunctive relief, or any type of
19
20
stay or writ, including a writ of prohibition, that would pronounce
20
21
any provision or application of this act invalid or
21
22
unconstitutional, or that would restrain the state, its political
22
23
subdivisions, any officer, employee, or agent of this state or a
23
24
political subdivision, or any person from enforcing any provision or
24
Req. No. 1530 Page 11

1
application of this act, or from hearing, adjudicating, docketing,
1
2
or filing a civil action brought under Section 3 of this act, and no
2
3
court of this state shall have jurisdiction to consider any action,
3
4
claim, or counterclaim that seeks such relief, and no such action,
4
5
claim, or counterclaim may be litigated on behalf of a plaintiff or
5
6
defendant class, notwithstanding Section 2023 of Title 12 of the
6
7
Oklahoma Statutes, and no court may certify a plaintiff or defendant
7
8
class in any action seeking the relief described in this subsection.
8
9
F. Nothing in this section or act shall be construed to prevent
9
10
a litigant from asserting the invalidity or unconstitutionality of
10
11
any provision or application of this act as a defense to any action,
11
12
claim, or counterclaim brought against that litigant.
12
13
SECTION 6. NEW LAW A new section of law to be codified
13
14
in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 3246.6 of Title 12, unless there
14
15
is created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:
15
16
A. Mindful of Leavitt v. Jane L., 518 U.S. 137 (1996), in which
16
17
in the context of determining the severability of a state statute
17
18
regulating abortion the Supreme Court of the United States held that
18
19
an explicit statement of legislative intent is controlling, it is
19
20
the intent of the Legislature that every provision, section,
20
21
subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or word in this act, and every
21
22
application of the provisions in this act to every person, group of
22
23
persons, or circumstances, are severable from each other.
23
24
24
Req. No. 1530 Page 12

1
B. If any application of any provision in this act to any
1
2
person, group of persons, or circumstances is found by a court to be
2
3
invalid, preempted, or unconstitutional, for any reason whatsoever,
3
4
then the remaining applications of that provision to all other
4
5
persons and circumstances shall be severed and preserved, and shall
5
6
remain in effect. All constitutionally valid applications of the
6
7
provisions in this act shall be severed from any applications that a
7
8
court finds to be invalid, preempted, or unconstitutional, because
8
9
it is the Legislature’s intent and priority that every single valid
9
10
application of every statutory provision be allowed to stand alone.
10
11
C. The Legislature further declares that it would have enacted
11
12
this act, and each provision, section, subsection, sentence, clause,
12
13
phrase, or word, and all constitutional applications of the
13
14
provisions of this act, irrespective of the fact that any provision,
14
15
section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or word, or
15
16
applications of this act were to be declared invalid, preempted, or
16
17
unconstitutional.
17
18
D. If any provision of this act is found by any court to be
18
19
unconstitutionally vague, then the applications of that provision
19
20
that do not present constitutional vagueness problems shall be
20
21
severed and remain in force, consistent with the severability
21
22
requirements of subsections A, B, and C of this section.
22
23
E. No court may decline to enforce the severability
23
24
requirements of subsections A, B, C, and D of this section on the
24
Req. No. 1530 Page 13

1
ground that severance would “rewrite” the statute or involve the
1
2
court in legislative or lawmaking activity. A court that declines
2
3
to enforce or enjoins a state official from enforcing a statutory
3
4
provision does not rewrite a statute, as the statute continues to
4
5
contain the same words as before the court’s decision. A judicial
5
6
injunction or declaration of unconstitutionality:
6
7
1. Is nothing more than an edict prohibiting enforcement that
7
8
may subsequently be vacated by a later court if that court has a
8
9
different understanding of the requirements of the Oklahoma
9
10
Constitution or United States Constitution;
10
11
2. Is not a formal amendment of the language in a statute; and
11
12
3. No more rewrites a statute than a decision by the executive
12
13
not to enforce a duly enacted statute in a limited and defined set
13
14
of circumstances.
14
15
F. If any state or federal court disregards the severability
15
16
requirements of subsections A, B, C, D, and E of this section, and
16
17
declares or finds any provision of this act facially invalid,
17
18
preempted, or unconstitutional, when there are discrete applications
18
19
of that provision that can be enforced against a person, group of
19
20
persons, or circumstances without violating federal law or the
20
21
federal or state constitutions, then that provision shall be
21
22
interpreted, as a matter of state law, as if the Legislature had
22
23
enacted a provision limited to the persons, group of persons, or
23
24
circumstances for which the provision’s application will not violate
24
Req. No. 1530 Page 14

1
federal law or the federal or state constitutions, and every court
1
2
and every state official shall adopt this saving construction of
2
3
that provision until the court ruling that pronounced the provision
3
4
facially invalid, preempted, or unconstitutional is vacated or
4
5
overruled.
5
6
SECTION 7. It being immediately necessary for the preservation
6
7
of the public peace, health or safety, an emergency is hereby
7
8
declared to exist, by reason whereof this act shall take effect and
8
9
be in full force from and after its passage and approval.
