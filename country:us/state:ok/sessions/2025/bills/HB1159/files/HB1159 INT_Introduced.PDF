Req. No. 10262 Page 1

1 of t ransfers exceeds the capacity of a grade level for each school
2 site within a school district. If the capacity of a grade level for
3 each school site within a school district is insufficient to enroll
4 all eligible students, the school district shall select transfer
5 students in the order in which the district received the student
6 transfer applications. The capacity of a school district shall be
7 determined by the school district board of education based on its
8 policy adopted pursuant to subsection B of this section. A student
9 may be granted a one-year transfer and may automatically continue to
10 attend the school each school year to which the student transferred
11 with the approval of the receiving district. At the end of each
12 school year, a school district may deny continued transfer of the
13 student for the reasons outlined in paragraphs 1 and 2 of subsection
14 B of this section. Any brother or sister of a student who transfers
15 may attend the school district to which the student transferred, if
16 the school district policy gives preference to sibling transfers
17 regardless of capacity, and the brother or sister of the transferred
18 student does not meet a basis for denial as outlined in paragraphs 1
19 and 2 of subsection B of this section. Any child in the custody of
20 the Department of Human Services in foster care who is living in the
21 home of a student who transfers may attend the school district to
22 which the student transferred. Except for a child in the custody of
23 the Department of Human Services in foster care, a transfer student
24 shall not transfer more than two (2) times per school year to one or
Req. No. 10262 Page 2

1 more school districts in which the student does not reside, provided
2 that the student may always reenroll at any time in his or her
3 school district of residence. At the discretion of the receiving
4 district, a student who has attended a school district as a resident
5 student for at least three (3) years prior to becoming eligible to
6 apply as a transfer student may be allowed to transfer to the school
7 district regardless of capacity.
8 If the grade a student is entitled to pursue is not offered in
9 the district where the student resides, the transfer shall be
10 automatically approved.
11 B. Each school district board of education shall adopt a policy
12 to determine the number of transfer students the school district has
13 the capacity to accept in each grade level for each school site
14 within a school district no later than January 1, 2022. The policy
15 may include:
16 1. The acts and reasons outlined in Section 24-101.3 of this
17 title as a basis for denial of a transfer; and
18 2. A history of absences as a basis for denial of a transfer.

20 more absences in one semester that are not excused for the reasons

17 E. If a transfer request is denied by the school district based
18 on capacities set and approved by the receiving school district's
19 board of education, the denial shall not be subject to appeal. If
20 the transfer request is denied based on attendance or discipline,
21 the parent of the student may appeal the denial within ten (10) days
22 of notification of the denial to the receiving school district board
23 of education. The receiving school district board of education
