23 code violation in a reasonable time.

Req. No. 10263 Page 2

1 B. A landlord may not, within sixty (60) days after the date of
2 the tenant's action under subsection A of this section, retaliate
3 against the tenant by:
4 1. Filing an eviction proceeding, except for legitimate reasons
5 authorized by law;
6 2. Depriving the tenant of the use of the premises, except for
7 reasons authorized by law;
8 3. Increasing the tenant's rent or terminating the tenant's
9 lease; or
10 4. Engaging, in bad faith, in a course of conduct that
11 materially interferes with the tenant's rights under the tenant's
12 lease.
13 C. The landlord is not liable for retaliation under this
14 section if the action was not made for purposes of retaliation, nor
15 is the landlord liable, unless the action violates a prior court
16 order for:
17 1. Increasing rent under an escalation clause in a written
18 lease; or
19 2. Increasing rent or reducing services as part of a pattern of
20 rent increases or service reductions.
21 D. An eviction or lease termination based on the following
22 circumstances, which are valid grounds for eviction or lease
23 termination in any event, does not constitute retaliation:
24
Req. No. 10263 Page 3

1 1. The tenant is delinquent in rent when the landlord gives
2 notice to vacate or files an eviction action;
3 2. The tenant, a member of the tenant's family, the tenant's
4 animal or pet, or another person's animal or pet on the premises
5 with the tenant's consent intentionally damages property on the
6 premises or by word or conduct threatens the personal safety of the
7 landlord, the landlord's employees, agents, or another tenant;
8 3. The tenant has breached the lease, other than by holding
9 over, except as provided by this section;
10 4. The tenant holds over after giving notice of termination or
11 intent to vacate;
12 5. The tenant holds over after the landlord gives notice of
13 termination effective at the end of the rental term;
14 6. The tenant holds over and the landlord's notice of
15 termination is motivated by a good-faith belief that the tenant or a
16 member of the tenant's family, the tenant's animal or pet, or
17 another person's animal or pet on the premises with the tenant's
18 consent might:
19 a. adversely affect the quiet enjoyment by other tenants
20 or neighbors,
21 b. materially affect the health or safety of the
22 landlord, other tenants, or neighbors, or
23 c. damage the property of the landlord, other tenants, or
24 neighbors; or
Req. No. 10263 Page 4

1 7. Any other reason authorized by the Oklahoma Residential
2 Landlord and Tenant Act or the lease agreement.
3 SECTION 3. NEW LAW A new section of law to be codified
4 in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 139 of Title 41, unless there is
5 created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:
6 In addition to other remedies provided by law, if a landlord
7 retaliates against a tenant under this act, the tenant may recover
8 from the landlord a civil penalty of one (1) month's rent, actual
9 damages, court costs, and actual and reasonable attorney fees, less
10 any delinquent rents or other sums for which the tenant is liable to
11 the landlord. If the tenant's rent payment to the landlord is
12 subsidized in whole or in part by a governmental entity, the civil
13 penalty granted under this section shall reflect the fair market
14 rent of the dwelling.
15 SECTION 4. NEW LAW A new section of law to be codified
16 in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 140 of Title 41, unless there is
17 created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:
18 A. If a tenant files or prosecutes a suit for retaliatory
19 action based on a complaint asserted under Section 2 of this act and
20 the government building or housing inspector or utility company
21 representative visits the premises and determines that a violation
22 of a building or housing code did not exist or that a utility
23 problem did not exist, there is a rebuttable presumption that the
24 tenant acted in bad faith.
Req. No. 10263 Page 5

1 B. In addition to other remedies provided by law, if a tenant
2 files or prosecutes a suit under this act in bad faith, or makes a
3 retaliation defense claim in any Forcible Entry and Detainer action
4 in bad faith, the landlord shall be granted immediate possession of
5 the dwelling unit and may recover from the tenant court costs, and
6 actual and reasonable attorney fees. If a tenant files or
7 prosecutes a suit under this act in bad faith a second or any
8 subsequent time, the landlord may recover possession of the dwelling
9 unit and may recover from the tenant a civil penalty of one (1)
10 month's rent plus Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00), court costs, and
11 actual and reasonable attorney fees.
12 SECTION 5. This act shall become effective November 1, 2025.
