the rule impact statement from the agency is incomplete or contains

under this act.

nonmajor rule if the agency is required to implement a statute or
federal requirement that does not require an agency to interpret or

deemed necessary by the Legislature. The resolution shall contain
no other provisions.

amended to read as follows:
ENR. H. B. NO. 2728 Page 2

Section 8012. A. The Legislative Office of Fiscal Transparency
(LOFT) shall:
1. Gather information regarding the proposed budgets of
executive branch agencies each fiscal year;
2. Analyze the information and evaluate the extent to which the
agency budget does or does not fulfill the agency’s primary duties
and responsibilities under applicable provisions of federal, state,
or other law;
3. Analyze and forecast all revenues available to the agency
from appropriations, fees, dedicated revenue, or any other source;
4. Compare the agency budget information to the comparable
information contained in that agency’s budget requests from prior
fiscal years; and
5. Conduct such investigations regarding the operations of the
agency as required in order to fulfill the duties imposed upon the
Office by law or as otherwise directed by the oversight committee;
and
6. Conduct rule impact analyses for major rules, as defined in
Section 250.3 of Title 75 of the Oklahoma Statutes.
The oversight committee, subject to the direction of the
President Pro Tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of
Representatives, shall ensure that the functions performed by the
Office pursuant to the provisions of this subsection do not
duplicate those of the Senate Committee on Appropriations Committee
of the Senate and the House Committee on Appropriations and Budget
Committee of the House of Representatives and their respective
staffs.
B. The Office shall further conduct performance evaluations and
may conduct independent comprehensive performance audits. The
oversight committee created in Section 3 8013 of this act title may
periodically identify specific executive branch agencies, or
programs, activities, or functions within executive branch agencies,
for which the Office shall conduct a performance evaluation or
independent comprehensive performance audit.
C. As used in Section 8011 et seq. of this act title,
“performance evaluation” means an examination of a program,
ENR. H. B. NO. 2728 Page 3

accordance with applicable government auditing standards or auditing
and evaluation standards of other appropriate authoritative bodies.
The term includes, but is not limited to, an examination of issues

to the agency or program; and

directed by the oversight committee.
D. As used in Section 8011 et seq. of this act title,
“independent comprehensive performance audit (ICPA)” audit” (ICPA)
includes, but is not limited to, a review and analysis of the
economy, efficiency, effectiveness, and compliance of the policies,
management, fiscal affairs, and operations of state agencies,
divisions, programs, and accounts. The results of an ICPA may be
used by the Legislature to implement the best budgeting and policy-
making practices for government services to run in the most cost-
effective way. The Office may, at the direction of the oversight
committee and subject to the approval of the President Pro Tempore
of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives,
contract with a private company, nonprofit organization, or academic
institution to assist with an independent comprehensive performance
audit or for professional consulting and administrative support
ENR. H. B. NO. 2728 Page 4

services. The Office may, but shall not be required to, contract

request for proposals issued, for professional services necessary to
complete each ICPA. Prior to entering into any contract, the Office

auditing services, unless the Office LOFT determines that fewer than
three entities meet the qualifications to bid to perform such
services as set forth by the Office LOFT. The cost of the contract
shall be paid by the Legislative Services Service Bureau.

the rule impact statement from the agency is incomplete or contains
substantive inaccuracies.

may request that LOFT analyze the rule pursuant to the provisions of
this section.
E. State agencies shall cooperate fully with LOFT and the
Legislature in providing data, documentation, and analysis required
under this act.
F. LOFT shall make all analyses and determinations publicly

3. 4. To the extent an agency for good cause finds the
preparation of a rule impact statement or the specified contents
thereof are unnecessary or contrary to the public interest in the
process of adopting a particular nonmajor rule, the agency may
request the Governor to waive such requirement. Such request shall
be in writing and shall state the agency’s findings and the
justification for such findings. Upon request by an agency, the
Governor may also waive the rule impact statement requirements for a
ENR. H. B. NO. 2728 Page 24

nonmajor rule if the agency is required to implement a statute or
federal requirement that does not require an agency to interpret or
describe the requirements, such as federally mandated provisions
which afford the agency no discretion to consider less restrictive
alternatives. If the Governor fails to waive such requirement, in
writing, prior to publication of the notice of the intended
rulemaking action, the rule impact statement shall be completed.
The determination to waive the rule impact statement shall not be
subject to judicial review.
4. The rule shall not be invalidated on the ground that the
contents of the rule impact statement are insufficient or
inaccurate.
E. Upon completing the requirements of this section, an agency
may adopt a proposed rule. No rule is valid unless adopted in
substantial compliance with the provisions of this section.
SECTION 8. AMENDATORY 75 O.S. 2021, Section 308, as
amended by Section 5, Chapter 38, O.S.L. 2023 (75 O.S. Supp. 2024,

legislative session of that year to review such rules. Provided,
proposed permanent rules for consideration by the 2nd Session of the
59th Legislature shall be submitted on or before March 1. For each
legislative session thereafter, proposed permanent rules shall be
submitted on or before February 1 of the given year; and

C. Unless otherwise authorized by the Legislature, whenever a
rule is disapproved as provided in subsection B of this section, the
agency adopting such rules shall not have authority to resubmit an
identical rule, except during the first sixty (60) calendar days of
the next regular legislative session. Any effective emergency rule
which would have been superseded by a disapproved permanent rule
shall be deemed null and void on the date the Legislature
disapproves the permanent rule. Rules may be disapproved in part or
in whole by the Legislature. Upon enactment of any joint resolution
disapproving a rule, the agency shall file notice of such
legislative disapproval with the Secretary of State for publication
in “The Oklahoma Register”.
D. Unless otherwise provided by specific vote of the
Legislature, joint resolutions introduced for purposes of
disapproving or approving a rule or the omnibus joint resolution

provisions as may be necessary for disapproval or approval of a
rule, and any such other direction or mandate regarding the rule
deemed necessary by the Legislature. The resolution shall contain
no other provisions.
E. A proposed permanent rule shall be deemed finally adopted
if:
1. Approved by the Legislature pursuant to Section 308.3 of
this title, provided that any such joint resolution becomes law in
accordance with Section 11 of Article VI of the Oklahoma
Constitution;
2. Approved by a joint resolution pursuant to subsection B of
this section, provided that any such resolution becomes law in
accordance with Section 11 of Article VI of the Oklahoma
Constitution; or
3. Disapproved by a joint resolution pursuant to subsection B
of this section or Section 308.3 of this title which has been vetoed
by the Governor in accordance with Section 11 of Article VI of the
Oklahoma Constitution and the veto has not been overridden.
Provided, major rules shall be addressed in one or more joint
resolutions only addressing major rules, regardless of if the joint
resolution is to approve or disapprove such rules.
ENR. H. B. NO. 2728 Page 26

F. Prior to final adoption of a rule, an agency may withdraw a
rule from legislative review. Notice of such withdrawal shall be
given to the Governor, the Speaker of the House of Representatives,
the President Pro Tempore of the Senate, and to the Secretary of
State for publication in “The Oklahoma Register”.
G. An agency may promulgate an emergency rule only pursuant to
Section 253 of this title.

SECTION 10. It being immediately necessary for the preservation
of the public peace, health or safety, an emergency is hereby
declared to exist, by reason whereof this act shall take effect and
