1
persona of any employer, principal, officer, director, employee, or
1
2
stockholder other than that existing in the role of employer of the
2
3
employee shall be relevant for consideration for purposes of this
3
4
act the Administrative Workers’ Compensation Act, and the remedies
4
5
and rights provided by this act the Administrative Workers’
5
6
Compensation Act to an employee or other person claiming rights to
6
7
recovery on behalf of the employee shall be exclusive regardless of
7
8
the multiple roles, capacities, or personas the employer may be
8
9
deemed to have.
9
10
B. Notwithstanding the date of the injury, illness, or death of
10
11
an employee, nothing in subsection A of this section shall affect
11
12
any provision in an executed contract that requires the employer, or
12
13
any principal, officer, director, stockholder, partner, or prime
13
14
contractor of the employer, to indemnify, defend, or hold harmless
14
15
another person or entity against liability for an injury, illness,
15
16
or death of an employee, including, but not limited to, the ability

21
Compensation Act. An injured employee, or his or her legal

5
6
intent of the employer to cause such injury. Allegations or proof

7
that the employer had knowledge that the injury was substantially

8
certain to result from the employer’s conduct shall not constitute
8
9
an intentional tort. The employee shall plead facts that show it is
9
10
at least as likely as it is not that the employer acted with the
10
11
purpose of injuring the employee. The issue of whether an act is an
11
12
intentional tort shall be a question of law.
12
13
C. D. The immunity from civil liability described in subsection
13
14
A of this section shall apply regardless of whether the injured
14
15
employee is denied compensation or deemed ineligible to receive
15
16
compensation under this act the Administrative Workers’ Compensation
16
17
Act.
17
18
D. E. If an employer has failed to secure the payment of
18
19
compensation for his or her injured employee as provided for in this
19
20
act the Administrative Workers’ Compensation Act, an injured
20
21
employee, or his or her legal representative if death results from
21
22
the injury, may maintain an action in the district court for damages
22
23
on account of such injury.
