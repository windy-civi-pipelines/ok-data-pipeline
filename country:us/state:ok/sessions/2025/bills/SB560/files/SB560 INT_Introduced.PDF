B. The question at the special election shall be whether a
1
2
majority of such affected landowners are in favor of or against the
2
3
proposed turnpike route. Such special election is to be organized
3
4
and conducted by the county election board in each county where the
4
5
property of each affected landowner is located. Notice of such
5
6
election shall be given by publication in a newspaper of general
6

9
10
public places in such county or counties for at least twenty (20)
10

11
12
years elapse from the time that a vote takes place prior to a
12
13
project’s or a route’s legislative authorization, the prior vote
13
14
shall be presumptively considered to have lapsed and a new special
14
15
election in line with the above criteria must be held prior to any
15
16
legislative authorization for the construction of any such turnpike
16
17
or turnpike extension.

19
instances where fee simple title of an affected parcel of land is
19
20
held in co-tenancy or in joint tenancy, any one of the owners may
20
21
vote, but, in order for such vote to be given effect, it shall be
21
22
necessary for the representative or representatives of such
22
23
landowner to present to the county election board proxies or other
23
24
reliable form of proof as shall be developed by the State Election
