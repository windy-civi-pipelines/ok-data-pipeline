18
D. 1. The Department of Corrections shall develop a matrix of
18
19
technical violations and sanctions to address violations committed
19
20
by persons who are being supervised by the Department. The
20
21
Department shall be authorized to use a violation response and
21
22
intermediate sanction process based on the sanction matrix to apply
22
23
to any technical violations of probationers. Within four (4)
23
24
working days of the discovery of the violation, the probation
24
Req. No. 1320 Page 33
1
officer shall initiate the violation response and intermediate
1
2
sanction process. The sentencing judge may authorize any
2
3
recommended sanctions, which may include, but are not limited to:
3
4
short-term jail or lockup, day treatment, program attendance,
4
5
community service, outpatient or inpatient treatment, monetary
5
6
fines, curfews, ignition interlock devices on vehicles, or a one-
6
7
time referral to a term of confinement of six (6) months in an
7
8
intermediate revocation facility operated by the Department of
8
9
Corrections; provided, upon approval of the district attorney, a
9
10
person may be sanctioned to serve additional terms of confinement in
10
11
an intermediate revocation facility. The probation officer shall
11
12
complete a sanction form, which shall specify the technical
12
13
violation, sanction, and the action plan to correct the noncompliant
13
14
behavior resulting in the technical violation. The probation
14
15
officer shall refer to the sanctioning matrix to determine the
15
16
supervision, treatment, and sanctions appropriate to address the
16
17
noncompliant behavior. The probation officer shall refer the
17
18
violation information and recommended response with a sanction plan
18
19
to the Department of Corrections to be heard by a hearing officer.
19
20
The Department of Corrections shall develop a sanction matrix,
20
21
forms, policies and procedures necessary to implement this
21
22
provision. The Department of Corrections shall establish procedures
22
23
to hear responses to technical violations and review sanction plans
23
24
including the following:
24
Req. No. 1320 Page 34
1
a. hearing officers shall report through a chain of
1
2
command separate from that of the supervising
2
3
probation officers,
3
4
b. the Department shall provide the offender written
4
5
notice of the violation, the evidence relied upon, and
5
6
the reason the sanction was imposed,
6
7
c. the hearing shall be held unless the offender waives
7
8
the right to the hearing,
8
9
d. hearings shall be electronically recorded, and
9
10
e. the Department shall provide to judges and district
10
11
attorneys a record of all violations and actions taken
11
12
pursuant to this subsection.
12
13

Section 45:
2. The hearing officer shall determine based on a preponderance
13
14
of the evidence whether a technical violation occurred. Upon a
14
15
finding that a technical violation occurred, the hearing officer may
15
16
order the offender to participate in the recommended sanction plan
16
17
or may modify the plan. Offenders who accept the sanction plan
17
18
shall sign a violation response sanction form, and the hearing
18
19
officer shall then impose the sanction. Failure of the offender to
19
20
comply with the imposed sanction plan shall constitute a violation
20
21
of the rules and conditions of supervision that may result in a
21
22
revocation proceeding. If an offender does not voluntarily accept
22
23
the recommended sanction plan, the Department shall either impose
23
24
the sanction and allow the offender to appeal to the district court,
24
Req. No. 1320 Page 35
1
or request a revocation proceeding as provided by law. Every
1
2
administrative hearing and sanction imposed by the Department shall
2
3
be appealable to the district court.
3
4

Section 46:
3. Absent a finding of willful nonpayment by the offender, the
4
5
failure of an offender to pay fines and costs may not serve as a
5
6
basis for revocation, excluding restitution.
6
7
E. 1. Where one of the grounds for revocation is the failure
7
8
of the defendant to make restitution as ordered, the Department of
8
9
Corrections shall forward to the district attorney all information
9
10
pertaining to the failure of the defendant to make timely
10
11
restitution as ordered by the court, and the district attorney shall
11
12
file a petition setting forth the grounds for revocation.
12
13

Section 47:
2. The defendant ordered to make restitution can petition the
13
14
court at any time for remission or a change in the terms of the
14
15
order of restitution if the defendant undergoes a change of
15
16
condition which materially affects the ability of the defendant to
16
17
comply with the order of the court.
17
18

Section 48:
3. At the hearing, if one of the grounds for the petition for
18
19
revocation is the failure of the defendant to make timely
19
20
restitution as ordered by the court, the court will hear evidence
20
21
and if it appears to the satisfaction of the court from such
21
22
evidence that the terms of the order of restitution create a
22
23
manifest hardship on the defendant or the immediate family of the
23
24
defendant, the court may cancel all or any part of the amount still
24
Req. No. 1320 Page 36
1
due, or modify the terms or method of payment; provided, however,
1
2
the court shall continue to prioritize an order for payments of
2
3
restitution to the victim to the extent feasible. Provided, if the
3
4
court determines that a reduction in the restitution still due is
4
5
warranted, the court shall equally apply the same percentage
5
6
reduction to any court-ordered monetary obligation owed by the
6
7
defendant including, but not limited to, fines, court costs and
7
8
costs of incarceration.
8
9
F. The court may revoke a portion of the sentence and leave the
9
10
remaining part not revoked, but suspended for the remainder of the
10
11
term of the sentence, and under the provisions applying to it. The
11
12
person whose suspended sentence is being considered for revocation
12
13
at the hearing shall have the right to be represented by counsel, to
13
14
present competent evidence in his or her own behalf and to be
14
15
confronted by the witnesses against the defendant. Any order of the
15
16
court revoking the suspended sentence, in whole or in part, shall be
16
17
subject to review on appeal, as in other appeals of criminal cases.
17
18
Provided, however, that if the crime for which the suspended
18
19
sentence is given was a felony, the defendant may be allowed bail
19
20
pending appeal. If the reason for revocation be that the defendant
20
21
committed a felony, the defendant shall not be allowed bail pending
21
22
appeal.
22
23
G. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections A and B of
23
24
this section, when the suspended sentence of a person is being
24
Req. No. 1320 Page 37
1
considered for revocation for an offense where the penalty has
1
2
subsequently been lowered to a misdemeanor, the sentence shall be
2
3
modified to a term that does not exceed the current maximum
3
4
sentence.

3
4
enters an order directing the offender to pay restitution to any

5
6
assessments, the order, for purposes of validity and collection,
6
7

15
with the supervision of the state until fully satisfied, and the

1
2
following considerations:
2
3
a. the nature and amount of restitution shall be
3
4
sufficient to restore the crime victim to the
4
5

17
a direct result of the crime, including out-of-pocket
17
18

17
18
provide all or part of the requisite information prior to the

10
all or part of the requisite information prior to the sentencing,

alteration of the restitution order predicated on the undisclosed
13
14
information. The willful failure or refusal of the offender to
14
15
provide all or part of the requisite information prior to

18
19
deems necessary to set restitution and payment schedules at the time
19
20
of sentencing or may bifurcate the sentencing and defer the hearing

11
and shall not be limited to two (2) years. Provided further, any
11
12
supervision provided for in this section may be extended for a

Req. No. 1320 Page 31

1
revocation is filed by the district attorney with the clerk of the
1
2
sentencing court and competent evidence justifying the revocation of
2
3
the suspended sentence is presented to the court at a hearing to be
3
4
held for that purpose within twenty (20) days after the entry of the
4
5
plea of not guilty to the petition, unless waived by both the state
5
6
and the defendant. The State of Oklahoma may dismiss the petition
6
7
without prejudice one time upon good cause shown to the court,
7
8
provided that any successor petition must be filed within forty-five
8
9
(45) days of the date of the dismissal of the petition.
9
10
B. Whenever a sentence has been suspended by the court after
10
11
conviction of a person for any crime, the suspended sentence of the
11
12
person may not be revoked in whole for a technical violation unless
12
13
a petition setting forth the grounds for such revocation is filed by
13
14
the district attorney with the clerk of the sentencing court and
14
15
competent evidence justifying the revocation of the suspended
15
16
sentence is presented to the court at a hearing to be held for that
16
17
purpose within twenty (20) days after the entry of the plea of not
17
18
guilty to the petition, unless waived by both the state and the
18
19
defendant. The State of Oklahoma may dismiss the petition without
19
20
prejudice one time upon good cause shown to the court; provided,
20
21
that any successor petition must be filed within forty-five (45)
21
22
days of the date of the dismissal of the petition. Any revocation
22
23
of a suspended sentence based on a technical violation shall not
23
24
24
Req. No. 1320 Page 32

1
exceed six (6) months for a first revocation and five (5) years for
1
2

2
3
C. “Technical violation” as used in this section means a
3

5
other than:

17
18
D. 1. The Department of Corrections shall develop a matrix of
18
19
technical violations and sanctions to address violations committed
19
20
by persons who are being supervised by the Department. The
20
21
Department shall be authorized to use a violation response and
21
22
intermediate sanction process based on the sanction matrix to apply
22
23
to any technical violations of probationers. Within four (4)
23
24
working days of the discovery of the violation, the probation
24
Req. No. 1320 Page 33

1
officer shall initiate the violation response and intermediate
1
2
sanction process. The sentencing judge may authorize any
2
3
recommended sanctions, which may include, but are not limited to:
3
4
short-term jail or lockup, day treatment, program attendance,
4
5
community service, outpatient or inpatient treatment, monetary
5
6
fines, curfews, ignition interlock devices on vehicles, or a one-
6
7
time referral to a term of confinement of six (6) months in an
7
8
intermediate revocation facility operated by the Department of
8
9
Corrections; provided, upon approval of the district attorney, a
9
10
person may be sanctioned to serve additional terms of confinement in
10
11
an intermediate revocation facility. The probation officer shall
11
12
complete a sanction form, which shall specify the technical
12
13
violation, sanction, and the action plan to correct the noncompliant
13
14
behavior resulting in the technical violation. The probation
14
15
officer shall refer to the sanctioning matrix to determine the
15
16
supervision, treatment, and sanctions appropriate to address the
16
17
noncompliant behavior. The probation officer shall refer the
17
18
violation information and recommended response with a sanction plan
18
19
to the Department of Corrections to be heard by a hearing officer.
19
20
The Department of Corrections shall develop a sanction matrix,
20
21
forms, policies and procedures necessary to implement this
21
22
provision. The Department of Corrections shall establish procedures
22
23
to hear responses to technical violations and review sanction plans
23
24
including the following:
24
Req. No. 1320 Page 34

1
a. hearing officers shall report through a chain of
1
2
command separate from that of the supervising
2
3
probation officers,
3
4
b. the Department shall provide the offender written
4
5
notice of the violation, the evidence relied upon, and
5
6
the reason the sanction was imposed,
6
7
c. the hearing shall be held unless the offender waives
7
8
the right to the hearing,
8
9
d. hearings shall be electronically recorded, and
9
10
e. the Department shall provide to judges and district
10
11
attorneys a record of all violations and actions taken
11
12
pursuant to this subsection.
12
13
2. The hearing officer shall determine based on a preponderance
13
14
of the evidence whether a technical violation occurred. Upon a
14
15
finding that a technical violation occurred, the hearing officer may
15
16
order the offender to participate in the recommended sanction plan
16
17
or may modify the plan. Offenders who accept the sanction plan
17
18
shall sign a violation response sanction form, and the hearing
18
19
officer shall then impose the sanction. Failure of the offender to
19
20
comply with the imposed sanction plan shall constitute a violation
20
21
of the rules and conditions of supervision that may result in a
21
22
revocation proceeding. If an offender does not voluntarily accept
22
23
the recommended sanction plan, the Department shall either impose
23
24
the sanction and allow the offender to appeal to the district court,
24
Req. No. 1320 Page 35

1
or request a revocation proceeding as provided by law. Every
1
2
administrative hearing and sanction imposed by the Department shall
2
3
be appealable to the district court.
3
4
3. Absent a finding of willful nonpayment by the offender, the
4
5
failure of an offender to pay fines and costs may not serve as a
5
6
basis for revocation, excluding restitution.
6
7
E. 1. Where one of the grounds for revocation is the failure
7
8
of the defendant to make restitution as ordered, the Department of
8
9
Corrections shall forward to the district attorney all information
9
10
pertaining to the failure of the defendant to make timely
10
11
restitution as ordered by the court, and the district attorney shall
11
12
file a petition setting forth the grounds for revocation.
12
13
2. The defendant ordered to make restitution can petition the
13
14
court at any time for remission or a change in the terms of the
14
15
order of restitution if the defendant undergoes a change of
15
16
condition which materially affects the ability of the defendant to
16
17
comply with the order of the court.
17
18
3. At the hearing, if one of the grounds for the petition for
18
19
revocation is the failure of the defendant to make timely
19
20
restitution as ordered by the court, the court will hear evidence
20
21
and if it appears to the satisfaction of the court from such
21
22
evidence that the terms of the order of restitution create a
22
23
manifest hardship on the defendant or the immediate family of the
23
24
defendant, the court may cancel all or any part of the amount still
24
Req. No. 1320 Page 36

1
due, or modify the terms or method of payment; provided, however,
1
2
the court shall continue to prioritize an order for payments of
2
3
restitution to the victim to the extent feasible. Provided, if the
3
4
court determines that a reduction in the restitution still due is
4
5
warranted, the court shall equally apply the same percentage
5
6
reduction to any court-ordered monetary obligation owed by the
6
7
defendant including, but not limited to, fines, court costs and
7
8
costs of incarceration.
8
9
F. The court may revoke a portion of the sentence and leave the
9
10
remaining part not revoked, but suspended for the remainder of the
10
11
term of the sentence, and under the provisions applying to it. The
11
12
person whose suspended sentence is being considered for revocation
12
13
at the hearing shall have the right to be represented by counsel, to
13
14
present competent evidence in his or her own behalf and to be
14
15
confronted by the witnesses against the defendant. Any order of the
15
16
court revoking the suspended sentence, in whole or in part, shall be
16
17
subject to review on appeal, as in other appeals of criminal cases.
17
18
Provided, however, that if the crime for which the suspended
18
19
sentence is given was a felony, the defendant may be allowed bail
19
20
pending appeal. If the reason for revocation be that the defendant
20
21
committed a felony, the defendant shall not be allowed bail pending
21
22
appeal.
22
23
G. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections A and B of
23
24
this section, when the suspended sentence of a person is being
24
Req. No. 1320 Page 37

1
considered for revocation for an offense where the penalty has
1
2
subsequently been lowered to a misdemeanor, the sentence shall be
2
3
modified to a term that does not exceed the current maximum
3
4
sentence.

5
SECTION 3. AMENDATORY 22 O.S. 2021, Section 991f, is
5
6
amended to read as follows:
6
7
Section 991f. A. For the purposes of any provision of Title 22
7

of the Oklahoma Statutes relating to criminal sentencing and
8
9
restitution orders and for the Restitution and Diversion Program:
9
10
1. “Restitution” means the sum to be paid by the defendant to
10
11
the victim of the criminal act to compensate that victim for up to
11
12
three times the amount of the economic loss suffered as a direct
12
13
result of the criminal act of the defendant;
13
14
2. “Victim” means any person, partnership, corporation or legal
14
15
entity that suffers an economic loss as a direct result of the
15
16
criminal act of another person; and
16
17
3. “Economic loss” means actual financial detriment suffered by
17
18
the victim consisting of medical expenses actually incurred, damage
18
19
to or loss of real and personal property and any other out-of-pocket
19
20
expenses, including loss of earnings, reasonably incurred as the

22
23
purposes of this section.
23
24
24
Req. No. 1320 Page 38

1
B. In all criminal prosecutions and juvenile proceedings in
1
2
this state, when the court shall prioritize an order for payments of
2
3
restitution to the victim to the extent feasible. When the court
3
4
enters an order directing the offender to pay restitution to any
4
5
victim for economic loss or to pay to the state any fines, fees or
5
6
assessments, the order, for purposes of validity and collection,
6
7
shall not be limited to the maximum term of imprisonment for which
7
8
the offender could have been sentenced, nor limited to any term of
8
9
probation, parole, or extension thereof, nor expire until fully
9
10
satisfied. The court order for restitution, fines, fees or
10
11
assessments shall remain a continuing obligation of the offender
11
12
until fully satisfied, and the obligation shall not be considered a
12
13
debt, nor shall the obligation be dischargeable in any bankruptcy
13
14
proceeding. The court order shall continue in full force and effect
14
15
with the supervision of the state until fully satisfied, and the
15
16
state shall use all methods of collection authorized by law.
16
17
C. 1. Upon conviction for any crime wherein property has been
17
18
stolen, converted or otherwise unlawfully obtained, or its value
18
19
substantially decreased as a direct result of the crime, or wherein
19
20
the crime victim suffered injury, loss of income, or out-of-pocket
20
21
loss, the individuals criminally responsible shall be sentenced to
21
22
make restitution. Restitution may be ordered in addition to the
22
23
punishments prescribed by law.
23
24
24
Req. No. 1320 Page 39

1
2. The court shall order full restitution based upon the
1
2
following considerations:
2
3
a. the nature and amount of restitution shall be
3
4
sufficient to restore the crime victim to the
4
5
equivalent economic status existing prior to the
5
6
losses sustained as a direct result of the crime, and
6
7
may allow the crime victim to receive payment in
7
8
excess of the losses sustained; provided, the excess
8
9
amount of restitution shall not be more than treble
9
10
the actual economic loss incurred, and
10
11
b. the amount of restitution shall be established
11
12
regardless of the financial resources of the offender.
12
13
3. The court:
13
14
a. may direct the return of property to be made as soon
14
15
as practicable and make an award of restitution in the
15
16
amount of the loss of value to the property itself as
16
17
a direct result of the crime, including out-of-pocket
17
18
expenses and loss of earnings incurred as a result of
18
19
damage to or loss of use of the property, the cost to
19
20
return the property to the victim or to restore the
20
21
property to its pre-crime condition whichever may be
21
22
appropriate under the circumstances,
22
23
b. may order restitution in a lump sum or by such
23
24
schedules as may be established and thereafter
24
Req. No. 1320 Page 40

1
adjusted by agreement consistent with the order of the
1
2
court,
2
3
c. shall have the authority to amend or alter any order
3
4
of restitution made pursuant to this section providing
4
5
that the court shall state its reasons and conclusions
5
6
as a matter of record for any change or amendment to
6
7
any previous order,
7
8
d. may order interest upon any ordered restitution sum to
8
9
accrue at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum

19
20
set at the same time, the court shall establish the following
20
21
priorities of payment:
21
22
1. The crime victim or victims; and
22
23
2. Any other government agency which has provided reimbursement
23
24
to the victim as a result of the offender’s criminal conduct.
24
Req. No. 1320 Page 41

1
E. 1. The district attorney’s office shall present the crime
1
2

4
5
which case, the restitution claim shall be reviewed by the judge

prior to acceptance of the plea agreement.

13
victims, regardless of whether the crime victim makes a specific

15
16

provided assistance and direction to properly complete the form.
20
21
4. The official restitution request form shall be presented in
21
22
all cases regardless of whether the case is brought to trial. In a
22
23
plea bargain, the district attorney in every case where the victim
23
24
has suffered economic loss, shall, as a part of the plea bargain,
24
Req. No. 1320 Page 42

3
collection and disbursement of restitution payments made pursuant to
3
4
this section, and shall assess a fee of One Dollar ($1.00) per

effect of a district court judgment in a civil case. Thereupon the
2
3
same remedies shall be available for the enforcement of the judgment

15
16
failure to comply.

shall be used by the court as sanctions and means of collection for
19
20
criminal restitution orders and restitution orders that have been
20
21
