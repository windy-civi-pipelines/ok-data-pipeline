1
2
school year, and each school year thereafter, each school district
2
3
shall have its initial allocation of State Aid calculated based on
3
4
the state dedicated revenues actually collected during the preceding
4
5
fiscal year, the adjusted assessed valuation of the preceding year,
5
6
and the weighted average daily membership (ADM) for the school
6
7
district based on the first nine (9) weeks of the preceding current
7
8
school year. Each school district shall submit the following data
8
9
based on the first nine (9) weeks, to be used in the calculation of
9
10
the average daily membership of the school district:
10
11
1. Student enrollment by grade level;
11
12
2. Pupil category counts; and
12
13
3. Transportation supplement data.
13
14
On or before December 30, the State Department of Education
14
15
shall determine each school district’s current year allocation
15
16
pursuant to subsection D of this section. The State Department of
16
17
Education shall complete an audit, using procedures established by
17
18
the Department, of the student enrollment by grade level data, pupil

category counts, and transportation supplement data to be used in
19
20
the State Aid Formula pursuant to subsection D of this section by
20
21
December 1 and by January 15 shall notify each school district of

8
9
for financial support of schools, to be used to make midyear

20
pursuant to the provisions of subsection G of this section and
20
21
Section 18-112.2 of this title; provided, no district having per

reimbursements, recovery of overpayments and refunds, unused
6
7
reserves, prior expenditures recovered, prior year surpluses, and
7
8
less the amount of any transfer fees paid in that year.

21
22
Program and adding to this difference the Transportation Supplement.
22
23
a. The Foundation Program shall be a district’s higher
23
24

8
less than the amount of funds claimed for reimbursement by the
8
9
school district due to insufficiency of funds as provided in Section
9
10
193 of Title 62 of the Oklahoma Statutes, then the school district’s
10
11
assessed valuation for the school year that such ad valorem
11
12
reimbursement is calculated in the State Aid Formula shall be
12
13
adjusted accordingly.

B. Beginning with the 2022-2023 2026-2027 school year, the
11
12
weighted calculations provided for in subsection A of this section
12
13
shall be based on the higher weighted average daily membership of
13
14
the first nine (9) weeks of the current school year or the preceding
14
15
school year of a school district, unless otherwise specified. The
15
16
higher of the two (2) weighted average daily memberships membership
16
17
shall be used consistently in all of the calculations; however, the
17
18
weighted calculation for a statewide virtual charter school
18
19
experiencing a significant decline in membership shall be based on
19
20
the first nine (9) weeks of the current school year for the
20
21
statewide virtual charter school. For purposes of this subsection,
21
22
“significant decline in membership” means equal to or greater than a
22
23
fifteen percent (15%) decrease in average daily membership from the
23
24
preceding school year to the average daily membership of the first
24
Req. No. 1360 Page 17

Multiply the membership of each subparagraph of this paragraph by
20
21
the weight assigned to such subparagraph of this paragraph and add
21
22
the totals together to determine the weighted pupil grade level
22

23
24
eligible for the early childhood program weight shall be pursuant to
24
Req. No. 1360 Page 18

1
the provisions of Section 1-114 of this title. The pupils eligible
1

for the out-of-home placement pupil weight shall be students who are
2
3
not residents of the school district in which they are receiving
3
4
education pursuant to the provisions of subsection D of Section 1-
4
5
113 of this title. Such weight may be claimed by the district
5
6
providing educational services to such student for the days that
6
7
student is enrolled in that district. If claimed, the out-of-home
7
8
placement weight shall be in lieu of the pupil grade level and any
8
9
pupil category weights for that student. Provided, if a student
9
10
resides in a juvenile detention center that is restricted to less
10
11
than twelve (12) beds, the out-of-home placement pupil weight for
11
12
such students shall be calculated as follows: for a center with six
12

14
Except as otherwise provided, multiply the number of pupils approved
14
15
in the school year with the highest average daily membership in each
15
16
category by the weight assigned to such category and add the totals
16
17
together to determine the weighted pupil category calculation for a
17
18
school district. For the 1997-98 school year and subsequent school
18
19
years, the number to be multiplied by the weight assigned to the
19
20
gifted category in subparagraph g of this paragraph shall be the
20
21
lesser of (1) the sum of the number of students who scored in the
21
22
top three percent (3%) on any national standardized test of
22
23
intellectual ability plus the number of students identified as
23
24
gifted pursuant to subparagraphs a through d of paragraph 1 of
24
Req. No. 1360 Page 20

formula, applying whichever is the greater of the calculations of
9
10
the two formulas and then applying the restrictions pursuant to
10
11
subparagraph c of this paragraph.
11
12
a. Small school district formula: 750 minus the average
12
13
daily membership divided by 750 times .2 times total
13
14
average daily membership.
14
15
The small school district formula calculation shall apply
15
16
only to school districts whose highest average daily
16
17
membership is less than 750 pupils. School districts which
17
18
are consolidated or annexed after July 1, 2003, pursuant to
18
19
the Oklahoma School Voluntary Consolidation and Annexation
19
20
Act shall have the weighted district size calculation for
20
21
the three (3) school years following the fiscal year in
21
22
which such consolidation occurred calculated to be the sum
22
23
of the individual consolidated districts computed as if the
23
24
consolidation had not taken place. Thereafter, any such
24
Req. No. 1360 Page 21

1
district which is consolidated pursuant to the Oklahoma
1
2
School Voluntary Consolidation and Annexation Act shall not
2
3
qualify for the weighted district calculation unless the
3
4
district can satisfy the specifications herein. Subject to
4
5
the provisions of subparagraph c of this paragraph, the
5
6
resulting number shall be counted as additional students
6
7
for the purpose of calculating State Aid.
7
8
b. District sparsity - isolation formula:
8
9
The district sparsity - isolation formula calculation shall
9
10
apply only to school districts:
10
11
(1) whose total area in square miles is greater than
11
12
the average number of square miles for all school
12
13
districts in this state;, and
13
14
(2) whose areal density is less than one-fourth (1/4)
14
15
of the state average areal density. Areal
15
16
density shall be determined by dividing the
16
17
school district’s average daily membership by the
17
18
school district’s total area in square miles.
18
19
The district sparsity - isolation formula calculation shall
19
20
be calculated as follows:
20
21
The school district student cost factor multiplied by
21
22
the school district area factor. The resulting
22
23
product shall be multiplied by the school district’s
23
24
average daily membership. Subject to the provisions
24
Req. No. 1360 Page 22

1
of subparagraph c of this paragraph, the resulting
1
2
number shall be counted as additional students for the
2

purpose of calculating State Aid.
3
4
The school district student cost factor shall be calculated
4
5
as follows:
5
6
The school district’s average daily membership shall
6
7
be categorized into the following grade level groups
7
8
and applied to the appropriate formulas as computed
8

average daily membership. The number one (1.0) shall
4
5
be subtracted from the resulting quotient.
5
6
The school district area cost factor shall be calculated as
6
7
follows:
7
8
Subtract the state average district area from the
8
9
district area, then divide the remainder by the state
9
10
average district area;
10
11
however, the district area cost factor shall not exceed one
11
12
(1.0).
12
13
The State Board of Education shall define geographical barriers
13
14
whose location in a school district would inhibit the district from
14
15
consolidation or annexation. The Board shall make available an
15
16
application process, review applications, and for districts the
16
17
Board deems necessary allow additional square miles to be used for
17
18
the purposes of calculations used for the weighted district sparsity
18
19
- isolation formula. Provided, that the additional square miles
19
20
allowed for geographical barriers shall not exceed thirty percent
20
21
(30%) of the district’s actual size.
21
22
c. State Aid funds which a district is calculated to
22
23
receive as a result of the weighted district
23
24
calculation shall be restricted as follows:
24
Req. No. 1360 Page 24

applied, the district’s projected per pupil
2
3
revenue exceeds one hundred fifty percent (150%)
3
4
of the projected state average per pupil revenue,
4
5
then the district’s State Aid shall be reduced by
5
6
an amount that will restrict the district’s
6
7
projected per pupil revenue to one hundred fifty
7
8
percent (150%) of the projected state average per
8
9
pupil revenue. Provided, in applying the
9
10
restriction provided in this division, the
10
11
district’s State Aid shall not be reduced by an
11
12
amount greater than by the amount of State Aid
12
13
which was generated by the weighted district
13
14
calculation.
14
15
The July calculation of the projected per pupil
15
16
revenue shall be determined by dividing the district’s
16
17
preceding year’s average daily membership (ADM) for
17
18
the first nine (9) weeks of the current school year as
18
19
