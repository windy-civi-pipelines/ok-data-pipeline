5 or specific terms thereof, may be vacated or modified prior to or in

7 facts necessary for vacation or modification. Temporary orders and
8 the automatic temporary injunction terminate when the final judgment
9 on all issues, except attorney fees and costs, is rendered or when
10 the action is dismissed. The court may reserve jurisdiction to rule
11 on an application for a contempt citation for a violation of a
12 temporary order or the automatic temporary injunction which is filed
13 any time prior to the time the temporary order or injunction
14 terminates.
15 D. Upon granting a decree of dissolution of marriage, annulment
16 of a marriage, or legal separation, the court may require either
17 party to pay such reasonable expenses of the other as may be just
18 and proper under the circumstances.
19 E. The court may in its discretion make additional orders
20 relative to the expenses of any such subsequent actions, including
21 but not limited to writs of habeas corpus, brought by the parties or
22 their attorneys, for the enforcement or modification of any
23 interlocutory or final orders in the dissolution of marriage action
24 made for the benefit of either party or their respective attorneys.

1 domestic abuse wherein the moving party or a child of
2 the party alleging domestic abuse is the victim,
3 the court shall set a hearing upon application within ten (10) days
4 of filing from the date that the application for a temporary order
5 is presented to the court for scheduling by the moving party, with
6 the moving party providing five (5) days’ notice of hearing to the
7 nonmoving party unless waived by both parties, and memorialized by
8 an order of the court. The court shall conduct a substantive
9 hearing and issue a ruling on custody, visitation, child support,

15 basis of a verified application and testimony of witnesses that
16 irreparable harm will result to the moving party, or a child of a
17 party if no order is issued before the adverse party or attorney for

19 temporary restraining order which shall become immediately effective
20 and enforceable without requiring notice and opportunity to be heard
21 to the other party. Provided, for the purposes of this section, no
22 minor child or children temporarily residing in a licensed,
23 certified domestic violence shelter in the state shall be removed by
24 an ex parte order. If a temporary restraining order is issued

5 or specific terms thereof, may be vacated or modified prior to or in
6 conjunction with a final decree on a showing by either party of
7 facts necessary for vacation or modification. Temporary orders and
8 the automatic temporary injunction terminate when the final judgment
9 on all issues, except attorney fees and costs, is rendered or when
10 the action is dismissed. The court may reserve jurisdiction to rule
11 on an application for a contempt citation for a violation of a
12 temporary order or the automatic temporary injunction which is filed
13 any time prior to the time the temporary order or injunction
14 terminates.
15 D. Upon granting a decree of dissolution of marriage, annulment
16 of a marriage, or legal separation, the court may require either
17 party to pay such reasonable expenses of the other as may be just
18 and proper under the circumstances.

20 relative to the expenses of any such subsequent actions, including
21 but not limited to writs of habeas corpus, brought by the parties or
22 their attorneys, for the enforcement or modification of any
23 interlocutory or final orders in the dissolution of marriage action
24 made for the benefit of either party or their respective attorneys.
