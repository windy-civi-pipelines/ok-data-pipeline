Req. No. 937 Page 9

served on the other party in any manner provided for in the Rules of

3
2. A temporary order. If domestic abuse is not alleged, when
3
4
setting a hearing to enter temporary orders, the court shall conduct
4
5
a substantive hearing and issue a ruling on custody, visitation,
5
6
child support, and other ancillary matters, including property. The
6
7
court shall schedule the hearing to take place within thirty (30)
7
8
days from the date that the application for temporary orders is
8
9
presented to the court for scheduling by the moving party, unless
9
10
the parties agree in writing to waive this requirement, and said
10
11
agreement is memorialized by an order of the court. The moving
11
12
party shall provide at least five (5) days’ notice of hearing to the
12
13
nonmoving party;

14
15
any party alleging acts of domestic abuse, as defined by Section 109
15
16
of this title, against the other party, or the minor child or
16
17
children at issue and either of the following are present:
17
18
a. the moving party has been granted a temporary or
18
19
permanent order of protection against the other party
19
20
for domestic abuse committed against the moving party
20
21
or the minor child or children at issue, or
21
22
b. the party against whom domestic violence has been
22
23
alleged has been charged in any criminal proceeding,
23
24
within the past five (5) years, with an act of
24
Req. No. 937 Page 10

1
domestic abuse wherein the moving party or a child of
1
2
the party alleging domestic abuse is the victim,
2
3
the court shall set a hearing upon application within ten (10) days
3
4
of filing from the date that the application for a temporary order
4
5
is presented to the court for scheduling by the moving party, with
5
6
the moving party providing five (5) days’ notice of hearing to the
6
7
nonmoving party unless waived by both parties, and memorialized by
7
8
an order of the court. The court shall conduct a substantive
8
9
hearing and issue a ruling on custody, visitation, child support,
9
10
and other ancillary matters, including property. The requesting
10
11
party shall attach a certified copy of the emergency protective
11
12
order, probable cause affidavit, or charging information, if
12
13
available, to the temporary orders application; and
13
14
4. A temporary restraining order. If the court finds on the
14
15
basis of a verified application and testimony of witnesses that
15
16
irreparable harm will result to the moving party, or a child of a
16
17
party if no order is issued before the adverse party or attorney for
17
18
the adverse party can be heard in opposition, the court may issue a
18
19
temporary restraining order which shall become immediately effective
19
20
and enforceable without requiring notice and opportunity to be heard
20
21
to the other party. Provided, for the purposes of this section, no
21
22
minor child or children temporarily residing in a licensed,
22
23
certified domestic violence shelter in the state shall be removed by
23
24
an ex parte order. If a temporary restraining order is issued
24
Req. No. 937 Page 11

1
pursuant to this paragraph, the motion for a temporary order shall
1
2
be set within ten (10) days, but such hearing shall not be heard
2
3
unless five (5) days’ notice of hearing is given to the other party.
3
4
C. Any temporary orders and the automatic temporary injunction,
4
5
or specific terms thereof, may be vacated or modified prior to or in
5
6
conjunction with a final decree on a showing by either party of
6
7
facts necessary for vacation or modification. Temporary orders and
7
8
the automatic temporary injunction terminate when the final judgment
8
9
on all issues, except attorney fees and costs, is rendered or when
9
10
the action is dismissed. The court may reserve jurisdiction to rule
10
11
on an application for a contempt citation for a violation of a
11
12
temporary order or the automatic temporary injunction which is filed
12
13
any time prior to the time the temporary order or injunction
13
14
terminates.
14
15
D. Upon granting a decree of dissolution of marriage, annulment
15
16
of a marriage, or legal separation, the court may require either
16
17
party to pay such reasonable expenses of the other as may be just
17
18
and proper under the circumstances.
18
19
E. The court may in its discretion make additional orders
19
20
relative to the expenses of any such subsequent actions, including
20
21
but not limited to writs of habeas corpus, brought by the parties or
21
22
their attorneys, for the enforcement or modification of any
22
23
interlocutory or final orders in the dissolution of marriage action
23
24
made for the benefit of either party or their respective attorneys.
