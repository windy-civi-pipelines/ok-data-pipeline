A Resolution proclaiming February 18, 2025, as
the industry’s economic impact; and recognizing the
importance of aggregates for local infrastructure.
WHEREAS, Oklahoma’s economy depends on quality infrastructure –
from highways, roads, streets, and bridges to home foundations,
office walls, glass for all uses, and fracking sand that powers
Oklahoma’s oil and natural gas industry; and
WHEREAS, all those critical economic outcomes begin with the
production and use of aggregates – the rock, sand, gravel, and
gypsum that lays the foundation for all infrastructure; and
WHEREAS, aggregates in Oklahoma is a nearly $1 billion industry,
supporting 8,450 jobs and $457 million in annual employee
compensation, paying 20% higher-than-average Oklahoma wages; and
WHEREAS, Oklahoma aggregates are the primary construction
material used by the Department of Transportation, Oklahoma Turnpike
Authority, and county, city, and tribal governments, as well as real
estate developers and homebuilders.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE OF THE 1ST SESSION
OF THE 60TH OKLAHOMA LEGISLATURE:
THAT the Oklahoma State Senate declares February 18, 2025, as
Oklahoma Aggregates Day at the Capitol.
