16 (4) 6000 Hz at 20dB; or
17 3. For an otoacoustic emissions device (OAE) device:
18 a. measure responses of the cochlea to no less than four
19 test frequencies, and
20 b. device display screen indicates pass for all four
21 frequencies;
22 All equipment shall meet the American National Standards
23 Institute (ANSI) standards and manufacturer specifications. This
24 equipment shall be calibrated annually and shall meet the

4 Schools opting to use speech screenings must use a tablet
5 meeting the same ANSI standards as an audiometer and an evidence-

7 speech software, or any new hearing screening tool determined by the
8 Department to be a comparable screening tool that utilizes both
9 methods.
10 C. The following hearing acuity criteria shall be used as a
11 basis for referring a child for further evaluation by an
12 audiologist:
13 1. Refer on a clinically validated tablet-based auditory
14 assessment software using both high-frequency pure tones and speech
15 testing for two screenings and/or referring the pure tone
16 frequencies at any frequency in one or both ears;

14 district chooses a more rapid implementation. The gradient method
15 and timeline is listed as follows:
16 1. First year hearing screenings for children shall begin in
17 2026 and may include any of the methods listed therein. Any child
