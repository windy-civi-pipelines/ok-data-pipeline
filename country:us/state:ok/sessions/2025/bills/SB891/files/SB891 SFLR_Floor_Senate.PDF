1 cutt ing, milling, or similar procedure, and may be cleaned or
2 sterilized using standard treatments applied to food ingredients,
3 such as heat, steam, pressurization, or irradiation or other
4 standard treatments applied to food ingredients. The total alkaloid

6 exceed three and one-half percent (3.5%) measured on a dried weight-
7 to-weight basis;
8 3. “Kratom leaf extract” means the material obtained by
9 extracting kratom using a solvent consisting of:

1 tota l kratom alkaloids, as confirmed with a high-performance liquid
2 chromatography testing method. For purposes of this paragraph,

4 or biosynthetic chemistry, as opposed to traditional food
5 preparation techniques such as heating or extracting;
6 5. “Total kratom alkaloids” means the sum of mitragynine,
