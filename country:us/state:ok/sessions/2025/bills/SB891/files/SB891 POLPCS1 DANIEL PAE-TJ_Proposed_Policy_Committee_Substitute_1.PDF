8 cutting, milling, or similar procedure, and may be cleaned or
9 sterilized using standard treatments applied to food ingredients,
10 such as heat, steam, pressurization, or irradiation or other
11 standard treatments applied to food ingredients. The total alkaloid
12 content of kratom leaf material used in the kratom product shall not
13 exceed three and one-half percent (3.5%) measured on a dried weight-
14 to-weight basis;
15 3. “Kratom leaf extract” means the material obtained by
16 extracting kratom using a solvent consisting of:

20 The extracted material shall contain mitragynine as the most
21 abundant alkaloid, measured on a weight-to-weight basis, and at a

9 total kratom alkaloids, as confirmed with a high-performance liquid
10 chromatography testing method. For purposes of this paragraph,
11 “synthesized” refers to substances produced using directed synthetic
12 or biosynthetic chemistry, as opposed to traditional food
