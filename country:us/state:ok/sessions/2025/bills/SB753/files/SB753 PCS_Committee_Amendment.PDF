16 incurred by the requirements of this act.

2 of crop rent from comparable agricultural land
3 for the five-year period preceding the appraisal.
4 b. The appraisers shall reconcile the variables to arrive
5 at their estimation of fair market rental value of the
6 land; provided, that they shall give weighted
7 preference to comparable cash rentals charged on other
8 lands of the same or similar quality in the area.
9 Appraisals conducted pursuant to this paragraph shall not exceed
10 those rates associated with the Conservation Stewardship Program
11 implemented by the United States Natural Resources Conservation
12 Service.
13 E. 1. Upon a first violation of this section, the
14 Commissioners of the Land Office shall provide a written notice to
15 the lessee specifying the violations and providing the lessee ninety
16 (90) days after notice to correct the violation.

21 b. evict the lessee from the property, and
