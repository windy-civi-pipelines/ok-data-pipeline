18 SECTION 1. NEW LAW A new section of law not to be
19 codified in the Oklahoma Statutes reads as follows:
20 The Legislature finds that construction and operation of wind
21 turbines and construction of the towers used in connection with wind
22 turbines is a matter which is the proper subject of legislation.
23 The Legislature finds that the height of towers used to support
24 commercial wind turbines for production of electrical energy by
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2751 Page 1
1 mean s of wind power is a potential issue with respect to setback
2 limitations and that there is a need for uniformity in areas of the
3 state likely to be affected by the construction and operation of
4 towers and wind turbines. The Legislature finds that consideration
5 of population density and average wind speed are a logical basis in
6 order to enact legislation related to setback requirements for the
7 structures used in the wind energy industry that pose risks related
8 to either persons or property or both in the event of damage to the
9 structures or structural failures.
10 SECTION 2. NEW LAW A new section of law to be codified
11 in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 160.21.1 of Title 17, unless
12 there is created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:
13 A. As used in this act:
14 1. "Affected county" means a county having a population density
15 greater than eight and five-tenths (8.5) persons per square mile
16 according to the 2020 Federal Decennial Census or most recent
17 population estimate and a county which has an average wind speed of
18 less than nine and five-tenths (9.5) miles per hour according to the
19 most recent climatology documents by county from the Oklahoma
20 Climatological Survey as of the effective date of this act;
21 2. "Dwelling" means a structure occupied by one or more persons
22 for at least six (6) months during a single calendar year or which
23 is occupied by one or more persons for an average of more than fifty
24 percent (50%) of the time during any other period of time in excess
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2751 Page 2
1 of o ne (1) year. As used in this section, dwelling shall not
2 include a motor home or recreational vehicle;
3 3. "Improvement to real property" means a residential dwelling
4 or a building used or suitable for use by a for-profit or nonprofit
5 entity. As used in this act, "improvement" shall not include a
6 fence;
7 4. "Industrial wind turbine" means a device used for the
8 production of electrical energy by means of wind;
9 5. "Substantial construction activity" means movement or
10 grading of earth at the site of a tower and pouring of concrete or
11 installation of material designed to support the weight of a tower
12 or both such activities and shall require due diligence and the
13 conduct of activity which is continuous without any cessation of
14 such activity for a period in excess of sixty (60) days;
15 6. "Tip height" means the highest measurable point of a tower
16 upon which an industrial wind turbine is installed or is capable of
17 being installed, including the height of the turbine itself without
18 regard to any period of time during which a turbine is removed from
19 the tower; and
20 7. "Tower" means a vertical structure used in order to support
21 an industrial wind turbine.
22 B. Except as provided by Section 160.20 of Title 17 of the
23 Oklahoma Statutes, except as provided by subsection C of this
24 section, in an affected county on or after the effective date of
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2751 Page 3
1 this act, a tower or similar structure used in connection with an
2 industrial wind turbine shall not be located:
3 1. Any closer than a distance of one and one-half (1 1/2) times
4 the tip height of the tower. For purposes of this paragraph, the
5 distance shall be measured from the point on the property line of
6 the parcel of real property upon which the tower is located, which
7 is nearest to the point on a property line of any parcel of real
8 property affected by the provisions of this act; or
9 2. Any closer than one-half (1/2) nautical mile from the
10 nearest point of a dwelling structure.
11 C. An owner of real property that would otherwise be subject to
12 the provisions of this act with respect to a setback distance
13 applicable to a tower may waive the otherwise applicable setback
14 requirement. In order to exercise the waiver authorized by this
15 subsection, a point along the property line of a parcel of real
16 property shall be required to be within a distance of one and one-
17 half (1 1/2) times the tip height of the tower or a tower must be
18 located within one-half (1/2) mile of a dwelling structure. If an
19 owner of real property executes a lease with a wind energy company
20 to allow placement of a tower or other wind energy assets on such
21 real property, the execution of the lease agreement shall constitute
22 a waiver pursuant to this subsection.
23 D. 1. The provisions of subsection B of this section shall
24 continue to be applicable to the construction of a tower or similar
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2751 Page 4
1 stru cture used in connection with an industrial wind turbine unless
2 a majority of the qualified electors of a county voting on a
3 question submitted for such purpose by the board of county
4 commissioners of the county approve the adoption of the setback
5 limitations as prescribed by subsection B of this section or a
6 modification or elimination of the setback limitation as prescribed
7 by subsection B of this section with respect to a tower constructed
8 on or after the effective date specified in the question submitted
9 to the voters.
10 2. In addition to the referral of the question pursuant to
11 paragraph 1 of this subsection, the question may also be submitted
12 to the voters of the county if a petition, signed by at least ten
13 percent (10%) of the number of voters who voted in the last
14 presidential election, is filed with the county clerk of the county.

16 often than once each five (5) years.

4 supersede such zoning provisions.
5 H. Except as otherwise provided by subsection I of this
6 section, a wind energy company shall have a total period of four (4)
7 years in order to begin substantial construction activity of a wind
8 energy project. The time period shall be computed from the first
9 date as of which the wind energy company is contractually assured of
10 the ability to make an interconnection to the segment of the
11 national electric grid located within the state for which the
12 Southwest Power Pool is responsible.
13 I. If a wind energy company has had contractual assurance of
14 the ability to make such interconnection as described in subsection
15 H of this section or a wind energy company has established an actual
16 physical connection to the segment of the national electric grid
17 located within the state for which the Southwest Power Pool is
18 responsible for a period of three (3) or more years prior to the
19 effective date of this act, the wind energy company shall have a
20 period of twelve (12) months from the effective date of this act to
21 begin substantial construction activity.
22 SECTION 3. NEW LAW A new section of law to be codified
23 in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 160.21.2 of Title 17, unless
24 there is created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:
