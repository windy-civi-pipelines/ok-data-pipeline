19 BE IT ENACTED BY THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF OKLAHOMA:
20 SECTION 1. NEW LAW A new section of law not to be
21 codified in the Oklahoma Statutes reads as follows:
22 The Legislature finds that construction and operation of wind
23 turbines and construction of the towers used in connection with wind
24 turbines is a matter which is the proper subject of legislation.
Req. No. 13378 Page 1

1 The Legislature finds that the height of towers used to support
2 commercial wind turbines for production of electrical energy by
3 means of wind power is a potential issue with respect to setback
4 limitations and that there is a need for uniformity in areas of the
5 state likely to be affected by the construction and operation of
6 towers and wind turbines. The Legislature finds that consideration
7 of tip height and distance from both property lines and improvements
8 to real property are a logical basis in order to enact legislation
9 related to setback requirements for the structures used in the wind
10 energy industry that pose risks related to either persons or
11 property or both in the event of damage to the structures or
12 structural failures.
13 SECTION 2. NEW LAW A new section of law to be codified
14 in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 160.21.1 of Title 17, unless
15 there is created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:
16 A. As used in this act:
17 1. "Improvement to real property" means a residential dwelling
18 or a building used or suitable for use by a for-profit or nonprofit
19 entity. As used in this act, "improvement" shall not include a
20 fence;
21 2. "Industrial wind turbine" means a device used for the
22 production of electrical energy by means of wind;
23 3. "Tip height" means the highest measurable point of a tower
24 upon which an industrial wind turbine is installed or is capable of
Req. No. 13378 Page 2

1 bein g installed, including the height of the turbine itself without
2 regard to any period of time during which a turbine is removed from
3 the tower; and
4 4. "Tower" means a vertical structure used in order to support
5 an industrial wind turbine.
6 5. "Nonparticipating property line" means any property line for
7 an owner of real property who is not participating in the wind
8 energy facility project.
9 B. Except as provided by Section 160.20 of Title 17 of the
10 Oklahoma Statutes, except as provided by subsection C of this
11 section, and except as provided by subsection G of this section, in
12 a county on or after the effective date of this act, a tower or
13 similar structure used in connection with an industrial wind turbine
14 shall not be located any closer than a distance of four (4) times
15 the tip height of the tower or one-half (1/2) of the one (1)
16 nautical mile, whichever is greater, from a nonparticipating
17 property line and seven-eighths (7/8) of one (1) nautical mile to an
18 improvement of real property.
19 C. An owner of real property that would otherwise be subject to
20 the provisions of this act with respect to a setback distance
21 applicable to a tower may waive the otherwise applicable setback
22 requirement. In order to exercise the waiver authorized by this
23 subsection, a property line shall be required to be within a
24 distance of four (4) times the tip height of the tower or one-half
Req. No. 13378 Page 3

1 (1/2 ) of one (1) nautical mile, whichever is greater, or some part
2 of real property shall be required to be within seven-eighths (7/8)
3 of one (1) nautical mile, to be calculated as required by subsection
4 B of this section.
5 D. The provisions of subsection B of this section shall
6 continue to be applicable to the construction of a tower or similar
7 structure used in connection with an industrial wind turbine unless
8 a majority of the qualified electors of a county voting on a
9 question submitted for such purpose by the board of county
10 commissioners of the county approve a modification of the setback
11 limitation as prescribed by subsection B of this section with
12 respect to a tower constructed on or after the effective date
13 specified in the question submitted to the voters. The vote
14 authorized by this subsection may occur no more often than once each
15 five (5) years. The provisions of this subsection shall be
16 applicable to all counties regardless of any zoning and planning
17 commissions that are or are not in place now or in the future.
18 E. Subject to the limitations prescribed by subsection D of
19 this section, the question described by subsection D of this section
20 may be referred to a vote of the qualified electors of the county by
21 an affirmative vote of a majority of the board of county
22 commissioners or by a properly executed petition, as prescribed by
23 law, of the citizens of that county calling for a vote on the
24 question by the qualified electors of the county.
Req. No. 13378 Page 4

1 F. The provisions of this section shall be applicable to towers
2 the physical construction of which has not been fully completed upon
3 the effective date of this act, or begins on or after the effective
4 date of this act.

6 towers that have been fully constructed upon the effective date of
7 this act.
8 SECTION 3. NEW LAW A new section of law to be codified
9 in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 160.21.2 of Title 17, unless
10 there is created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:
11 The Oklahoma Corporation Commission shall maintain a publicly
12 accessible and searchable database containing the status of each
13 county of the state with respect to whether a setback provision is
14 in effect and the relevant information regarding the setback
15 provisions, including any applicable expiration date.
16 SECTION 4. It being immediately necessary for the preservation
17 of the public peace, health or safety, an emergency is hereby
18 declared to exist, by reason whereof this act shall take effect and
19 be in full force from and after its passage and approval.
