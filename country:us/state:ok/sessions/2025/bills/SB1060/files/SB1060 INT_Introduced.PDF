17
The Commissioner may require correction of any deficiencies in the

rate filing upon later review if the rate the carrier charged is
18
19
excessive, inadequate, or unfairly discriminatory. A prospective
19

22
deficiencies in the rate filing after a sixty-day period, the
22
23
Commissioner shall provide notice to the carrier, and the carrier
23
24
shall correct the rate on a prospective basis.
