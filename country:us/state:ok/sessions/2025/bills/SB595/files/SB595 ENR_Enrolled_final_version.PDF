Oklahoma jurisdiction and the county jail refuses to transfer the
inmate to the Department because of the pending charges, the
Department shall not be responsible for the housing costs of the
inmate while the inmate remains in the county jail with pending
charges. Once the inmate no longer has pending charges in the
