there is created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:
A. Sections 2 through 8 of this act shall be known and may be
cited as the “Oklahoma Math Achievement and Proficiency Act”.
B. The Legislature finds that it is essential for children
enrolled in the public schools in this state to develop strong
mathematical proficiency early and consistently. The Legislature
further finds that clear and visible goals, assessments to determine
math proficiency at each school, the use of scientifically based and
researched methodologies in math instruction, along with regular and
periodic measurements of school math improvement, and accountability
at each level of the educational system will result in a significant
increase in the number of children performing at or above grade
level in mathematics.
C. The purpose of the Oklahoma Math Achievement and Proficiency
Act is to ensure that student achievement in math is encouraged and
progression from one grade to another is determined, in part, upon
proficiency in mathematics, that school district board of education
policies facilitate promotion of advanced math instruction and
intervention services to address student math needs, and that each
student and his or her parent or legal guardian be informed of the
student’s progress in mathematics.
D. Each public school district in this state shall ensure that
all students receive a well-rounded education focused on building
deep foundations in mathematics, reading, and writing. The State
Board of Education shall encourage school districts to integrate the
teaching of the other curricular areas in subject matter standards
adopted by the Board with the instruction of mathematics, reading,
and writing.
E. All teachers of mathematics in the public schools in this
state shall incorporate into instruction the foundational elements
of math instruction, including the development of grade-level
appropriate mathematical proficiency which is a combination of real-
world problem-solving skills, procedural fluency, conceptual
understanding, and productive dispositions.

SUBJECT: Mathematics instruction
BE IT ENACTED BY THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF OKLAHOMA:
SECTION 1. NEW LAW A new section of law not to be
codified in the Oklahoma Statutes reads as follows:
Of the funds appropriated in Section 8 of Enrolled House Bill
No. 2766 of the 1st Session of the 60th Oklahoma Legislature, One
Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) shall be expended for the purpose of
implementing the Oklahoma Math Achievement and Proficiency Act.
ENR. S. B. NO. 140 Page 3

SECTION 2. NEW LAW A new section of law to be codified
in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 1210.900 of Title 70, unless
there is created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:
A. Sections 2 through 8 of this act shall be known and may be
cited as the “Oklahoma Math Achievement and Proficiency Act”.
B. The Legislature finds that it is essential for children
enrolled in the public schools in this state to develop strong
mathematical proficiency early and consistently. The Legislature
further finds that clear and visible goals, assessments to determine
math proficiency at each school, the use of scientifically based and
researched methodologies in math instruction, along with regular and
periodic measurements of school math improvement, and accountability
at each level of the educational system will result in a significant
increase in the number of children performing at or above grade
level in mathematics.
C. The purpose of the Oklahoma Math Achievement and Proficiency
Act is to ensure that student achievement in math is encouraged and
progression from one grade to another is determined, in part, upon
proficiency in mathematics, that school district board of education
policies facilitate promotion of advanced math instruction and
intervention services to address student math needs, and that each
student and his or her parent or legal guardian be informed of the
student’s progress in mathematics.
D. Each public school district in this state shall ensure that
all students receive a well-rounded education focused on building
deep foundations in mathematics, reading, and writing. The State
Board of Education shall encourage school districts to integrate the
teaching of the other curricular areas in subject matter standards
adopted by the Board with the instruction of mathematics, reading,
and writing.
E. All teachers of mathematics in the public schools in this
state shall incorporate into instruction the foundational elements
of math instruction, including the development of grade-level
appropriate mathematical proficiency which is a combination of real-
world problem-solving skills, procedural fluency, conceptual
understanding, and productive dispositions.
ENR. S. B. NO. 140 Page 4

SECTION 3. NEW LAW A new section of law to be codified
in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 1210.901 of Title 70, unless
there is created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:
A. To identify students who have a math deficiency including
students with characteristics of dyscalculia, each student enrolled
in second, third, fourth, and fifth grade in a public school in this
state shall be screened at the beginning, middle, and end of each
school year for math proficiency including, but not limited to,
real-world problem-solving skills, procedural fluency, conceptual
understanding, and productive dispositions. A screening instrument
approved by the State Board of Education shall be utilized for the
purposes of this section. In determining which screening instrument
to approve, the State Board of Education shall take into
consideration, at a minimum, the following factors:
1. The time required to conduct the screening instrument with
the intention of minimizing the impact on instructional time;
2. The timeliness in reporting screening instrument results to
teachers, administrators, and parents or legal guardians of
students; and
3. The integration of the screening instrument into the math
curriculum.
B. Beginning in the 2026-2027 school year, the State Board of
Education shall approve a list of screening instruments for use at
the beginning, middle, and end of the school year for monitoring
progress and measurement of math proficiency as required in
subsection A of this section. The screening instrument shall:
1. Assess mathematical proficiency, which is a combination of
real-world problem-solving skills, procedural fluency, conceptual
understanding, and productive dispositions for the grade level as
defined by the state’s subject matter standards;
2. Document the validity and reliability of each assessment;
3. Be used for identifying students who are at risk for math
deficiencies and for progress monitoring throughout the school year;
ENR. S. B. NO. 140 Page 5

4. Be used to assess students with disabilities and English
language learners; and
5. Be accompanied by a data management system that provides
profiles of students, class, grade level, and school building. The
profiles shall identify each student’s instructional point of need,
competency for advanced math coursework, and math proficiency level.
The State Board of Education shall also determine other comparable
math assessments for diagnostic purposes to be used for students at
risk of math failure.
C. 1. Exemptions to the screening requirements required by
this section may be provided to students who have documented
evidence that they meet at least one of the following criteria as
related to the provision of classroom instruction:
a. the student participates in the Oklahoma Alternate
Assessment Program (OAAP) and is taught using
alternate methods,
b. the student’s primary expressive or receptive
communication is sign language,
c. the student’s primary form of written or read text is
Braille, or
d. the student’s primary expressive or receptive language
is not English, the student is identified as an
English learner using a state-approved identification
assessment, and the student has had less than one (1)
school year of instruction in an English-learner
program.
2. A public school that grants an exemption pursuant to
paragraph 1 of this subsection shall provide ongoing evidence of
student progression toward English language acquisition with the
same frequency as administration of screening assessments. Evidence
may include, but not be limited to, student progression toward OAAP
math essential elements, proficiency in sign language and
mathematical reasoning, and proficiency in Braille and mathematical
concepts.
ENR. S. B. NO. 140 Page 6

D. 1. Students who are administered a screening instrument
pursuant to subsection A of this section and are found to be
exceeding grade-level targets shall be provided advanced learning
opportunities in mathematics approved for that student’s grade
level. No student who qualifies pursuant to this subsection shall
be removed from the advanced learning opportunity provided to the
student unless a parent or legal guardian of the student provides
written consent for the student to be excluded or removed after
being adequately informed that the student’s placement was
determined by the student’s achievement on the screening instrument.
2. Students who are administered a screening instrument
pursuant to subsection A of this section and are found not to be
meeting grade-level targets shall be provided a program of math
instruction designed to enable students to acquire the appropriate
grade-level math proficiency. The program of math instruction shall
be based on scientific math research and align with the subject
matter standards adopted by the State Board of Education. A program
of math instruction shall include:
a. sufficient additional in-school instructional time for
the acquisition of mathematical proficiency, which is
a combination of real-world problem-solving skills,
procedural fluency, conceptual understanding, and
productive dispositions,
b. if necessary and if funding is available, tutorial
instruction after regular school hours, on Saturdays,
