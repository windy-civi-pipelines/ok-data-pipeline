of subparagraph d of paragraph 7 of subsection A of Section 3603 of

establishment to submit such additional information as may be
12
13
necessary to administer the provisions of the Oklahoma Quality Jobs
13
14
Program Act. The approved establishment shall file quarterly claims

16
17

this title, or until it is no longer qualified to receive incentive
18
19
payments. The establishment may be audited by the Tax Commission to

verify such eligibility. Once the establishment is approved, an
20
21
agreement shall be deemed to exist between the establishment and the
21
22
State of Oklahoma, requiring the continued incentive payment to be
22
23
made as long as the establishment retains its eligibility as defined
23
24

3606 of this title and within the limitations contained in the

Oklahoma Quality Jobs Program Act, which existed at the time of such
2
3
approval. An establishment described in this subsection shall be
3
4
required to repay all incentive payments received under the Oklahoma
4
5
Quality Jobs Program Act if the establishment is determined by the
5
6
Oklahoma Tax Commission to no longer have business operations in the
6
7
state within three (3) years from the beginning of the calendar
7
8
quarter for which the first incentive payment claim is filed.

receive quarterly incentive payments pursuant to the provisions of
11
12
this section is located may file a claim with the Tax Commission for
12
13
up to twenty-five percent (25%) of the amount of such payment. The
13
14
amount of such claim shall not exceed amounts paid by the
14
15
municipality for direct costs of municipal infrastructure
15
16
improvements to provide water and sewer service to the
16
17
establishment. Such claim shall not be approved by the Tax
17
18
Commission unless the municipality and the establishment have
18
19
entered into a written agreement for such claims to be filed by the
19
20
municipality prior to submission of the application of the
20
21
establishment pursuant to the provisions of this section. If such
21
22
claim is approved, the amount of the payment to the establishment
22
23
made pursuant to the provisions of Section 3606 of this title shall
23
24
be reduced by the amount of the approved claim by the municipality
24
Req. No. 224 Page 12

and the Tax Commission shall issue a warrant to the municipality in
1
2
the amount of the approved claim in the same manner as warrants are
2
3
issued to qualifying establishments.
3
4
L. For any contract executed by an establishment on or after
4
5
August 2, 2018, five percent (5%) of the quarterly incentive payment
5
6
amount shall be transferred by the Oklahoma Tax Commission to the
