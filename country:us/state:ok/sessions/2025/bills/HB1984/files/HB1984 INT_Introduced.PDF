19 BE IT ENACTED BY THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF OKLAHOMA:
20 SECTION 1. NEW LAW A new section of law not to be
21 codified in the Oklahoma Statutes reads as follows:
22 The Legislature finds and declares the following:
23 A. Domestic abuse, stalking, dating violence, sexual assault,
24 human trafficking, and related abuse are life-threatening issues
Req. No. 11167 Page 1
1 that have lasting and harmful effects on individuals, families, and
2 communities.
3 B. Abuse survivors often lack resources, options, and
4 meaningful support when establishing independence from an abuser,
5 including the barriers of financial insecurity and limited access to
6 reliable means to maintain essential connections with family, social
7 safety networks, employers, and support services. Abuse survivors
8 may share a car title with an abusive partner, and safe access to an
9 automobile can be a lifeline for an abuse survivor.
10 C. Abusive partners increasingly use technological and
11 communication tools to exercise control over, monitor, and abuse
12 their victims. Cases of technology-enabled stalking and abuse
13 involving vehicles are increasing as automakers include app-
14 connected remote access and digital features. Through these apps,
15 abusive partners are tracking, surveilling, and intimidating abuse
16 survivors through location-tracking and remote-control functions to
17 turn on the ignition, adjust the vehicle's climate, lock doors, turn
18 off electric charging, honk the horn, record video footage and
19 audio, and use other means of electronically or remotely controlling
20 the vehicle. Tracking can be viewed in real time, or location
21 history records can be accessed and reviewed at a later time.
22 D. Tracking often occurs unbeknownst to an abuse victim, who
23 may be unaware that the vehicle is app-connected or that an abusive
24 partner has remote access through such technologies as mobile phone
Req. No. 11167 Page 2
1 wire less connectivity and location data capabilities that are
2 manufactured into vehicles.
3 E. Safeguards within vehicle design and remote access can
4 prevent future abuse, including requiring app-connected and tracking
5 notifications to be designed to provide knowledge of who has
6 vehicular access.
7 F. According to privacy researchers and as reported in the New
8 York Times, modern vehicles have been called smartphones with wheels
9 because they are Internet-connected and have myriad methods of data
10 collection, from cameras and seat weight sensors to records of how
11 hard you brake and corner. Most drivers do not realize how much
12 information their cars are collecting and who has access to it.
13 G. Under the federal Safe Connections Act of 2022, survivors of
14 domestic abuse are empowered to protect themselves and their loved
15 ones by requiring telecommunications providers, upon request, to
16 separate their mobile phone accounts from the accounts of their
17 abusers, but the law does not extend to vehicular technology.
18 H. It is the intent of this act to end stalking and abuse by
19 abusive partners who can access connected vehicle service.
20 SECTION 2. NEW LAW A new section of law to be codified
21 in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 1901 of Title 47, unless there

6 vehicle service that allows a person who is outside of a vehicle,
7 excluding a covered provider or vehicle cellular data provider, to
8 view or track the location of the vehicle, including, but not
9 limited to, a location determined by a Global Positioning System
10 (GPS), whether through the Internet, an app-based technology, or any
11 other remote wireless connectivity technology;
12 3. "Connected vehicle service" means any capability provided by
13 or on behalf of a vehicle manufacturer that enables a person,
14 excluding a covered provider or vehicle cellular data provider, to
15 remotely obtain data from, or send commands to, a vehicle, which may
16 be accomplished through a software application that is designed to
17 be operated on a mobile device;

19 other means by which a person enrolls in or obtains access to a
