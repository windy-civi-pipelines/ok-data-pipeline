13 SECTION 1. AMENDATORY 70 O.S. 2021, Section 6-127A, is
14 amended to read as follows:
15 Section 6-127A. A. The Oklahoma Legislature recognizes that
16 public school paraprofessionals play an important role in educating
17 school children and in assisting teachers. The Legislature further
18 recognizes the increasing role of public school paraprofessionals in
19 the school system in light of teacher shortages. To achieve the
20 goal of excellence for all persons who have an impact on student
21 learning, it is the intent of the Oklahoma Legislature that public
22 school paraprofessionals be afforded career opportunities and
23 economic incentives through a career development program.

1 B. The State Board of Education shall adopt a program for the
2 career development of public school paraprofessionals. The purpose
3 of the program is to provide to public school paraprofessionals a
4 system of career development which is based upon education and
5 training advancement to encourage excellence among public school
6 paraprofessionals. Public school paraprofessionals who hold a
7 bachelor's degree in education or education studies and who have not
8 been out of the classroom for more than ten (10) years shall be
9 deemed to have satisfied any rule that requires additional
10 professional education coursework from an institution of higher
11 education under the adopted program. Nothing in this section shall
12 be construed to require public school paraprofessionals to
13 participate in the career development program.
14 C. The board of education of a school district shall have
15 authority to extend an existing contract with a public school
16 paraprofessional that provides for the payment of compensation for
17 paraprofessional services rendered for the same time period during
18 which the paraprofessional is also assigned to the school district
19 for practice teaching as a student teacher.
20 D. For the purposes of this section, a public school
21 paraprofessional is an employee of a school district whose position
22 is either instructional in nature, or who delivers other direct
23 services to students and/or their parents. A public school
24 paraprofessional serves in a position for which a teacher or another

6 is created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:

8 studies shall be deemed to have satisfied any State Board of
9 Education rule that requires teachers to complete additional
10 professional education coursework from an institution of higher
11 education as a condition to obtain, renew, or satisfy any other
12 professional development requirement for an emergency certificate,
13 alternate placement teaching certificate, or standard certificate if
14 the teacher has not been out of the classroom for more than ten (10)
15 years.
16 SECTION 3. This act shall become effective July 1, 2025.
