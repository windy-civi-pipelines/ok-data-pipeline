1 goal of excellence for all persons who have an impact on student
2 learning, it is the intent of the Oklahoma Legislature that public
3 school paraprofessionals be afforded career opportunities and
4 economic incentives through a career development program.
5 B. The State Board of Education shall adopt a program for the
6 career development of public school paraprofessionals. The purpose
7 of the program is to provide to public school paraprofessionals a
8 system of career development which is based upon education and
9 training advancement to encourage excellence among public school
10 paraprofessionals. Public school paraprofessionals who hold a
11 bachelor's degree in education or education studies and who have not
12 been out of the classroom for more than ten (10) years shall be
13 deemed to have satisfied any rule that requires additional
14 professional education coursework from an institution of higher
15 education under the adopted program. Nothing in this section shall
16 be construed to require public school paraprofessionals to
17 participate in the career development program.
18 C. The board of education of a school district shall have
19 authority to extend an existing contract with a public school
20 paraprofessional that provides for the payment of compensation for
21 paraprofessional services rendered for the same time period during
22 which the paraprofessional is also assigned to the school district
23 for practice teaching as a student teacher.

5 paraprofessional serves in a position for which a teacher or another
6 professional has the ultimate responsibility for the design,
7 implementation, and evaluation of the individual educational
8 programs or related services and student performance.
9 SECTION 2. NEW LAW A new section of law to be codified
10 in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 6-213 of Title 70, unless there

13 studies shall be deemed to have satisfied any State Board of
14 Education rule that requires teachers to complete additional
15 professional education coursework from an institution of higher
16 education as a condition to obtain, renew, or satisfy any other
17 professional development requirement for an emergency certificate,
18 alternate placement teaching certificate, or standard certificate if
19 the teacher has not been out of the classroom for more than ten (10)
20 years.
21 SECTION 3. This act shall become effective July 1, 2025.
