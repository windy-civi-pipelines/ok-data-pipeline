19 SECTION 1. AMENDATORY 70 O.S. 2021, Section 6-127A, is
20 amended to read as follows:
21 Section 6-127A. A. The Oklahoma Legislature recognizes that
22 public school paraprofessionals play an important role in educating
23 school children and in assisting teachers. The Legislature further
24 recognizes the increasing role of public school paraprofessionals in
Req. No. 13109 Page 1
1 the school system in light of teacher shortages. To achieve the
2 goal of excellence for all persons who have an impact on student
3 learning, it is the intent of the Oklahoma Legislature that public
4 school paraprofessionals be afforded career opportunities and
5 economic incentives through a career development program.
6 B. The State Board of Education shall adopt a program for the
7 career development of public school paraprofessionals. The purpose
8 of the program is to provide to public school paraprofessionals a
9 system of career development which is based upon education and
10 training advancement to encourage excellence among public school
11 paraprofessionals. Public school paraprofessionals who hold a
12 bachelor's degree in education or education studies and who have not
13 been out of the classroom for more than ten (10) years shall be
14 deemed to have satisfied any rule that requires additional
15 professional education coursework from an institution of higher
16 education under the adopted program. Nothing in this section shall
17 be construed to require public school paraprofessionals to
18 participate in the career development program.
19 C. The board of education of a school district shall have
20 authority to extend an existing contract with a public school
21 paraprofessional that provides for the payment of compensation for
22 paraprofessional services rendered for the same time period during
23 which the paraprofessional is also assigned to the school district
24 for practice teaching as a student teacher.
Req. No. 13109 Page 2
1 D. For the purposes of this section, a public school
2 paraprofessional is an employee of a school district whose position
3 is either instructional in nature, or who delivers other direct
4 services to students and/or their parents. A public school
5 paraprofessional serves in a position for which a teacher or another
6 professional has the ultimate responsibility for the design,
7 implementation, and evaluation of the individual educational
8 programs or related services and student performance.
9 SECTION 2. NEW LAW A new section of law to be codified
10 in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 6-213 of Title 70, unless there
11 is created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:
12 Teachers who hold a bachelor's degree in education or education
13 studies shall be deemed to have satisfied any State Board of
14 Education rule that requires teachers to complete additional
15 professional education coursework from an institution of higher
16 education as a condition to obtain, renew, or satisfy any other
17 professional development requirement for an emergency certificate,
18 alternate placement teaching certificate, or standard certificate if
19 the teacher has not been out of the classroom for more than ten (10)
20 years.
21 SECTION 3. This act shall become effective July 1, 2025.

23 of the public peace, health or safety, an emergency is hereby
