15 SECTION 1. AMENDATORY 70 O.S. 2021, Section 6-127A, is
16 amended to read as follows:
17 Section 6-127A. A. The Oklahoma Legislature recognizes that
18 public school paraprofessionals play an important role in educating
19 school children and in assisting teachers. The Legislature further
20 recognizes the increasing role of public school paraprofessionals in
21 the school system in light of teacher shortages. To achieve the
22 goal of excellence for all persons who have an impact on student
23 learning, it is the intent of the Oklahoma Legislature that public
24

1 scho ol paraprofessionals be afforded career opportunities and
2 economic incentives through a career development program.
3 B. The State Board of Education shall adopt a program for the
4 career development of public school paraprofessionals. The purpose
5 of the program is to provide to public school paraprofessionals a
6 system of career development which is based upon education and
7 training advancement to encourage excellence among public school
8 paraprofessionals. Public school paraprofessionals who hold a
9 bachelor's degree in education or education studies and who have not
10 been out of the classroom for more than ten (10) years shall be
11 deemed to have satisfied any rule that requires additional
12 professional education coursework from an institution of higher
13 education under the adopted program. Nothing in this section shall
14 be construed to require public school paraprofessionals to
15 participate in the career development program.
16 C. The board of education of a school district shall have
17 authority to extend an existing contract with a public school
18 paraprofessional that provides for the payment of compensation for
19 paraprofessional services rendered for the same time period during
20 which the paraprofessional is also assigned to the school district
21 for practice teaching as a student teacher.
22 D. For the purposes of this section, a public school
23 paraprofessional is an employee of a school district whose position
24 is either instructional in nature, or who delivers other direct

1 serv ices to students and/or their parents. A public school
2 paraprofessional serves in a position for which a teacher or another
3 professional has the ultimate responsibility for the design,
4 implementation, and evaluation of the individual educational
5 programs or related services and student performance.
6 SECTION 2. NEW LAW A new section of law to be codified
7 in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 6-213 of Title 70, unless there
8 is created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:
9 Teachers who hold a bachelor's degree in education or education
10 studies shall be deemed to have satisfied any State Board of
11 Education rule that requires teachers to complete additional
12 professional education coursework from an institution of higher
13 education as a condition to obtain, renew, or satisfy any other
14 professional development requirement for an emergency certificate,
15 alternate placement teaching certificate, or standard certificate if
16 the teacher has not been out of the classroom for more than ten (10)
17 years.
18 SECTION 3. This act shall become effective July 1, 2025.
19 SECTION 4. It being immediately necessary for the preservation
20 of the public peace, health or safety, an emergency is hereby
21 declared to exist, by reason whereof this act shall take effect and
22 be in full force from and after its passage and approval.
