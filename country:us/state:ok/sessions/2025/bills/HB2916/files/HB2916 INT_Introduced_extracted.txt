22 BE IT ENACTED BY THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF OKLAHOMA:
23 SECTION 1. NEW LAW A new section of law not to be
24 codified in the Oklahoma Statutes reads as follows:
Req. No. 11308 Page 1
1 A. The Problem.
2 Research shows that unaddressed trauma can undermine children's
3 ability to learn, form relationships, and function appropriately in
4 the classroom. In the past, calling the Oklahoma Department of
5 Human Services statewide centralized hotline to make a mandated
6 child welfare report was one of the only tools in the first
7 responder's toolbox, but most children and teens do not meet the
8 criteria for a child welfare report. Consequently, many children
9 and teens are never identified, nor do they receive needed services,
10 and they linger in traumatic situations without adequate support.
11 These students have an increased risk for negative outcomes such as
12 poor academic performance, truancy, dropping out of school, and
13 delinquency.
14 B. The Handle With Care Oklahoma Program Purpose.
15 Handle With Care (HWC) Oklahoma is a program designed to enhance
16 existing cross-agency communication and partnership between local
17 law enforcement, community mental health services and supports, and
18 schools regarding children's exposure to traumatic events. The
19 "Handle With Care" approach enables first responders to start
20 building trust and positive connections with children and teens they
21 encounter at a traumatic scene and through an HWC notification,
22 local schools and mental health providers can provide trauma-
23 sensitive support immediately as needed. HWC Oklahoma is aimed at
24 ensuring that children who are exposed to crime, violence, and abuse
Req. No. 11308 Page 2
1 rece ive appropriate interventions so they can succeed in school to
2 the best of their ability. Children must feel safe in order to
3 learn.
4 SECTION 2. NEW LAW A new section of law to be codified
5 in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 1210.164 of Title 70, unless
6 there is created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:
7 A. Subject to the availability of funding pursuant to
8 subsection K of this section, the Oklahoma State Department of
9 Education shall implement and operate a Handle With Care (HWC)
10 Oklahoma program. HWC Oklahoma program efforts shall enhance
11 existing partnerships and collaborations with key partners such as,
12 but not limited to, state and local first responder agencies, school
13 districts, community coalitions, the State Department of Education,
14 the Department of Human Services, and the State Department of
15 Health. The HWC Oklahoma program shall enhance planning, training,
16 implementation, and sustainability in all counties in the state.
17 The program shall provide opportunities for local HWC programs to
18 receive support from the state as needed.
19 B. The HWC Oklahoma program shall enable a law enforcement
20 officer or employee of a law enforcement agency to notify the
21 program when a child, who may attend a public school or childcare

23 scene with a first responder, or another event occurs that may
