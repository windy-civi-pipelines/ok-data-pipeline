with the schedule outlined below. Leave shall be accrued based upon

mean the Teachers’ Retirement System of Oklahoma. The “receiving
4

system” shall mean the Oklahoma Public Employees Retirement System.
5
6
a. Within thirty (30) days after notification of an
6
7
intent to transfer is received by the sending system,
7
8
the sending system shall, according to its own rules
8
9
and regulations:
9
10
(1) for members who have vested with the sending
10
11
system, determine the present value of the
11
12
member’s earned benefits attributable to the
12
13
years of service sought to be transferred,
13
14
discounted according to the member’s age at the
14
15
time of transfer and computed as of the earliest
15
16
age at which the member would be able to retire.
16
17
Such computation shall assume an unreduced
17
18
benefit and be computed using interest and
18
19
mortality assumptions consistent with the
19
20
actuarial assumptions adopted by the Board of
20
21
Trustees for purposes of preparing the annual
21
22
actuarial evaluation but shall not make any
22
23
projections regarding future salary. For vested
23
24
employees the sending system shall use the
24
Req. No. 515 Page 20
1
product of this calculation for purposes of
1
2
determining the transfer fee to be paid by the
2
3
employee under subparagraph c of this paragraph
3
4
so long as it is greater than the product of the
4

calculation in this division, and
5
6
(2) determine the sum of the employee and employer
6

contributions applicable to the years of service
7
8
sought to be transferred plus interest consistent
8
9
with the actuarial assumptions adopted by the
9
10
Board of Trustees for purposes of preparing the

11
annual actuarial evaluation. For all nonvested
11

members, and for vested members if the product of
12
13
this calculation is greater than the product of
13
14
the calculation in division (1) of this
14
15
subparagraph, the sending system shall use the
15
16
product of this calculation for purposes of
16
17
determining the amount to be transferred by the
17
18
sending system under subparagraph c of this
18
19
paragraph and any transfer fee to be paid by the
19
20
members under subparagraph d of this paragraph.
20
21
b. Within thirty (30) days after notification of an

23
system, the receiving system shall determine,
23
24
according to the system’s own rules and regulations,
24
Req. No. 515 Page 21
1
the present value of the member’s incremental
1
2
projected benefits discounted according to the
2
3
member’s age at the time of the transfer. Incremental
3
4
projected benefits shall be the difference between the
4
5
projected benefit the member would receive without
5
6
transferring the service credit and the projected
6
7
benefit after transfer of service credit computed as
7
8
of the earliest age at which the member would be able
8
9
to retire. Such computation shall assume an unreduced
9
10
benefit and be computed using interest, salary
10
11
projections and mortality assumptions consistent with
11
12
the actuarial assumptions adopted by the Board of
12
13
Trustees for purposes of preparing the annual
13
14
actuarial evaluation.
14
15
c. The sending system shall, within sixty (60) days from
15

the date notification of an intent to transfer is
16
17
received by the sending system, transfer to the
17
18
receiving system the amount determined in subparagraph
18
19
a of this paragraph. Except, if the cost under
19
20
subparagraph a of this paragraph for the same years of
20
21
service to the sending system is greater than the
21
22
actuarial value of the incremental benefit in the
22
23
receiving system, as established in subparagraph b of
23
24
this paragraph, the sending system shall send the
24
Req. No. 515 Page 22
1
receiving system an amount equal to the actuarial
1
2
value of the incremental projected benefit in the
2
3
receiving system.

d. In order to receive the credit provided for in
4
5
paragraph 1 of this subsection, if the cost of the
5
6
actuarial value of the incremental benefit to the
6
7
receiving system is greater than the cost as
7
8
calculated under subparagraph a of this paragraph for
8
9
the same years of service to the sending system as
9
10
established in subparagraphs a and b of this
10

paragraph, the employee shall elect to:

16
System of Oklahoma pursuant to this subsection.
16
17
Such an election shall be made in writing, filed with

year. Any member who ceases to make payment, terminates, retires or
11
12
dies before completing the payments provided for in this section
12
13
shall receive prorated service credit for only those payments made,
13
14
unless the unpaid balance is paid by the member, his or her estate
14
15
or successor in interest within six (6) months after the member’s
15
16
death, termination of employment or retirement; provided, no
16
17
retirement benefits shall be payable until the unpaid balance is
17
18
paid, unless said the member or beneficiary affirmatively waives the

additional six-month period in which to pay the unpaid balance.

Section 39:
4. Years of service transferred pursuant to this subsection
20
21

last amended by Section 172, Chapter 452, O.S.L. 2024 (74 O.S. Supp.

and Enterprise Services shall promulgate such emergency and

permanent rules regarding leave and holiday leave as are necessary

The Director of the Office of Management and Enterprise
3
4
Services, in adopting new rules, amending rules and repealing rules,
4

shall ensure that the following provisions are incorporated:
5
6
1. Eligible employees who enter on duty or who are reinstated
6
7
after a break in service shall receive leave benefits in accordance
7
8
with the schedule outlined below. Leave shall be accrued based upon
8
9
hours worked, paid leave, and holidays, but excluding overtime, not
9
10
to exceed the total possible work hours for the pay period. Years
10
11
of service shall be based on cumulative periods of employment
11
12
calculated in the manner that cumulative service is determined for
12
13
longevity purposes pursuant to Section 840-2.18 of this title.
13
14
Employees may accumulate more than the maximum annual leave
14
15
accumulation limits shown in the schedule below provided that such

excess is used during the same calendar year in which it accrues or
16
17
within twelve (12) months of the date on which it accrues, at the
17
18
discretion of the appointing authority. If an employee whose job
18
19
duties include providing fire protection services, law enforcement
19
20
services or services with the Department of Corrections is unable to
20
21
use excess leave as provided for in this paragraph because the
21
22
employee’s request for leave is denied by the employee’s appointing
22
23
authority and the denial of leave is due to extraordinary
23
24
circumstances such that taking leave could pose a threat to public
24
Req. No. 515 Page 2

required to have been used;

More than $1,000 up to $1,500 = 3 years participating service
13
14
More than $1,500 up to $2,000 = 4 years participating service

More than $2,000 = 5 years participating service
15
16
In no event shall the employee be entitled to more than five (5)
16
17
additional years of participating service as provided hereunder.
17
18
Provided further, that upon termination of employment prior to
18
19

unused sick leave shall equal one (1) month for
5
6
purposes of participating service credit. If unused
6
7
sick leave entitles a member to an additional year of
7
8
service credit, the member’s employer shall reimburse
8
9
the System for the cost of funding the additional
9
10
benefit. For members who join the System on or after
10
11
November 1, 2012, if unused sick leave entitles a
11
12
member to any additional service credit, the member’s
12
13
employer shall reimburse the System for the cost of
13
14
funding the additional benefit. Each participating

21
22
subparagraph a of this paragraph shall be credited at

23
the same rate but not used to round up to another
23
24
year. Instead, any additional months of unused sick
24
Req. No. 515 Page 16

without rounding.
2
3
c. Members who accrue unused sick leave may, pursuant to
3
4
Section 840-2.20 of this title, elect to transfer such
4
5
leave for the purpose of converting the unused leave
5
6
to the member’s retirement insurance benefit allowance
6
7
in lieu of purchasing service credit under this
7
8
subparagraph.
8
9
C. In determining the number of years of credited service, a
9
10
fractional year of six (6) months or more shall be considered as one
10
11
(1) year, and less than six (6) months shall be disregarded. For
11
12
members who join the System on or after November 1, 2012, the number

Members electing to take advantage of the transfer authorized by

2. For purposes of this subsection, the “sending system” shall
3
4
mean the Teachers’ Retirement System of Oklahoma. The “receiving
4
5
system” shall mean the Oklahoma Public Employees Retirement System.
5
6
a. Within thirty (30) days after notification of an
6
7
intent to transfer is received by the sending system,
7
8
the sending system shall, according to its own rules
8
9
and regulations:
9
10
(1) for members who have vested with the sending
10
11
system, determine the present value of the
11
12
member’s earned benefits attributable to the
12
13
years of service sought to be transferred,
13
14
discounted according to the member’s age at the
14
15
time of transfer and computed as of the earliest
15
16
age at which the member would be able to retire.
16
17
Such computation shall assume an unreduced
17
18
benefit and be computed using interest and
18
19
mortality assumptions consistent with the
19
20
actuarial assumptions adopted by the Board of
20
21
Trustees for purposes of preparing the annual
21
22
actuarial evaluation but shall not make any
22
23
projections regarding future salary. For vested
23
24
employees the sending system shall use the
24
Req. No. 515 Page 20

1
product of this calculation for purposes of
1
2
determining the transfer fee to be paid by the
2
3
employee under subparagraph c of this paragraph
3
4
so long as it is greater than the product of the
4
5
calculation in this division, and
5
6
(2) determine the sum of the employee and employer
6
7
contributions applicable to the years of service
7
8
sought to be transferred plus interest consistent
8
9
with the actuarial assumptions adopted by the
9
10
Board of Trustees for purposes of preparing the
10
11
annual actuarial evaluation. For all nonvested
11
12
members, and for vested members if the product of
12
13
this calculation is greater than the product of
13
14
the calculation in division (1) of this
14
15
subparagraph, the sending system shall use the
15
16
product of this calculation for purposes of
16
17
determining the amount to be transferred by the
17
18
sending system under subparagraph c of this
18
19
paragraph and any transfer fee to be paid by the
19
20
members under subparagraph d of this paragraph.
20
21
b. Within thirty (30) days after notification of an
21
22
intent to transfer is received by the receiving
22
23
system, the receiving system shall determine,
23
24
according to the system’s own rules and regulations,
24
Req. No. 515 Page 21

1
the present value of the member’s incremental
1
2
projected benefits discounted according to the
2
3
member’s age at the time of the transfer. Incremental
3
4
projected benefits shall be the difference between the
4
5
projected benefit the member would receive without
5
6
transferring the service credit and the projected
6
7
benefit after transfer of service credit computed as
7
8
of the earliest age at which the member would be able
8
9
to retire. Such computation shall assume an unreduced
9
10
benefit and be computed using interest, salary
10
11
projections and mortality assumptions consistent with
11
12
the actuarial assumptions adopted by the Board of
12
13
Trustees for purposes of preparing the annual
13
14
actuarial evaluation.
14
15
c. The sending system shall, within sixty (60) days from
15
16
the date notification of an intent to transfer is
16
17
received by the sending system, transfer to the
17
18
receiving system the amount determined in subparagraph
18
19
a of this paragraph. Except, if the cost under
19
20
subparagraph a of this paragraph for the same years of
20
21
service to the sending system is greater than the
21
22
actuarial value of the incremental benefit in the
22
23
receiving system, as established in subparagraph b of
23
24
this paragraph, the sending system shall send the
24
Req. No. 515 Page 22

1
receiving system an amount equal to the actuarial
1
2
value of the incremental projected benefit in the
2
3
receiving system.
3
4
d. In order to receive the credit provided for in
4
5
paragraph 1 of this subsection, if the cost of the
5
6
actuarial value of the incremental benefit to the
6
7
receiving system is greater than the cost as
7
8
calculated under subparagraph a of this paragraph for
8
9
the same years of service to the sending system as
9
10
established in subparagraphs a and b of this
10
11
paragraph, the employee shall elect to:
11
12
(1) pay any difference to receive full credit for the
12
13
years sought to be transferred, or
13
14
(2) receive prorated service credit for only the
14
15
amount received from the Teachers’ Retirement
15
16
System of Oklahoma pursuant to this subsection.
16
17
Such an election shall be made in writing, filed with
17
18
the System prior to receiving the credit provided for
18
19
in paragraph 1 of this subsection, and shall be
19
20
irrevocable.
20
21
3. Within sixty (60) days of successfully completing all of the
21

requirements for transfer under this subsection, the sending system
22
23
shall pay the receiving system any amount due under this subsection.
23

Within sixty (60) days of successfully completing all of the
24
Req. No. 515 Page 23

4
5
receiving system shall permit the member to amortize the transfer
5
6
fee over a period not to exceed sixty (60) months. The payments
6
7
shall be made by payroll deductions unless the Board of Trustees
7
8
permits an alternate payment source. The amortization shall include
8
9
interest in an amount not to exceed the actuarially assumed interest
9
10
rate adopted by the Board of Trustees for investment earnings each
10
11
year. Any member who ceases to make payment, terminates, retires or
11
12
dies before completing the payments provided for in this section
12
13
shall receive prorated service credit for only those payments made,
13
14
unless the unpaid balance is paid by the member, his or her estate
14
15
or successor in interest within six (6) months after the member’s
15
16
death, termination of employment or retirement; provided, no
16
17
retirement benefits shall be payable until the unpaid balance is
17
18
paid, unless said the member or beneficiary affirmatively waives the
18
19
additional six-month period in which to pay the unpaid balance.
19
20
4. Years of service transferred pursuant to this subsection
20
21
shall be used both in determining the member’s retirement benefit
21
22
and in determining the years of service for retirement and/or and
22
23
vesting purposes. Years of service rendered as a member of the
23
24
Teachers’ Retirement System of Oklahoma prior to July 1, 1992, if

1992, and shall qualify such person as a member of the Oklahoma
3
4
Public Employees Retirement System before July 1, 1992.

70 of the Oklahoma Statutes, members electing to take advantage of
6
7
the transfer authorized by this subsection who have withdrawn their

10
withdrawn plus simple interest of ten percent (10%) per annum prior

11
12
the transfer shall be canceled. If such an election is deemed
12
13
invalid and the transfer is canceled, the accumulated contribution
13
14
remitted to the sending system by the member who originally withdrew
14
15
their contributions shall be returned to the member. The member’s
15
16
rights and obligations regarding any service credit reestablished in
16
17
the sending system due to a failure to satisfy the requirements of

18
this subsection shall be determined by the sending system in
18
19
accordance with Section 17-101 et seq. of Title 70 of the Oklahoma
19
20

22
requirements of this subsection, the election to transfer retirement
22
23
credit shall be void and of no effect, and any retirement credited
23
24

Req. No. 515 Page 25

1
credit is canceled, the years of canceled retirement credit which
