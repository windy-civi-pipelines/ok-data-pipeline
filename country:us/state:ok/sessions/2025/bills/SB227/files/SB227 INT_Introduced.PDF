aggregate number of years for which credit may be allowed.
11
12
F. The credit provided for in subsection A or B of this

14
equivalent employees, shall be allowed in each of the four (4)
14
15
subsequent years only if the level of new employees is maintained in
15
16
the subsequent year. In calculating the credit by the number of new
16
17
employees, only those employees whose paid wages or salary were at
17
18
least Seven Thousand Dollars ($7,000.00) during each year the credit
18
19
is claimed shall be included in the calculation. Provided, that the

20
first year a credit is claimed for a new employee, such employee may
20
21
be included in the calculation notwithstanding paid wages of less
21
22
than Seven Thousand Dollars ($7,000.00) if the employee was hired in
22
23
the last three quarters of the tax year, has wages or salary which

5
determined by comparing the monthly average number of full-time
5
6
employees subject to Oklahoma income tax withholding for the final
6
7
quarter of the taxable year with the corresponding period of the

14
15
credit shall be allowed in any taxable year for a net increase in
15
16
the number of full-time-equivalent employees if such increase is a
16
17
result of an investment in qualified depreciable property for which

18
an income tax credit has been allowed as authorized by this section.

17
apportioned with property and payroll, each comprising twenty-five
17
18
percent (25%) of the apportionment factor and sales comprising fifty
18
19
percent (50%) of the apportionment factor. The apportionment
19
20
factors shall be computed as follows:
20
21
a. The property factor is a fraction, the numerator of
21
22
which is the average value of the taxpayer’s real and
22
23
tangible personal property owned or rented and used in
23
24
this state during the tax period and the denominator
24
Req. No. 974 Page 36

of which is the average value of all the taxpayer’s
1
2
real and tangible personal property everywhere owned
2
3
or rented and used during the tax period.
3
4
(1) Property, the income from which is separately
4
5
allocated in paragraph 4 of this subsection,
5
6
shall not be included in determining this
6
7
fraction. The numerator of the fraction shall

transportation and other equipment having no
9
10
fixed situs, such as rolling stock, buses, trucks
10
11
and trailers, including machinery and equipment
11
12
carried thereon, airplanes, salespersons’
12
13
automobiles and other similar equipment, in the
13
14
proportion that miles traveled in Oklahoma this
14
15
state by such equipment bears to total miles
15
16
traveled,
16
17
(2) Property owned by the taxpayer is valued at its
17
18
original cost. Property rented by the taxpayer
18
19
is valued at eight times the net annual rental
19
20
rate. Net annual rental rate is the annual
20
21
rental rate paid by the taxpayer, less any annual
21
22
rental rate received by the taxpayer from
22
23
subrentals,
23
24
24
Req. No. 974 Page 37

(3) The average value of property shall be determined
1
2
by averaging the values at the beginning and
2
3
ending of the tax period but the Oklahoma Tax
3
4
Commission may require the averaging of monthly
4
5
values during the tax period if reasonably
5
6
required to reflect properly the average value of
6
7
the taxpayer’s property;
7
8
b. The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of
8
9
which is the total compensation for services rendered
9
10
in the state during the tax period, and the
10
11
denominator of which is the total compensation for
11
12
services rendered everywhere during the tax period.
12
13
“Compensation”, as used in this subsection, means
13
14
those paid-for services to the extent related to the
14
15
unitary business but does not include officers’
15
16
salaries, wages and other compensation.
16
17
(1) In the case of a transportation enterprise, the
17
18
numerator of the fraction shall include a portion
18
19
of such expenditure in connection with employees
19
20
operating equipment over a fixed route, such as
20
21
railroad employees, airline pilots, or bus
21
22
drivers, in this state only a part of the time,
22
23
in the proportion that mileage traveled in
23
24
24
Req. No. 974 Page 38

Oklahoma this state bears to total mileage
1
2
traveled by such employees,
2
3
(2) In any case the numerator of the fraction shall
3
4
include a portion of such expenditures in
4
5
connection with itinerant employees, such as
5
6
traveling salespersons, in this state only a part
6
7
of the time, in the proportion that time spent in
7
8
Oklahoma this state bears to total time spent in
8
9
furtherance of the enterprise by such employees;
9
10
c. The sales factor is a fraction, the numerator of which
10
11
is the total sales or gross revenue of the taxpayer in
11
12
this state during the tax period, and the denominator
12
13
of which is the total sales or gross revenue of the
13
14
taxpayer everywhere during the tax period. “Sales”,
14
15
as used in this subsection, does not include sales or
15
16
gross revenue which are separately allocated in
16
17
paragraph 4 of this subsection.
17
18
(1) Sales of tangible personal property have a situs
18
19
in this state if the property is delivered or
19
20
shipped to a purchaser other than the United
20
21
States government, within this state regardless
21
22
of the FOB Freight on Board (FOB) point or other
22
23
conditions of the sale; or the property is

3
4
state of the destination of the shipment.

5
(2) In the case of a railroad or interurban railway
5
6
enterprise, the numerator of the fraction shall
6
7
not be less than the allocation of revenues to
7
8
this state as shown in its annual report to the
8
9
Corporation Commission.
9
10
(3) In the case of an airline, truck or bus
10
11
enterprise or freight car, tank car, refrigerator
11

car or other railroad equipment enterprise, the
12
13
numerator of the fraction shall include a portion
13
14
of revenue from interstate transportation in the
14
15
proportion that interstate mileage traveled in
15
16
Oklahoma this state bears to total interstate
16
17
mileage traveled.
17
18
(4) In the case of an oil, gasoline or gas pipeline
18
19
enterprise, the numerator of the fraction shall
19
20
be either the total of traffic units of the
20
21
enterprise within Oklahoma this state or the
21
22
revenue allocated to Oklahoma this state based
22
23
upon miles moved, at the option of the taxpayer,
23
24
and the denominator of which shall be the total
24
Req. No. 974 Page 40

1
of traffic units of the enterprise or the revenue
1
2
of the enterprise everywhere as appropriate to
2
3
the numerator. A “traffic unit” is hereby
3
4
defined as the transportation for a distance of
4
5
one (1) mile of one (1) barrel of oil, one (1)
5
6
gallon of gasoline or one thousand (1,000) cubic
6
7
feet of natural or casinghead gas, as the case
7

(5) In the case of a telephone or telegraph or other
9
10
communication enterprise, the numerator of the
10
11
fraction shall include that portion of the

15
in respect to each corporation or business entity

required by the Federal Communications Commission
16
17
to keep its books and records in accordance with
17
18
a uniform system of accounts prescribed by such
18
19
Commission, the intrastate net income shall be
19
20
determined separately in the manner provided by
20
21
such uniform system of accounts and only the

22
interstate income shall be subject to allocation

prescribed in this paragraph attributes to Oklahoma this state a
5
6
portion of net income of the enterprise out of all appropriate
6
7
proportion to the property owned and/or business transacted within
7
8
this state, because of the fact that one or more of the factors so
8
9
prescribed are not employed to any appreciable extent in furtherance
9
10
of the enterprise; or because one or more factors not so prescribed
10
11
are employed to a considerable extent in furtherance of the
11
12
enterprise; or because of other reasons, the Tax Commission is
12
