20 contrary of the System, the System, which as a governmental plan
21 (within the meaning of Section 414(d) of the Internal Revenue Code
22 of 1986, as amended), is treated as having complied with Section

5 1980, because of the transfer of the employing agency from the
6 Oklahoma Public Employees Retirement System to the System, and was
7 not a member of the Oklahoma Public Employees Retirement System on
8 the date of such transfer shall be allowed to receive credit for
9 prior law enforcement service rendered to this state, if the member
10 is not receiving or eligible to receive retirement credit or
11 benefits for such service in any other public retirement system,
12 upon payment to the System of the employee contribution the member
13 would have been subject to had the member been a member of the
14 System at the time, plus five percent (5%) interest. Service credit

4 1992, gross salary shall include any amount of elective salary
5 reduction under Section 125 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as

8 income of the member under Section 132(f)(4) of the Internal Revenue
9 Code of 1986, as amended. Effective July 1, 1998, for purposes of
10 determining a member's compensation, any contribution by the member
11 to reduce his or her regular cash remuneration under Section
12 132(f)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, shall be
13 treated as if the member did not make such an election. Only salary
14 on which required contributions have been made may be used in

4 determined ("determination period") beginning in such calendar year.
5 If a determination period consists of fewer than twelve (12) months,
6 the EGTRRA salary limit will be multiplied by a fraction, the
7 numerator of which is the number of months in the determination
8 period, and the denominator of which is twelve (12). For purposes
9 of this section, a "Noneligible Member" is any member who first
10 became a member during a plan year commencing on or after July 1,
11 1996.
12 For plan years beginning on or after July 1, 2002, any reference
13 in the System to the annual salary limit under Section 401(a)(17) of

17 also include gross salary, as described above, for services, but
18 paid by the later of two and one-half (2 1/2) months after a

11 individual had continued to perform services for the employer rather
12 than entering qualified military service.
13 Effective January 1, 2008, back pay, within the meaning of
14 Section 1.415(c)-2(g)(8) of the Income Tax Regulations, shall be
15 treated as gross salary for the limitation year to which the back
16 pay relates to the extent the back pay represents wages and
