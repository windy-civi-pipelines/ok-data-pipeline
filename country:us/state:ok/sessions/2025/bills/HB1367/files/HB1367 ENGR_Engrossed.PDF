9 ten (10) days after receipt of an administrative notice of
10 violation, an affidavit indicating that the licensed establishment

2 licensed establishment has indirectly encouraged a violation of the
3 law pursuant to this act. The rebuttable presumption is created
4 regardless of whether the employee performing the action described
5 in this subsection on a second or subsequent occasion is the same
6 employee who performed the initial action. Proof of violation shall
7 be demonstrated by:
8 1. Producing final orders issued by the ABLE Commission or a
9 court of competent jurisdiction finding that the licensed
10 establishment violated this act on two past occasions; and

15 offense and shall have occurred within a twelve-month period, as
16 calculated from the dates the incidents occurred.
17 H. At a hearing in which the licensed establishment asserts the
18 affirmative defense established in this act, the ABLE Commission may
19 present evidence to establish a rebuttable presumption under this
20 act. If the evidence is sufficient to establish a prima facie case,
21 the burden of persuasion in the proceeding shifts to the licensed
22 establishment to show that it has not indirectly encouraged a
23 violation of the law within the meaning of this act.
