1 B. As a basis for determining the Nursing Facilities Quality of
2 Care Fee assessed upon each licensed nursing facility, the Authority
3 shall calculate a uniform per-patient day rate. The rate shall be
4 calculated by dividing six percent (6%) of the total annual patient
5 gross receipts of all licensed nursing facilities in this state by
6 the total number of patient days for all licensed nursing facilities
7 in this state. The result shall be the per-patient day rate.
8 Beginning July 15, 2004, the Nursing Facilities Quality of Care Fee
9 shall not be increased unless specifically authorized by the
10 Legislature.
11 C. Pursuant to any approved Medicaid waiver and pursuant to

13 Fee shall not exceed the amount or rate allowed by federal law for
14 nursing home licensed bed days.
15 D. The Nursing Facilities Quality of Care Fee owed by a
16 licensed nursing facility shall be calculated by the Authority by
17 adding the daily patient census of a licensed nursing facility, as

19 multiplying the ensuing figure by the per-patient day rate
20 determined pursuant to the provisions of subsection B of this
21 section.
22 E. Each licensed nursing facility which is assessed the Nursing
23 Facilities Quality of Care Fee shall be required to file a report on
24 a monthly basis with the Authority detailing the daily patient

7 calendar year 1999 upon forms supplied by the Authority.
8 2. Annually the Nursing Facilities Quality of Care Fee shall be
9 determined by:

13 b. annualizing those figures.
14 Each year thereafter, the annualization of the Nursing
