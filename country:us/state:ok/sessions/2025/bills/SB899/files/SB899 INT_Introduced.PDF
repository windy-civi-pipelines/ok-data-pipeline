22
emancipated minor household member on behalf of any other family or
22

24
sixteen (16) or seventeen (17) years, or any adult victim of a crime
24
Req. No. 347 Page 1

1
may seek relief under the provisions of the Protection from Domestic
1
2
Abuse Act.
2
3
1. The person seeking relief may file a petition for a
3
4
protective order with the district court in the county in which the
4
5
victim resides, the county in which the defendant resides, or the
5
6
county in which the domestic violence occurred. If the person
6
7
seeking relief is not a family or household member or an individual
7
8
who is or has been in a dating relationship with the defendant, the
8
9
person seeking relief must file a complaint against the defendant
9
10
with the proper law enforcement agency before filing a petition for
10
11
a protective order with the district court. The person seeking
11
12
relief shall provide a copy of the complaint that was filed with the
12
13
law enforcement agency at the full hearing if the complaint is not
13
14
available from the law enforcement agency. Failure to provide a
14
15
copy of the complaint filed with the law enforcement agency shall
15
16
constitute a frivolous filing and the court may assess attorney fees
16
17
and court costs against the plaintiff pursuant to paragraph 2 of
17
18
subsection C of this section. The filing of a petition for a
18
19
protective order shall not require jurisdiction or venue of the
19
20
criminal offense if either the plaintiff or defendant resides in the
20
21
county. If a petition has been filed in an action for divorce or
21
22
separate maintenance and either party to the action files a petition
22
23
for a protective order in the same county where the action for
23
24
divorce or separate maintenance is filed, the petition for the
24
Req. No. 347 Page 2

1
protective order may be heard by the court hearing the divorce or
1
2
separate maintenance action if:
2
3
a. there is no established protective order docket in
3
4
such court, or
4
5
b. the court finds that, in the interest of judicial
5
6
economy, both actions may be heard together; provided,
6
7
however, the petition for a protective order,
7
8
including, but not limited to, a petition in which
8
9
children are named as petitioners, shall remain a
9
10
separate action and a separate order shall be entered
10
11
in the protective order action. Protective orders may
11
12
be dismissed in favor of restraining orders in the
12
13
divorce or separate maintenance action if the court
13
14
specifically finds, upon hearing, that such dismissal
14
15
is in the best interests of the parties and does not
15
16
compromise the safety of any petitioner.
16
17
If the defendant is a minor child, the petition shall be filed
17
18
with the court having jurisdiction over juvenile matters.
18
19
2. When the abuse occurs when the court is not open for
19
20
business, such person may request an emergency temporary order of
20
21
protection as authorized by Section 40.3 of this title.
21
22
3. A petition for a protective order may include all members of
22
23
the residence of the petitioner seeking relief as part of the same
23
24
petition.

Req. No. 347 Page 3

1
2
court. The Administrative Office of the Courts shall develop a
2
3
standard form for the petition.
3
4
C. 1. Except as otherwise provided by this section, no filing
4
5
fee, service of process fee, attorney fees or any other fee or costs
5
6
shall be charged the plaintiff or victim at any time for filing a
6
7
petition for a protective order whether a protective order is
7
8
granted or not granted. The court may assess court costs, service
8
9
of process fees, attorney fees, other fees and filing fees against
9
10
the defendant at the hearing on the petition, if a protective order
10
11
is granted against the defendant; provided, the court shall have
11
12
authority to waive the costs and fees if the court finds that the
12
13
party does not have the ability to pay the costs and fees.
13
14
2. If the court makes specific findings that a petition for a
14
15
protective order has been filed frivolously and no victim exists,
15
16
the court may assess attorney fees and court costs against the
16
17
plaintiff.
17
18
D. The person seeking relief shall prepare the petition or, at
18
19
the request of the plaintiff, the court clerk or the victim-witness
19
20
coordinator, victim support person, and court case manager shall
20
21
prepare or assist the plaintiff in preparing the petition.
21
22
E. The person seeking a protective order may further request
22
23
the exclusive care, possession, or control of any animal owned,
23
24
possessed, leased, kept, or held by either the petitioner, defendant
24
Req. No. 347 Page 4

or minor child residing in the residence of the petitioner or
1
2
defendant. The court may order the defendant to make no contact
2
3
with the animal and forbid the defendant from taking, transferring,
3
4
encumbering, concealing, molesting, attacking, striking,
4
5
threatening, harming, or otherwise disposing of the animal.

6
F. A court may not require the victim to seek legal sanctions
6
7
against the defendant including, but not limited to, divorce,
7
8
separation, paternity, or criminal proceedings prior to hearing a
8
9
petition for protective order.

10
G. A victim of rape, forcible sodomy, a sex offense,
10
11
kidnapping, assault and battery with a deadly weapon, child abuse,
11
12
or member of the immediate family of a victim of first-degree
12
13
murder, as such terms are defined in Section 40 of this title, may
13
14
petition, or have a petition filed on the victim’s behalf if the
14
15
victim is a minor, for an emergency temporary order or emergency ex
15
16
parte order regardless of any relationship or scenario pursuant to
16
17
the provisions of this section. The Administrative Office of the
