4
5
apportioned with property and payroll, each comprising twenty-five
5
6
percent (25%) of the apportionment factor and sales comprising fifty
6
7
percent (50%) of the apportionment factor. The apportionment
7
8
factors shall be computed as follows:
8
9
a. The property factor is a fraction, the numerator of
9
10
which is the average value of the taxpayer’s real and
10
11
tangible personal property owned or rented and used in
11
12
this state during the tax period and the denominator
12
13
of which is the average value of all the taxpayer’s
13
14
real and tangible personal property everywhere owned
14
15
or rented and used during the tax period.
15
16
(1) Property, the income from which is separately

3
state by such equipment bears to total miles
3
4
traveled,
4
5
(2) Property owned by the taxpayer is valued at its
5
6
original cost. Property rented by the taxpayer
6
7
is valued at eight times the net annual rental
7
8
rate. Net annual rental rate is the annual
8
9
rental rate paid by the taxpayer, less any annual
9
10
rental rate received by the taxpayer from
10
11
subrentals,
11
12
(3) The average value of property shall be determined
12
13
by averaging the values at the beginning and
13
14
ending of the tax period but the Oklahoma Tax
14
15
Commission may require the averaging of monthly
15
16
values during the tax period if reasonably
16
17
required to reflect properly the average value of
17
18
the taxpayer’s property;
18
19
b. The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of
19
20
which is the total compensation for services rendered
20
21
in the state during the tax period, and the
21
22
denominator of which is the total compensation for
22
23
services rendered everywhere during the tax period.
23
24
“Compensation”, as used in this subsection, means
24
Req. No. 1443 Page 24

operating equipment over a fixed route, such as
7
8
railroad employees, airline pilots, or bus
8
9
drivers, in this state only a part of the time,
9
10
in the proportion that mileage traveled in
10
11
Oklahoma this state bears to total mileage
11
12
traveled by such employees,
12
13
(2) In any case the numerator of the fraction shall
13
14
include a portion of such expenditures in
14
15
connection with itinerant employees, such as
15
16
traveling salespersons, in this state only a part
16
17
of the time, in the proportion that time spent in
17
18
Oklahoma this state bears to total time spent in
18
19
furtherance of the enterprise by such employees;
19
20
c. The sales factor is a fraction, the numerator of which
20
21
is the total sales or gross revenue of the taxpayer in
21
22
this state during the tax period, and the denominator
22
23
of which is the total sales or gross revenue of the
23
24
taxpayer everywhere during the tax period. “Sales”,
24
Req. No. 1443 Page 25

1
as used in this subsection, does not include sales or
1
2
gross revenue which are separately allocated in
2
3
paragraph 4 of this subsection.
3
4
(1) Sales of tangible personal property have a situs
4
5
in this state if the property is delivered or
5
6
shipped to a purchaser other than the United
6
7
States government, within this state regardless
7
8
of the FOB Freight on Board (FOB) point or other
8
9
conditions of the sale; or the property is
9
10
shipped from an office, store, warehouse, factory
10
11
or other place of storage in this state and (a)
11
12
the purchaser is the United States government or
12
13
(b) the taxpayer is not doing business in the
13
14
state of the destination of the shipment.
14
15
(2) In the case of a railroad or interurban railway
15
16
enterprise, the numerator of the fraction shall
16
17
not be less than the allocation of revenues to
17
18
this state as shown in its annual report to the
18
19
Corporation Commission.
19
20
(3) In the case of an airline, truck or bus

numerator of the fraction shall include a portion
23
24
of revenue from interstate transportation in the
24
Req. No. 1443 Page 26

1
proportion that interstate mileage traveled in
1
2
Oklahoma this state bears to total interstate
2
3
mileage traveled.
3
4
(4) In the case of an oil, gasoline or gas pipeline
4
5
enterprise, the numerator of the fraction shall
5
6
be either the total of traffic units of the
6
7
enterprise within Oklahoma this state or the
7
8
revenue allocated to Oklahoma this state based
8
9
upon miles moved, at the option of the taxpayer,
9
10
and the denominator of which shall be the total
10
11
of traffic units of the enterprise or the revenue
11
12
of the enterprise everywhere as appropriate to
12
13
the numerator. A “traffic unit” is hereby
13
14
defined as the transportation for a distance of
14
15
one (1) mile of one (1) barrel of oil, one (1)
15
16
gallon of gasoline or one thousand (1,000) cubic
16
17
feet of natural or casinghead gas, as the case
17
18
may be.
18
19
(5) In the case of a telephone or telegraph or other
19
20
communication enterprise, the numerator of the
20
21
fraction shall include that portion of the
21
22
interstate revenue as is allocated pursuant to
22
23
the accounting procedures prescribed by the

Req. No. 1443 Page 27

1
in respect to each corporation or business entity
1
2
required by the Federal Communications Commission
2
3
to keep its books and records in accordance with
3
4
a uniform system of accounts prescribed by such
4
5
Commission, the intrastate net income shall be
5
6
determined separately in the manner provided by
6
7
such uniform system of accounts and only the
7
8
interstate income shall be subject to allocation
8
9
pursuant to the provisions of this subsection.
9
10
Provided further, that the gross revenue factors
10
11
shall be those as are determined pursuant to the
11
12
accounting procedures prescribed by the Federal
12
13
Communications Commission.
13
14
In any case where the apportionment of the three factors
14
15
prescribed in this paragraph attributes to Oklahoma this state a
15
16
portion of net income of the enterprise out of all appropriate
16
17
proportion to the property owned and/or business transacted within
17
18
this state, because of the fact that one or more of the factors so
18
19
prescribed are not employed to any appreciable extent in furtherance
19
20
of the enterprise; or because one or more factors not so prescribed
20
21
are employed to a considerable extent in furtherance of the
21
22
enterprise; or because of other reasons, the Tax Commission is
22
23
empowered to permit, after a showing by taxpayer that an excessive
23
24
portion of net income has been attributed to Oklahoma this state, or
24
Req. No. 1443 Page 28

1
require, when in its judgment an insufficient portion of net income
1
2
has been attributed to Oklahoma this state, the elimination,
2
3
substitution, or use of additional factors, or reduction or increase
3
4
in the weight of such prescribed factors. Provided, however, that
4
5
any such variance from such prescribed factors which has the effect
5
6
of increasing the portion of net income attributable to Oklahoma
6
7
this state must not be inherently arbitrary, and application of the
7
8
recomputed final apportionment to the net income of the enterprise
8
9
must attribute to Oklahoma this state only a reasonable portion
9
10
thereof.
10
11
6. For calendar years 1997 and 1998, the owner of a new or
11
12
expanded agricultural commodity processing facility in this state

16
agricultural commodity processing facility. For calendar year 1999,

the exemption shall be adjusted annually so that the total estimated
20
21
reduction in tax liability does not exceed One Million Dollars
21
22
($1,000,000.00) annually. The Tax Commission shall promulgate rules
22
23
for determining the percentage of the investment which each eligible
23
24
taxpayer may exclude. The exclusion provided by this paragraph
24
Req. No. 1443 Page 29

shall be taken in the taxable year when the investment is made. In
1
2
the event the total reduction in tax liability authorized by this

paragraph exceeds One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) in any
3
4
calendar year, the Tax Commission shall permit any excess over One
4
5
Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) and shall factor such excess into
5
6
the percentage for subsequent years. Any amount of the exemption
6
7
permitted to be excluded pursuant to the provisions of this
7
8
paragraph but not used in any year may be carried forward as an
8
9
exemption from income pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph
9
10
for a period not exceeding six (6) years following the year in which
10
11
the investment was originally made.
