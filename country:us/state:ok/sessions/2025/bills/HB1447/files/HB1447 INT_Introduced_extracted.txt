15 otherwise applicable if it obtains a blanket exemption certificate
16 for a purchaser with which the seller has a recurring business
17 relationship. The Tax Commission shall not request from the seller

9 or all relevant data elements as provided by the Tax Commission, the
10 seller may, within one hundred twenty (120) days subsequent to a
11 request for substantiation, either prove that the transaction was
12 not subject to tax by other means or obtain a fully completed
13 exemption certificate from the purchaser, taken in good faith.
14 The Tax Commission shall relieve a seller or CSP of the tax
15 otherwise applicable if it obtains a blanket exemption certificate
16 for a purchaser with which the seller has a recurring business
17 relationship. The Tax Commission shall not request from the seller
18 or CSP renewal of blanket certificates or updates of exemption
19 certificate information or data elements when there is a recurring
20 business relationship between the buyer and seller. For purposes of
