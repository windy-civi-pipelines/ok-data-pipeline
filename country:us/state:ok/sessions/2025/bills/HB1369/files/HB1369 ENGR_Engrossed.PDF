18 letter of credit, cash, cashier's check, certificate, bond, receipt
19 or other negotiable instrument shall be in the amount of Twenty-five
20 Thousand Dollars ($25,000.00) but may be set higher at the
21 discretion of the Director of the Oil and Gas Conservation Division
22 based on the number of wells that the person operates as follows:
23 a. for one to ten wells, Twenty-five Thousand Dollars
24 ($25,000.00),
ENGR. H. B. NO. 1369 Page 2

7 The Commission is authorized to determine the a higher amount of

12 surface impoundments or removal of trash and equipment, provided
13 that such higher amount shall not exceed One Hundred Fifty Thousand
14 Dollars ($150,000.00). Any instrument shall constitute an
15 unconditional promise to pay and be in a form negotiable by the
16 Commission.
17 3. B. 1. The Commission upon certification by any operator
18 subject to Category B surety that its plugging liability statewide

20 on the number of wells operated as specified in this section may
21 allow said operator to provide Category B type surety in an amount
22 less than the amount required Twenty-five Thousand Dollars
23 ($25,000.00) by this section, but at least sufficient to cover the
24 estimated cost of all plugging, closure, and removal operations

2 certification referred to in this paragraph subsection shall take
3 the form of an affidavit from a licensed well plugger estimating the
4 costs of all plugging, closure, and removal operations of the
5 operator requesting such relief. This alternative amount shall be
6 modified upward upon the assumption of additional operations by such
7 operator, the maximum amount of Category B surety to be posted not
8 to exceed the twenty-five-thousand-dollar total unless as provided
9 previously One Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($150,000.00).

15 contempt citations and operators whose insiders or affiliates have

18 Category B surety and have operated under this type surety and have
19 no outstanding fines at the end of three (3) years may post Category
20 A surety.

22 Two Thousand Dollars ($2,000.00) or more and who do not pay the fine
23 within the specified time shall be required to post a Category B
24 surety within thirty (30) days of notification by the Commission.

8 Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000.00) One Hundred Fifty Thousand
9 Dollars ($150,000.00).

12 operator shall cause the wells to be plugged and abandoned surface
13 impoundments to be closed, and trash and equipment to be removed in
14 accordance with the laws of this state and the rules of the
15 Commission. Each bond shall be executed by a corporate surety
16 authorized to do business in this state and shall be renewed and
17 continued in effect until the conditions have been met or release of
18 the bond is authorized by the Commission.

2 forfeit from his or her bond, letter of credit or negotiable
3 instrument or shall pay to this state, through the Commission, for
4 deposit in the State Treasury, a sum equal to the cost of plugging
5 the well, closure of any surface impoundment or removal of trash and
6 equipment. The Commission may cause the remedial work to be done,
7 issuing a warrant in payment of the cost thereof drawn against the
8 monies accruing in the State Treasury from the forfeiture or
9 payment. Any monies accruing in the State Treasury by reason of a
10 determination that there has been a noncompliance with the
11 provisions of the agreement or the rules of the Commission, in
12 excess of the cost of remedial action ordered by the Commission,
13 shall be credited to the Oil and Gas Revolving Fund. The Commission
14 shall also recover any costs arising from litigation to enforce this
15 provision. Provided, before a person is required to forfeit or pay
16 any monies to the state pursuant to this section, the Commission
17 shall notify the person at his or her last-known address of the
18 determination of neglect, failure or refusal to plug or replug any
19 well, or close any surface impoundment or remove trash and equipment
20 and said person shall have ten (10) days from the date of
21 notification within which to commence remedial operations. Failure
