Req. No. 13372 Page 46

1 12. A finding that the parent whose rights are sought to be

22 a. the parent has a diagnosed cognitive disorder, an
23 extreme physical incapacity, or a medical condition,
24 including behavioral health, which renders the parent

12 extreme physical incapacity, or a medical condition, including
13 behavioral health or substance dependency, shall not in and of

21 the conditions which led to the determination of the
22 initial deprived child;
23 15. A finding that there exists a substantial erosion of the
24 relationship between the parent and child caused at least in part by
Req. No. 13372 Page 48

1 the parent's serious or aggravated neglect of the child, physical or
2 sexual abuse or exploitation of the child, a prolonged and
3 unreasonable absence of the parent from the child or an unreasonable
4 failure by the parent to visit or communicate in a meaningful way
5 with the child;
6 16. A finding that a child four (4) years of age or older at
7 the time of placement has been placed in foster care by the
8 Department of Human Services for fifteen (15) of the most recent
9 twenty-two (22) months preceding the filing of the petition or
10 motion for termination of parental rights and the child cannot, at
11 the time of the filing of the petition or motion, be safely returned
12 to the home of the parent. For purposes of this paragraph, a child

5 termination of parental rights will provide the most
6 secure and appropriate placement for the child,

8 firmly opposed to termination of parental rights, and
9 is likely to disrupt an attempt to place the child
10 with an adoptive family,

12 want parental rights to be terminated, and has
13 designated a guardian for the child,
14 e. the child is not capable of functioning if placed in a
15 family setting. In such a case, the court shall
16 reevaluate the status of the child every ninety (90)
17 days unless there is a court determination that the

19 f. the child is an unaccompanied, refugee minor and the

21 foreign policy issues,
22 g. adoption is not an appropriate plan for the child,
23 h. the parent's incarceration constitutes the primary

2 best interest,
3 i. the parent's participation in a court-ordered

6 placement in substitute care and termination of
7 parental rights is not in the child's best interest,

9 considered to have entered foster care on the earlier
10 of:
11 (1) the adjudication date, or
12 (2) the date that is sixty (60) days after the date
13 on which the child is removed from the home, or
14 k. the court may also consider:
15 (1) circumstances of the failure of the parent to

17 child in a meaningful, supportive manner, and
18 (2) whether allowing the parent to have custody would
19 likely cause the child actual serious
20 psychological harm or harm in the near future as
21 a result of the removal of the child from the
22 substitute caregiver due to the existence of a
23 strong and positive bond between the child and
24 caregiver; and
Req. No. 13372 Page 51

1 17. A finding that a child younger than four (4) years of age
2 at the time of placement has been placed in foster care by the
3 Department of Human Services for at least six (6) of the twelve (12)
4 months preceding the filing of the petition or motion for
5 termination of parental rights and the child cannot be safely
6 returned to the home of the parent.

11 (2) the date that is sixty (60) days after the date
12 on which the child is removed from the home.
13 b. For purposes of this paragraph, the court may
14 consider:
15 (1) circumstances of the failure of the parent to
16 develop and maintain a parental bond with the
17 child in a meaningful, supportive manner, and
18 (2) whether allowing the parent to have custody would
19 likely cause the child actual serious
20 psychological harm or harm in the near future as
21 a result of the removal of the child from the
22 substitute caregiver due to the existence of a
23 strong, positive bond between the child and
24 caregiver.

8 SECTION 6. AMENDATORY 10A O.S. 2021, Section 2-2-104, is
9 amended to read as follows:
10 Section 2-2-104. A. A preliminary inquiry shall be conducted
11 to determine whether the interests of the public or of the child who
12 is within the purview of the Oklahoma Juvenile Code require that
13 further court action be taken. If it is determined by the
14 preliminary inquiry that no further action be taken and if agreed to
15 by the district attorney, the intake worker may make such informal
16 adjustment without a petition.
17 B. In the course of the preliminary inquiry, the intake worker
18 shall:
19 1. Hold conferences with the child and the parents, guardian or
20 custodian of the child for the purpose of discussing the disposition
21 of the referral made;
22 2. Interview such persons as necessary to determine whether the
23 filing of a petition would be in the best interests of the child and
24 the community;
Req. No. 13372 Page 53

1 3. Check existing records of any district court or tribal
2 court, law enforcement agencies, Office of Juvenile Affairs, and

5 records of the child with the consent of the parents, guardian or
6 custodian of the child or by court order; and
7 5. Administer any screening and assessment instruments or refer
8 for necessary screening and assessments to assist in the
9 determination of any immediate needs of the child as well as the
10 immediate risks to the community. All screening and assessment
11 instruments shall be uniformly used by all intake workers, including
12 those employed by juvenile bureaus, and shall be instruments
13 specifically prescribed by the Office of Juvenile Affairs.
14 C. Upon review of any information presented in the preliminary
15 inquiry, the district attorney may consult with the intake worker to
16 determine whether the interests of the child and the public will be
17 best served by the dismissal of the complaint, the informal
18 adjustment of the complaint, or the filing of a petition.
19 D. Informal adjustment may be provided to the child If a child
20 is charged with a delinquent act as a result of a first-time,
21 nonviolent offense which would be a misdemeanor if committed by an
22 adult, an informal adjustment shall be considered for the child,
23 pursuant to the guidelines in subsection E of this section, by the
24 intake worker only where the facts reasonably appear to establish
Req. No. 13372 Page 54

1 prim a facie jurisdiction and are admitted and where consent is
2 obtained from the district attorney, the parent of the child, legal
3 guardian, legal custodian, or legal counsel, if any, and the child.
4 E. The informal adjustment is an agreement whereby the child
5 agrees to fulfill certain conditions in exchange for not having a
6 petition filed against the child. The informal adjustment shall be
7 completed within a period of time not to exceed six (6) months and
8 shall:
9 1. Be voluntarily entered into by all parties;
10 2. Be revocable by the child at any time by a written
11 revocation;
12 3. Be revocable by the intake worker in the event there is
13 reasonable cause to believe the child has failed to carry out the
14 terms of the informal adjustment or has committed a subsequent
15 offense;
16 4. Not be used as evidence against the child at any
17 adjudication hearing;
18 5. Be executed in writing and expressed in language
19 understandable to the persons involved; and
20 6. Become part of the juvenile record of the child.
21 E. F. The informal adjustment agreement under this section may
22 include, among other suitable methods, programs and procedures, the
23 following:
24
Req. No. 13372 Page 55

1 1. Participation in or referral to counseling, a period of
2 community service, drug or alcohol education or treatment,
3 vocational training or any other legal activity which in the opinion
4 of the intake officer would be beneficial to the child and family of
5 the child;
6 2. Require the child to undergo a behavioral health evaluation
7 and, if warranted, undergo appropriate care or treatment;
8 3. Restitution providing for monetary payment by the parents or
9 child to the victim who was physically injured or who suffered loss
10 of or damage to property as a result of the conduct alleged. Before
11 setting the amount of restitution, the intake officer shall consult
12 with the victim concerning the amount of damages; or
13 4. Informal adjustment projects, programs and services may be
14 provided through public or private agencies.
15 If the intake worker has reasonable cause to believe that the child
16 has failed to carry out the terms of the adjustment agreement or has
17 committed a subsequent offense, in lieu of revoking the agreement,
18 the intake worker may modify the terms of the agreement and extend
19 the period of the agreement for an additional six (6) months from
20 the date on which the modification was made with the consent of the
21 child or counsel of the child, if any.
22 F. G. If an informal adjustment is agreed to pursuant to
23 subsection D of this section, the informal adjustment agreement may
24 require the child to pay a fee equal to no more than what the court
Req. No. 13372 Page 56

1 cost s would have been had a petition been filed. The child shall
2 remit the fee directly to the agency responsible for the monitoring
3 and supervision of the child. If the supervising agency is a
4 juvenile bureau, then the fee shall be remitted to a revolving fund
5 of the county in which the juvenile bureau is located to be
6 designated the "Juvenile Deferral Fee Revolving Fund" and shall be
7 used by the juvenile bureau to defray costs for the operation of the
8 juvenile bureau. In those counties without juvenile bureaus and in
9 which the Office of Juvenile Affairs or one of their contracting
10 agencies provides the monitoring and supervision of the juvenile,
11 the fee shall be paid directly to the Office of Juvenile Affairs and
12 shall be used to defray the costs for the operation of the Office of
13 Juvenile Affairs.
14 H. The Office of Juvenile Affairs shall conduct an assessment
15 for any child who successfully completes an informal adjustment
16 utilizing program evaluations and data collection. The collected
17 data may include, but shall not be limited to:
18 1. Recidivism;
19 2. School engagement;
20 3. Social engagement; and
21 4. Graduation rates.
22 SECTION 7. This act shall become effective November 1, 2025.
