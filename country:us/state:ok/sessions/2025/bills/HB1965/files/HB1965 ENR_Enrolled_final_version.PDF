15. A finding that there exists a substantial erosion of the
relationship between the parent and child caused at least in part by
the parent’s serious or aggravated neglect of the child, physical or
sexual abuse or exploitation of the child, a prolonged and
unreasonable absence of the parent from the child or an unreasonable
failure by the parent to visit or communicate in a meaningful way
with the child;

Section 138:
16. A finding that a child four (4) years of age or older at
the time of placement has been placed in foster care by the
Department of Human Services for fifteen (15) of the most recent
twenty-two (22) months preceding the filing of the petition or
motion for termination of parental rights and the child cannot, at
the time of the filing of the petition or motion, be safely returned
to the home of the parent. For purposes of this paragraph, a child
shall be considered to have entered foster care on the earlier of:
a. the adjudication date, or
b. the date that is sixty (60) days after the date on
which the child is removed from the home
has been in foster care for not less than fifteen (15) months of the
most recent twenty-two (22) months and that the parent has not
corrected the circumstances which led the child to be adjudicated to
be a deprived child, unless:
a. a parent has made substantial progress toward
eliminating the problem that caused the child’s
placement in foster care, it is likely that the child
will be able to safely return to the parent’s home
within ninety (90) days, and the child’s return to the
parent’s home will be in the child’s best interests,
ENR. H. B. NO. 1965 Page 34
b. the child has a close and positive relationship with a
parent and a permanent plan that does not include
termination of parental rights will provide the most
secure and appropriate placement for the child,
c. the child is twelve (12) years of age or older, is
firmly opposed to termination of parental rights, and
is likely to disrupt an attempt to place the child
with an adoptive family,
d. a parent is terminally ill but in remission, does not
want parental rights to be terminated, and has
designated a guardian for the child,
e. the child is not capable of functioning if placed in a
family setting. In such a case, the court shall
reevaluate the status of the child every ninety (90)
days unless there is a court determination that the
child cannot be placed in a family setting,
f. the child is an unaccompanied, refugee minor and the
case involves international legal issues or compelling
foreign policy issues,
g. adoption is not an appropriate plan for the child,
h. the parent’s incarceration constitutes the primary
factor in the child’s placement in substitute care and
termination of parental rights is not in the child’s
best interest, or
i. the parent’s participation in a court-ordered
residential substance abuse treatment program
constitutes the primary factor in the child’s
placement in substitute care and termination of
parental rights is not in the child’s best interest.
For purposes of this paragraph, a child shall be considered to
have entered foster care on the earlier of the adjudication date, or
the date that is sixty (60) days after the date on which the child
is removed from the home.
The court may also consider circumstances of the failure of the
parent to develop and maintain a parental bond with the child in a
meaningful, supportive manner, and whether allowing the parent to
ENR. H. B. NO. 1965 Page 35
have custody would likely cause the child actual serious
psychological harm or harm in the near future as a result of the
removal of the child from the substitute caregiver due to the
existence of a strong and positive bond between the child and
caregiver; and

Section 139:
17. A finding that a child younger than four (4) years of age
at the time of placement has been placed in foster care by the
Department of Human Services for at least six (6) of the twelve (12)
months preceding the filing of the petition or motion for
termination of parental rights and the child cannot be safely
returned to the home of the parent.
a. For purposes of this paragraph, a child shall be
considered to have entered foster care on the earlier
of:
(1) the adjudication date, or
(2) the date that is sixty (60) days after the date
on which the child is removed from the home.
b. For purposes of this paragraph, the court may
consider:
(1) circumstances of the failure of the parent to
develop and maintain a parental bond with the
child in a meaningful, supportive manner, and
(2) whether allowing the parent to have custody would
likely cause the child actual serious
psychological harm or harm in the near future as
a result of the removal of the child from the
substitute caregiver due to the existence of a
strong, positive bond between the child and
caregiver.
C. An order directing the termination of parental rights is a
final appealable order.
D. The provisions of this section shall not apply to adoption
proceedings and actions to terminate parental rights which do not
involve a petition for deprived status of the child. Such
proceedings and actions shall be governed by the Oklahoma Adoption
Code.
ENR. H. B. NO. 1965 Page 36

Section 140:
SECTION 6. AMENDATORY 10A O.S. 2021, Section 2-2-104.1,
is amended to read as follows:

Section 141:
Section 2-2-104.1. A. Diversion services shall be offered to
children who are at risk of being the subject of a child-in-need-of-
supervision petition. Diversion services shall be designed to
provide an immediate response to families in crisis and to divert
children from court proceedings. Diversion services may be provided
by outside agencies as designated by the district courts, juvenile
bureaus, court employees, or a combination thereof. If a child
would be charged with a delinquent act as a result of a first-time
offense which would be a misdemeanor if committed by an adult,
diversion services shall be provided prior to the district attorney
filing a petition alleging the child to be in need of supervision or
upon the assumption of custody pursuant to Section 2-2-101 of this
title.
B. Diversion services shall clearly document diligent attempts
to provide appropriate services to the child and the family of the
child unless it is determined that there is no substantial
likelihood that the child and family of the child will benefit from
further diversion attempts.
C. Where the primary issue is truancy, steps taken by the
school district to improve the attendance or conduct of the child in
school shall be reviewed and attempts to engage the school district
in further diversion attempts shall be made if it appears that such
attempts will be beneficial to the child.
D. Efforts to prevent the filing of the petition may extend
until it is determined that there is no substantial likelihood that
the child and family of the child will benefit from further
attempts. Efforts at diversion may continue after the filing of the
petition where it is determined that the child and family of the
child will benefit therefrom.
E. A child-in-need-of-supervision petition shall not be filed
during the period that the designated agency, juvenile bureau, or
court employee is providing the diversion services. A finding that
the case has been successfully diverted shall constitute presumptive
evidence that the underlying allegations have been successfully
resolved.
ENR. H. B. NO. 1965 Page 37
F. The designated agency, juvenile bureau, or court employee
shall promptly give written notice to the child and family of the
child whenever attempts to prevent the filing of the petition have
terminated and shall indicate in the notice whether the efforts were
successful or whether a child-in-need-of-supervision petition should
be filed with the court. A petition may or may not be filed where
diversion services have been terminated because the parent or other
person legally responsible for the child failed to consent to the
diversion plan or failed to actively participate in the services
provided.
G. Diversion services shall include, but not be limited to,
Functional Family Therapy, first-time offender programs, community-
at-risk services, or other similar programs.
H. The Office of Juvenile Affairs shall evaluate the rate of
recidivism for children who are offered diversion services and shall
publish the rate publicly in the Office’s annual report. Data
disclosed in the annual report shall be unidentifiable to an
individual.

Section 142:
SECTION 7. AMENDATORY 30 O.S. 2021, Section 2-101, is
amended to read as follows:

Section 143:
Section 2-101. A. The court of each county, when it appears
necessary or convenient, may appoint guardians for the persons and
estates, or either, or both of them, of minors. When appointing
guardians, preference shall be given to relatives and persons who
have a kinship relationship with the minor.
B. Such appointment may be made on the verified petition of a
relative or other person in behalf of such minor.
C. 1. Before making the appointment, the court may receive an
investigation and report regarding the background and home of the
prospective guardian. The investigation and report of the
prospective guardian and placement restrictions and requirements
shall be made pursuant to the requirements of the Oklahoma Adoption
Code. In determining whether to require a home study pursuant to
the provisions of this paragraph, the court shall balance the need
for a home study to protect the best interests of the minor with the
ability of the prospective guardian to pay for the home study.

Section 144:
2. a. Costs of the home study shall be assessed against any
private child-placing agency having custody of the
ENR. H. B. NO. 1965 Page 38
child, or the person having legal custody of the child
or the prospective guardians of the child.
b. (1) For any child in the custody of the Department of
Human Services or the Department of Juvenile
Justice Office of Juvenile Affairs, the
applicable Department shall conduct or provide
for the home study for such child as required by
the Oklahoma Children’s Code or the Oklahoma
Juvenile Code.
(2) The Department of Human Services or the
Department of Juvenile Justice Office of Juvenile
Affairs shall not be required by any court to
conduct or provide for a home study and report to
the court on guardianship placements for any
child that is not in the custody of either
Department.

Section 145:
3. An order appointing a guardian of the minor who has a parent
living or other person legally responsible for the child shall
comply with the provisions of Section 2-108 of this title.

Section 146:
4. Except in the case of an emergency guardianship placement,
the court shall receive a background check for a prospective
guardian and all other household members eighteen (18) years of age
and older, consisting of a review of a national fingerprint-based
criminal background check or an Oklahoma State Bureau of
Investigation name-based criminal history background check, a search
of the Department of Corrections’ files maintained pursuant to the
Sex Offenders Registration Act, and a search of the child abuse and
neglect information system (CANIS) maintained for review by
authorized entities by the Department of Human Services. The
Department may charge a fee not to exceed Thirty-five Dollars
($35.00) for each search performed pursuant to this paragraph. In
the case of an emergency placement, the court may waive the
requirement for a CANIS search if it cannot be obtained in a
reasonable time and the court determines that it is in the minor’s
best interest that the CANIS search be waived.
D. In addition, before making the appointment, the court must
cause notice of the hearing on the petition for appointment of a
guardian for a minor to be given in the form required by the court
to the minor if the minor has attained the age of fourteen (14) as
ENR. H. B. NO. 1965 Page 39
of the date the petition is filed. The court shall also cause
notice to be sent to the following persons:

Section 147:
1. The then-living parents of the minor and any other person
having custody of the minor, if such parent or person is not one of
the petitioners;

Section 148:
2. If the minor has no then-living parent, then to one of the
then-living grandparents who is not one of the petitioners and who
is not married to one of the petitioners; and

Section 149:
3. If there is no such then-living grandparent or if there is
no such then-living grandparent whose address is known to the
petitioner, then notice shall be given to an adult relative, if any,
of the minor residing in the county in which the petition was filed.
E. Such notice shall be mailed to each person entitled to
notice pursuant to this section, at that person’s address as last-
known to the petitioner, at least ten (10) days prior to the date
set by the court for hearing on the petition. Provided, the court
may direct a shorter notice period if the court deems such shorter
notice period to be appropriate under the circumstances. If there
is no person other than the minor who is entitled to notice, or if
the address of any person, other than the minor, who is entitled to
notice is not known to the petitioner, the petition shall so allege.
The court may direct that notice, other than notice to the minor if
the minor has attained the age of fourteen (14), be waived or be
given to any person or persons other than the minor in such manner
as the court determines and directs.

Section 150:
SECTION 8. This act shall become effective November 1, 2025.

not limited to, identification of the treatment and services to be
provided to the child and the child’s family upon discharge of the
child from inpatient behavioral health or substance abuse treatment.
I. Prior to adjudication, a parent or legal guardian may
voluntarily participate in services related to the behaviors and
conditions that led to the filing of a deprived petition.
Participation in such services shall not be construed as an
admission that the child is deprived and shall not be used as
evidence for the purpose of adjudication or disposition.
ENR. H. B. NO. 1965 Page 26

SECTION 4. AMENDATORY 10A O.S. 2021, Section 1-4-902, is
amended to read as follows:

1. Prior to the end of the fifteenth month when a child has
been placed in foster care by the Department of Human Services for

abuse or chronic neglect of the child’s sibling,
h. murder of any child or aiding or abetting, attempting,
conspiring in, or soliciting to commit murder of any
child,
i. voluntary manslaughter of any child,
j. a felony assault that has resulted in serious bodily
injury to the child or another child of the parent, or
k. murder or voluntary manslaughter of the child’s parent
or aiding or abetting, attempting, conspiring in, or
soliciting to commit murder of the child’s parent; or
4. No later than ninety (90) days after the court has ordered
the individualized service plan if the parent has made no measurable
progress in correcting the conditions which caused the child to be
adjudicated deprived; or
5. After a period of fifteen (15) months if a parent has not
corrected the circumstances which led the child to be adjudicated to
be a deprived child and if the court makes a finding pursuant to
paragraph 16 of subsection B of Section 1-4-904 of this title.
B. If any of the following conditions exist, the district
attorney is not required to file a petition as provided in
subsection A of this section for a deprived child:
1. At the option of the Department or by order of the court,
the child is properly being cared for by a relative;
2. The Department has documented a compelling reason for
determining that filing a petition to terminate parental rights
would not serve the best interests of the child that may include
consideration of any of the following circumstances:
a. the parents or legal guardians have maintained a
relationship with the child and the child would
benefit from continuing this relationship,
ENR. H. B. NO. 1965 Page 28

b. the child, who is twelve (12) years of age or older,
objects to the termination of the parent-child legal
relationship,
c. the foster parents of the child are unable to adopt
the child because of exceptional circumstances which
do not include an unwillingness to accept legal
responsibility for the child but are willing and
capable of providing the child with a stable and
permanent environment, and the removal of the child
from the physical custody of the foster parents would
be seriously detrimental to the emotional well-being
of the child because the child has substantial
psychological ties to the foster parents,
d. the child is not capable of achieving stability if
placed in a family setting, or
e. the child is an unaccompanied, refugee minor and the
situation regarding the child involves international
legal issues or compelling foreign policy issues; or
3. The state has not provided to the family of the child,
consistent with the time period in the state case plan, services
that the state deems necessary for the safe return of the child to
the child’s home, if reasonable efforts are required to be made with
respect to the child.
SECTION 5. AMENDATORY 10A O.S. 2021, Section 1-4-904, is
amended to read as follows:
Section 1-4-904. A. A court shall not terminate the rights of
a parent to a child unless:
1. The child has been adjudicated to be deprived either prior
to or concurrently with a proceeding to terminate parental rights;
and
2. Termination of parental rights is in the best interests of
the child.
B. The court may terminate the rights of a parent to a child
based upon the following legal grounds:
ENR. H. B. NO. 1965 Page 29

1. Upon the duly acknowledged written consent of a parent, who
voluntarily agrees to termination of parental rights.
a. The voluntary consent for termination of parental
rights shall be signed under oath and recorded before
a judge of a court of competent jurisdiction and
accompanied by the judge’s certificate that the terms
and consequences of the consent were fully explained
in detail in English and were fully understood by the
parent or that the consent was translated into a
language that the parent understood.
b. A voluntary consent for termination of parental rights
is effective when it is signed and may not be revoked
except upon clear and convincing evidence that the
consent was executed by reason of fraud or duress.
c. However, notwithstanding the provisions in this
paragraph, in any proceeding for a voluntary
termination of parental rights to an Indian child, the
consent of the parent may be withdrawn for any reason
at any time prior to the entry of a final decree of
termination. Any consent given prior to, or within
ten (10) days after, the birth of an Indian child
shall not be valid;
2. A finding that a parent who is entitled to custody of the
child has abandoned the child;
3. A finding that the child is an abandoned infant;
4. A finding that the parent of a child:
a. has voluntarily placed physical custody of the child
with the Department of Human Services or with a child-
placing agency for out-of-home placement,
b. has not complied with the placement agreement, and
c. has not demonstrated during such period a firm
intention to resume physical custody of the child or
to make permanent legal arrangements for the care of
the child;
5. A finding that:
ENR. H. B. NO. 1965 Page 30

a. the parent has failed to correct the condition which
led to the deprived adjudication of the child, and
b. the parent has been given at least three (3) months to
correct the condition;
6. A finding that:
a. the rights of the parent to another child have been
terminated, and
b. the conditions that led to the prior termination of
parental rights have not been corrected;
7. A finding that a parent who does not have custody of the
child has, for at least six (6) out of the twelve (12) months
immediately preceding the filing of the petition or motion for
termination of parental rights, willfully failed or refused or has
neglected to contribute to the support of the child:
a. as specified by an order entered by a court of
competent jurisdiction adjudicating the duty, amount
and manner of support, or
b. where an order of child support does not exist,
according to the financial ability of the parent to
contribute to the child’s support.
Incidental or token support shall not be construed or considered in
establishing whether a parent has maintained or contributed to the
support of the child;
8. A finding that the parent has been convicted in a court of
competent jurisdiction in any state of any of the following acts:
a. permitting a child to participate in pornography child
sexual abuse material,
b. rape, or rape by instrumentation,
c. lewd molestation of a child under sixteen (16) years
of age,
d. child abuse or neglect,
ENR. H. B. NO. 1965 Page 31

e. enabling child abuse or neglect,
f. causing the death of a child as a result of the
physical or sexual abuse or chronic abuse or chronic
neglect of the child,
g. causing the death of a sibling of the child as a
result of the physical or sexual abuse or chronic
abuse or chronic neglect of the child’s sibling,
h. murder of any child or aiding or abetting, attempting,
conspiring, or soliciting to commit murder of any
child,
i. voluntary manslaughter of any child,
j. a felony assault that has resulted in serious bodily
injury to the child or another child of the parents,
or
k. murder or voluntary manslaughter of the child’s parent
or aiding or abetting, attempting, conspiring, or
soliciting to commit murder of the child’s parent;
9. A finding that the parent has abused or neglected any child
or failed to protect any child from abuse or neglect that is heinous
or shocking;
10. A finding that the parent has previously abused or
neglected the child or a sibling of the child or failed to protect
the child or a sibling of the child from abuse or neglect and the
child or a sibling of the child has been subjected to subsequent
abuse;
11. A finding that the child was conceived as a result of rape
perpetrated by the parent whose rights are sought to be terminated;
12. A finding that the parent whose rights are sought to be
terminated is incarcerated, and the continuation of parental rights
would result in harm to the child based on consideration of the
following factors, among others:
a. the duration of incarceration and its detrimental
effect on the parent/child relationship,
ENR. H. B. NO. 1965 Page 32

b. any previous convictions resulting in involuntary
confinement in a secure facility,
c. the parent’s history of criminal behavior, including
crimes against children,
d. the age of the child,
e. any evidence of abuse or neglect or failure to protect
from abuse or neglect of the child or siblings of the
child by the parent,
f. the current relationship between the parent and the
child, and
g. the manner in which the parent has exercised parental
rights and duties in the past.
Provided, that the incarceration of a parent shall not in and of
itself be sufficient to deprive a parent of parental rights;
13. A finding that all of the following exist:
a. the parent has a diagnosed cognitive disorder, an
extreme physical incapacity, or a medical condition,
including behavioral health, which renders the parent
incapable of adequately and appropriately exercising
parental rights, duties, and responsibilities within a
reasonable time considering the age of the child, and
b. allowing the parent to have custody would cause the
child actual harm or harm in the near future.
A parent’s refusal or pattern of noncompliance with treatment,
therapy, medication, or assistance from outside the home can be used
as evidence that the parent is incapable of adequately and
appropriately exercising parental rights, duties, and
responsibilities.
A finding that a parent has a diagnosed cognitive disorder, an
extreme physical incapacity, or a medical condition, including
behavioral health or substance dependency, shall not in and of
itself deprive the parent of parental rights;
ENR. H. B. NO. 1965 Page 33

14. A finding that:
a. the condition that led to the deprived adjudication
has been the subject of a previous deprived
adjudication of this child or a sibling of this child,
and
b. the parent has been given an opportunity to correct
the conditions which led to the determination of the
initial deprived child;
15. A finding that there exists a substantial erosion of the
relationship between the parent and child caused at least in part by
the parent’s serious or aggravated neglect of the child, physical or
sexual abuse or exploitation of the child, a prolonged and
unreasonable absence of the parent from the child or an unreasonable
failure by the parent to visit or communicate in a meaningful way
with the child;
16. A finding that a child four (4) years of age or older at
the time of placement has been placed in foster care by the
Department of Human Services for fifteen (15) of the most recent
twenty-two (22) months preceding the filing of the petition or
motion for termination of parental rights and the child cannot, at
the time of the filing of the petition or motion, be safely returned
to the home of the parent. For purposes of this paragraph, a child
shall be considered to have entered foster care on the earlier of:
a. the adjudication date, or
b. the date that is sixty (60) days after the date on
which the child is removed from the home
has been in foster care for not less than fifteen (15) months of the
most recent twenty-two (22) months and that the parent has not
corrected the circumstances which led the child to be adjudicated to
be a deprived child, unless:
a. a parent has made substantial progress toward
eliminating the problem that caused the child’s
placement in foster care, it is likely that the child
will be able to safely return to the parent’s home
within ninety (90) days, and the child’s return to the
parent’s home will be in the child’s best interests,
ENR. H. B. NO. 1965 Page 34

b. the child has a close and positive relationship with a
parent and a permanent plan that does not include
termination of parental rights will provide the most
secure and appropriate placement for the child,
c. the child is twelve (12) years of age or older, is
firmly opposed to termination of parental rights, and
is likely to disrupt an attempt to place the child
with an adoptive family,
d. a parent is terminally ill but in remission, does not
want parental rights to be terminated, and has
designated a guardian for the child,
e. the child is not capable of functioning if placed in a
family setting. In such a case, the court shall
reevaluate the status of the child every ninety (90)
days unless there is a court determination that the
child cannot be placed in a family setting,
f. the child is an unaccompanied, refugee minor and the
case involves international legal issues or compelling
foreign policy issues,
g. adoption is not an appropriate plan for the child,
h. the parent’s incarceration constitutes the primary
factor in the child’s placement in substitute care and
termination of parental rights is not in the child’s
best interest, or
i. the parent’s participation in a court-ordered
residential substance abuse treatment program
constitutes the primary factor in the child’s
placement in substitute care and termination of
parental rights is not in the child’s best interest.
For purposes of this paragraph, a child shall be considered to
have entered foster care on the earlier of the adjudication date, or
the date that is sixty (60) days after the date on which the child
is removed from the home.
The court may also consider circumstances of the failure of the
parent to develop and maintain a parental bond with the child in a
meaningful, supportive manner, and whether allowing the parent to
ENR. H. B. NO. 1965 Page 35

have custody would likely cause the child actual serious
psychological harm or harm in the near future as a result of the
removal of the child from the substitute caregiver due to the
existence of a strong and positive bond between the child and
caregiver; and
17. A finding that a child younger than four (4) years of age
at the time of placement has been placed in foster care by the
Department of Human Services for at least six (6) of the twelve (12)
months preceding the filing of the petition or motion for
termination of parental rights and the child cannot be safely
returned to the home of the parent.
a. For purposes of this paragraph, a child shall be
considered to have entered foster care on the earlier
of:
(1) the adjudication date, or
(2) the date that is sixty (60) days after the date
on which the child is removed from the home.
b. For purposes of this paragraph, the court may
consider:
(1) circumstances of the failure of the parent to
develop and maintain a parental bond with the
child in a meaningful, supportive manner, and
(2) whether allowing the parent to have custody would
likely cause the child actual serious
psychological harm or harm in the near future as
a result of the removal of the child from the
substitute caregiver due to the existence of a
strong, positive bond between the child and
caregiver.
C. An order directing the termination of parental rights is a
final appealable order.
D. The provisions of this section shall not apply to adoption
proceedings and actions to terminate parental rights which do not
involve a petition for deprived status of the child. Such
proceedings and actions shall be governed by the Oklahoma Adoption
Code.
ENR. H. B. NO. 1965 Page 36

SECTION 6. AMENDATORY 10A O.S. 2021, Section 2-2-104.1,
is amended to read as follows:
Section 2-2-104.1. A. Diversion services shall be offered to
children who are at risk of being the subject of a child-in-need-of-
supervision petition. Diversion services shall be designed to
provide an immediate response to families in crisis and to divert
children from court proceedings. Diversion services may be provided
by outside agencies as designated by the district courts, juvenile
bureaus, court employees, or a combination thereof. If a child
would be charged with a delinquent act as a result of a first-time
offense which would be a misdemeanor if committed by an adult,
diversion services shall be provided prior to the district attorney
filing a petition alleging the child to be in need of supervision or
upon the assumption of custody pursuant to Section 2-2-101 of this
title.
B. Diversion services shall clearly document diligent attempts
to provide appropriate services to the child and the family of the
child unless it is determined that there is no substantial
likelihood that the child and family of the child will benefit from
further diversion attempts.
C. Where the primary issue is truancy, steps taken by the
school district to improve the attendance or conduct of the child in
school shall be reviewed and attempts to engage the school district
in further diversion attempts shall be made if it appears that such
attempts will be beneficial to the child.
D. Efforts to prevent the filing of the petition may extend
until it is determined that there is no substantial likelihood that
the child and family of the child will benefit from further
attempts. Efforts at diversion may continue after the filing of the
petition where it is determined that the child and family of the
child will benefit therefrom.
E. A child-in-need-of-supervision petition shall not be filed
during the period that the designated agency, juvenile bureau, or
court employee is providing the diversion services. A finding that
the case has been successfully diverted shall constitute presumptive
evidence that the underlying allegations have been successfully
resolved.
ENR. H. B. NO. 1965 Page 37

F. The designated agency, juvenile bureau, or court employee
shall promptly give written notice to the child and family of the
child whenever attempts to prevent the filing of the petition have
terminated and shall indicate in the notice whether the efforts were
successful or whether a child-in-need-of-supervision petition should
be filed with the court. A petition may or may not be filed where
diversion services have been terminated because the parent or other
person legally responsible for the child failed to consent to the
diversion plan or failed to actively participate in the services
provided.
G. Diversion services shall include, but not be limited to,
Functional Family Therapy, first-time offender programs, community-
at-risk services, or other similar programs.
H. The Office of Juvenile Affairs shall evaluate the rate of
recidivism for children who are offered diversion services and shall
publish the rate publicly in the Office’s annual report. Data
disclosed in the annual report shall be unidentifiable to an
individual.
SECTION 7. AMENDATORY 30 O.S. 2021, Section 2-101, is
amended to read as follows:
Section 2-101. A. The court of each county, when it appears
necessary or convenient, may appoint guardians for the persons and
estates, or either, or both of them, of minors. When appointing
guardians, preference shall be given to relatives and persons who
have a kinship relationship with the minor.
B. Such appointment may be made on the verified petition of a
relative or other person in behalf of such minor.
C. 1. Before making the appointment, the court may receive an
investigation and report regarding the background and home of the
prospective guardian. The investigation and report of the
prospective guardian and placement restrictions and requirements
shall be made pursuant to the requirements of the Oklahoma Adoption
Code. In determining whether to require a home study pursuant to
the provisions of this paragraph, the court shall balance the need
for a home study to protect the best interests of the minor with the
ability of the prospective guardian to pay for the home study.
2. a. Costs of the home study shall be assessed against any
private child-placing agency having custody of the
ENR. H. B. NO. 1965 Page 38

child, or the person having legal custody of the child
or the prospective guardians of the child.
b. (1) For any child in the custody of the Department of
Human Services or the Department of Juvenile
Justice Office of Juvenile Affairs, the
applicable Department shall conduct or provide
for the home study for such child as required by
the Oklahoma Children’s Code or the Oklahoma
Juvenile Code.
(2) The Department of Human Services or the
Department of Juvenile Justice Office of Juvenile
Affairs shall not be required by any court to
conduct or provide for a home study and report to
the court on guardianship placements for any
child that is not in the custody of either
Department.
3. An order appointing a guardian of the minor who has a parent
living or other person legally responsible for the child shall
comply with the provisions of Section 2-108 of this title.
4. Except in the case of an emergency guardianship placement,
the court shall receive a background check for a prospective
guardian and all other household members eighteen (18) years of age
and older, consisting of a review of a national fingerprint-based
criminal background check or an Oklahoma State Bureau of
Investigation name-based criminal history background check, a search
of the Department of Corrections’ files maintained pursuant to the
Sex Offenders Registration Act, and a search of the child abuse and
neglect information system (CANIS) maintained for review by
authorized entities by the Department of Human Services. The
Department may charge a fee not to exceed Thirty-five Dollars
($35.00) for each search performed pursuant to this paragraph. In
the case of an emergency placement, the court may waive the
requirement for a CANIS search if it cannot be obtained in a
reasonable time and the court determines that it is in the minor’s
best interest that the CANIS search be waived.
D. In addition, before making the appointment, the court must
cause notice of the hearing on the petition for appointment of a
guardian for a minor to be given in the form required by the court
to the minor if the minor has attained the age of fourteen (14) as
ENR. H. B. NO. 1965 Page 39

of the date the petition is filed. The court shall also cause
notice to be sent to the following persons:
1. The then-living parents of the minor and any other person
having custody of the minor, if such parent or person is not one of
the petitioners;
2. If the minor has no then-living parent, then to one of the
then-living grandparents who is not one of the petitioners and who
is not married to one of the petitioners; and
3. If there is no such then-living grandparent or if there is
no such then-living grandparent whose address is known to the
petitioner, then notice shall be given to an adult relative, if any,
of the minor residing in the county in which the petition was filed.
E. Such notice shall be mailed to each person entitled to
notice pursuant to this section, at that person’s address as last-
known to the petitioner, at least ten (10) days prior to the date
set by the court for hearing on the petition. Provided, the court
may direct a shorter notice period if the court deems such shorter
notice period to be appropriate under the circumstances. If there
is no person other than the minor who is entitled to notice, or if
the address of any person, other than the minor, who is entitled to
notice is not known to the petitioner, the petition shall so allege.
The court may direct that notice, other than notice to the minor if
the minor has attained the age of fourteen (14), be waived or be
given to any person or persons other than the minor in such manner
as the court determines and directs.
SECTION 8. This act shall become effective November 1, 2025.
