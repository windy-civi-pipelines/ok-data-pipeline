22 initial deprived child;
23 15. A finding that there exists a substantial erosion of the
24 relationship between the parent and child caused at least in part by
Req. No. 10848 Page 55
1 the parent's serious or aggravated neglect of the child, physical or
2 sexual abuse or exploitation of the child, a prolonged and
3 unreasonable absence of the parent from the child or an unreasonable
4 failure by the parent to visit or communicate in a meaningful way
5 with the child;
6 16. A finding that a child four (4) years of age or older at
7 the time of placement has been placed in foster care by the
8 Department of Human Services for fifteen (15) of the most recent
9 twenty-two (22) months preceding the filing of the petition or
10 motion for termination of parental rights and the child cannot, at
11 the time of the filing of the petition or motion, be safely returned

19 corrected the circumstances which led the child to be adjudicated to
20 be a deprived child, unless:
21 a. a parent has made substantial progress toward
22 eliminating the problem that caused the child's
23 placement in foster care, it is likely that the child
24 will be able to safely return to the parent's home

1 within three (3) months, and the child's return to the
2 parent's home will be in the child's best interests,

4 parent and a permanent plan that does not include
5 termination of parental rights will provide the most
6 secure and appropriate placement for the child,

8 firmly opposed to termination of parental rights, and
9 is likely to disrupt an attempt to place the child
10 with an adoptive family,

12 want parental rights to be terminated, and has
13 designated a guardian for the child,
14 e. the child is not capable of functioning if placed in a
15 family setting. In such a case, the court shall
16 reevaluate the status of the child every ninety (90)
17 days unless there is a final court determination that
18 the child cannot be placed in a family setting,
19 f. the child is an unaccompanied, refugee minor and the
20 case involves international legal issues or compelling

24 court-ordered residential substance abuse treatment
Req. No. 10848 Page 57
1 program constitutes the primary factor in the child's
2 placement in substitute care and termination of
3 parental rights is not in the child's best interest,

10 j. the court may also consider:
11 (1) circumstances of the failure of the parent to
12 develop and maintain a parental bond with the
13 child in a meaningful, supportive manner, and
14 (2) whether allowing the parent to have custody would
15 likely cause the child actual serious
16 psychological harm or harm in the near future as

18 substitute caregiver due to the existence of a
19 strong and positive bond between the child and
20 caregiver; and
21 17. A finding that a child younger than four (4) years of age
22 at the time of placement has been placed in foster care by the

17 a result of the removal of the child from the
18 substitute caregiver due to the existence of a
19 strong, positive bond between the child and
20 caregiver.
21 C. An order directing the termination of parental rights is a
22 final appealable order.

9 those employed by juvenile bureaus, and shall be instruments
10 specifically prescribed by the Office of Juvenile Affairs.
11 C. Upon review of any information presented in the preliminary
12 inquiry, the district attorney may consult with the intake worker to

14 best served by the dismissal of the complaint, the informal
15 adjustment of the complaint, or the filing of a petition.
16 D. Informal If a child is charged with a delinquent act as a
17 result of an offense which would be a misdemeanor if committed by an
18 adult, informal adjustment shall be provided to the child, pursuant
19 to the guidelines in subsection E of this section. If a child is
20 charged with a delinquent act as a result of an offense which would
21 be a felony if committed by an adult, informal adjustment may be
22 provided to the child, pursuant to the guidelines in subsection E of
23 this section, by the intake worker only where the facts reasonably
24 appear to establish prima facie jurisdiction and are admitted and
Req. No. 10848 Page 61
1 wher e consent is obtained from the district attorney, the parent of
2 the child, legal guardian, legal custodian, or legal counsel, if
3 any, and the child.
4 E. The informal adjustment is an agreement whereby the child

15 offense;
16 4. Not be used as evidence against the child at any
17 adjudication hearing;
18 5. Be executed in writing and expressed in language
19 understandable to the persons involved; and

14 provided through public or private agencies.
15 If the intake worker has reasonable cause to believe that the child
16 has failed to carry out the terms of the adjustment agreement or has
17 committed a subsequent offense, in lieu of revoking the agreement,
18 the intake worker may modify the terms of the agreement and extend
19 the period of the agreement for an additional six (6) months from
20 the date on which the modification was made with the consent of the
21 child or counsel of the child, if any.
22 F. G. If an informal adjustment is agreed to pursuant to
23 subsection D of this section, the informal adjustment agreement may
24 require the child to pay a fee equal to no more than what the court
Req. No. 10848 Page 63
1 cost s would have been had a petition been filed. The child shall

5 of the county in which the juvenile bureau is located to be
6 designated the "Juvenile Deferral Fee Revolving Fund" and shall be
7 used by the juvenile bureau to defray costs for the operation of the

20 be a deprived child, unless:

8 firmly opposed to termination of parental rights, and
9 is likely to disrupt an attempt to place the child
10 with an adoptive family,

12 want parental rights to be terminated, and has

15 family setting. In such a case, the court shall
16 reevaluate the status of the child every ninety (90)
17 days unless there is a final court determination that

19 f. the child is an unaccompanied, refugee minor and the

1 program constitutes the primary factor in the child's
2 placement in substitute care and termination of
3 parental rights is not in the child's best interest,
