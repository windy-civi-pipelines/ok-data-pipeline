21 13. A finding that all of the following exist:
22 a. the parent has a diagnosed cognitive disorder, an
23 extreme physical incapacity, or a medical condition,
24 including behavioral health, which renders the parent
Req. No. 2080 Page 47

1 incapable of adequately and appropriately exercising
2 parental rights, duties, and responsibilities within a
3 reasonable time considering the age of the child, and
4 b. allowing the parent to have custody would cause the
5 child actual harm or harm in the near future.
6 A parent’s refusal or pattern of noncompliance with treatment,
7 therapy, medication, or assistance from outside the home can be used
8 as evidence that the parent is incapable of adequately and
9 appropriately exercising parental rights, duties, and
10 responsibilities.
11 A finding that a parent has a diagnosed cognitive disorder, an
12 extreme physical incapacity, or a medical condition, including
13 behavioral health or substance dependency, shall not in and of
14 itself deprive the parent of parental rights;
15 14. A finding that:

17 has been the subject of a previous deprived
18 adjudication of this child or a sibling of this child,
19 and
20 b. the parent has been given an opportunity to correct
21 the conditions which led to the determination of the
22 initial deprived child;
23 15. A finding that there exists a substantial erosion of the
24 relationship between the parent and child caused at least in part by
Req. No. 2080 Page 48

1 the parent’s serious or aggravated neglect of the child, physical or
2 sexual abuse or exploitation of the child, a prolonged and
3 unreasonable absence of the parent from the child or an unreasonable
4 failure by the parent to visit or communicate in a meaningful way
5 with the child;
6 16. A finding that a child four (4) years of age or older at
7 the time of placement has been placed in foster care by the
8 Department of Human Services for fifteen (15) of the most recent
9 twenty-two (22) months preceding the filing of the petition or
10 motion for termination of parental rights and the child cannot, at
11 the time of the filing of the petition or motion, be safely returned
12 to the home of the parent. For purposes of this paragraph, a child
13 shall be considered to have entered foster care on the earlier of:
14 a. the adjudication date, or
15 b. the date that is sixty (60) days after the date on
16 which the child is removed from the home
17 has been in foster care for not less than fifteen (15) months of the
18 most recent twenty-two (22) months and that the parent has not
19 corrected the circumstances which led the child to be adjudicated to
20 be a deprived child, unless:
21 a. a parent has made substantial progress toward
22 eliminating the problem that caused the child’s
23 placement in foster care, it is likely that the child
24 will be able to safely return to the parent’s home
Req. No. 2080 Page 49

1 within ninety (90) days, and the child’s return to the
2 parent’s home will be in the child’s best interests,
3 b. the child has a close and positive relationship with a
4 parent and a permanent plan that does not include
5 termination of parental rights will provide the most
6 secure and appropriate placement for the child,
7 c. the child is twelve (12) years of age or older, is
8 firmly opposed to termination of parental rights, and
9 is likely to disrupt an attempt to place the child
10 with an adoptive family,
11 d. a parent is terminally ill but in remission, does not
12 want parental rights to be terminated, and has
13 designated a guardian for the child,
14 e. the child is not capable of functioning if placed in a
15 family setting. In such a case, the court shall
16 reevaluate the status of the child every ninety (90)
17 days unless there is a court determination that the
18 child cannot be placed in a family setting,
19 f. the child is an unaccompanied, refugee minor and the
20 case involves international legal issues or compelling
21 foreign policy issues,
22 g. adoption is not an appropriate plan for the child,
23 h. the parent’s incarceration constitutes the primary
24 factor in the child’s placement in substitute care and
Req. No. 2080 Page 50

1 termination of parental rights is not in the child’s
2 best interest, or
3 i. the parent’s participation in a court-ordered
4 residential substance abuse treatment program
5 constitutes the primary factor in the child’s
6 placement in substitute care and termination of
7 parental rights is not in the child’s best interest.
8 For purposes of this paragraph, a child shall be considered to
9 have entered foster care on the earlier of the adjudication date, or
10 the date that is sixty (60) days after the date on which the child
11 is removed from the home.
12 The court may also consider circumstances of the failure of the
13 parent to develop and maintain a parental bond with the child in a
14 meaningful, supportive manner, and whether allowing the parent to
15 have custody would likely cause the child actual serious
16 psychological harm or harm in the near future as a result of the
17 removal of the child from the substitute caregiver due to the
18 existence of a strong and positive bond between the child and
19 caregiver; and
20 17. A finding that a child younger than four (4) years of age
21 at the time of placement has been placed in foster care by the
22 Department of Human Services for at least six (6) of the twelve (12)
23 months preceding the filing of the petition or motion for
24
Req. No. 2080 Page 51

1 term ination of parental rights and the child cannot be safely
2 returned to the home of the parent.
3 a. For purposes of this paragraph, a child shall be
4 considered to have entered foster care on the earlier
5 of:
6 (1) the adjudication date, or
7 (2) the date that is sixty (60) days after the date
8 on which the child is removed from the home.
9 b. For purposes of this paragraph, the court may
10 consider:
11 (1) circumstances of the failure of the parent to
12 develop and maintain a parental bond with the
13 child in a meaningful, supportive manner, and
14 (2) whether allowing the parent to have custody would
15 likely cause the child actual serious
16 psychological harm or harm in the near future as
17 a result of the removal of the child from the
18 substitute caregiver due to the existence of a
19 strong, positive bond between the child and
20 caregiver.
21 C. An order directing the termination of parental rights is a
22 final appealable order.
23 D. The provisions of this section shall not apply to adoption
24 proceedings and actions to terminate parental rights which do not
Req. No. 2080 Page 52

1 invo lve a petition for deprived status of the child. Such
2 proceedings and actions shall be governed by the Oklahoma Adoption
3 Code.
4 SECTION 6. AMENDATORY 10A O.S. 2021, Section 2-2-104.1,
5 is amended to read as follows:
6 Section 2-2-104.1. A. Diversion services shall be offered to
7 children who are at risk of being the subject of a child-in-need-of-
8 supervision petition. Diversion services shall be designed to
9 provide an immediate response to families in crisis and to divert
10 children from court proceedings. Diversion services may be provided
11 by outside agencies as designated by the district courts, juvenile
12 bureaus, court employees, or a combination thereof. If a child
13 would be charged with a delinquent act as a result of a first-time
14 offense which would be a misdemeanor if committed by an adult,
15 diversion services shall be provided prior to the district attorney
16 filing a petition alleging the child to be in need of supervision or
17 upon the assumption of custody pursuant to Section 2-2-101 of this
18 title.
19 B. Diversion services shall clearly document diligent attempts
20 to provide appropriate services to the child and the family of the
21 child unless it is determined that there is no substantial
22 likelihood that the child and family of the child will benefit from
23 further diversion attempts.
24
Req. No. 2080 Page 53

1 C. Where the primary issue is truancy, steps taken by the
2 school district to improve the attendance or conduct of the child in
3 school shall be reviewed and attempts to engage the school district
4 in further diversion attempts shall be made if it appears that such
5 attempts will be beneficial to the child.
6 D. Efforts to prevent the filing of the petition may extend
7 until it is determined that there is no substantial likelihood that
8 the child and family of the child will benefit from further
9 attempts. Efforts at diversion may continue after the filing of the
10 petition where it is determined that the child and family of the
11 child will benefit therefrom.
12 E. A child-in-need-of-supervision petition shall not be filed
13 during the period that the designated agency, juvenile bureau, or
14 court employee is providing the diversion services. A finding that
15 the case has been successfully diverted shall constitute presumptive
16 evidence that the underlying allegations have been successfully
17 resolved.
18 F. The designated agency, juvenile bureau, or court employee
19 shall promptly give written notice to the child and family of the
20 child whenever attempts to prevent the filing of the petition have
21 terminated and shall indicate in the notice whether the efforts were
22 successful or whether a child-in-need-of-supervision petition should
23 be filed with the court. A petition may or may not be filed where
24 diversion services have been terminated because the parent or other
Req. No. 2080 Page 54

1 pers on legally responsible for the child failed to consent to the
2 diversion plan or failed to actively participate in the services
3 provided.
4 G. Diversion services shall include, but not be limited to,
5 Functional Family Therapy, first-time offender programs, community-
6 at-risk services, or other similar programs.
7 H. The Office of Juvenile Affairs shall evaluate the rate of
8 recidivism for children who are offered diversion services and shall
9 publish the rate publicly in the Office’s annual report. Data
10 disclosed in the annual report shall be unidentifiable to an
11 individual.
12 SECTION 7. AMENDATORY 30 O.S. 2021, Section 2-101, is
13 amended to read as follows:
14 Section 2-101. A. The court of each county, when it appears
15 necessary or convenient, may appoint guardians for the persons and
16 estates, or either, or both of them, of minors. When appointing
17 guardians, preference shall be given to relatives and persons who
18 have a kinship relationship with the minor.
19 B. Such appointment may be made on the verified petition of a
20 relative or other person in behalf of such minor.
21 C. 1. Before making the appointment, the court may receive an
22 investigation and report regarding the background and home of the
23 prospective guardian. The investigation and report of the
24 prospective guardian and placement restrictions and requirements
Req. No. 2080 Page 55

1 shal l be made pursuant to the requirements of the Oklahoma Adoption
2 Code. In determining whether to require a home study pursuant to
3 the provisions of this paragraph, the court shall balance the need
4 for a home study to protect the best interests of the minor with the
5 ability of the prospective guardian to pay for the home study.
6 2. a. Costs of the home study shall be assessed against any
7 private child-placing agency having custody of the
8 child, or the person having legal custody of the child
9 or the prospective guardians of the child.
10 b. (1) For any child in the custody of the Department of
11 Human Services or the Department of Juvenile
12 Justice Office of Juvenile Affairs, the
13 applicable Department shall conduct or provide
14 for the home study for such child as required by
15 the Oklahoma Children’s Code or the Oklahoma
16 Juvenile Code.
17 (2) The Department of Human Services or the
18 Department of Juvenile Justice Office of Juvenile
19 Affairs shall not be required by any court to
20 conduct or provide for a home study and report to
21 the court on guardianship placements for any
22 child that is not in the custody of either
23 Department.
24
Req. No. 2080 Page 56

1 3. An order appointing a guardian of the minor who has a parent
2 living or other person legally responsible for the child shall
3 comply with the provisions of Section 2-108 of this title.
4 4. Except in the case of an emergency guardianship placement,
5 the court shall receive a background check for a prospective
6 guardian and all other household members eighteen (18) years of age
7 and older, consisting of a review of a national fingerprint-based
8 criminal background check or an Oklahoma State Bureau of
9 Investigation name-based criminal history background check, a search
10 of the Department of Corrections’ files maintained pursuant to the
11 Sex Offenders Registration Act, and a search of the child abuse and
12 neglect information system (CANIS) maintained for review by
13 authorized entities by the Department of Human Services. The
14 Department may charge a fee not to exceed Thirty-five Dollars
15 ($35.00) for each search performed pursuant to this paragraph. In
16 the case of an emergency placement, the court may waive the
17 requirement for a CANIS search if it cannot be obtained in a
18 reasonable time and the court determines that it is in the minor’s
19 best interest that the CANIS search be waived.
20 D. In addition, before making the appointment, the court must
21 cause notice of the hearing on the petition for appointment of a
22 guardian for a minor to be given in the form required by the court
23 to the minor if the minor has attained the age of fourteen (14) as
24
Req. No. 2080 Page 57

1 of t he date the petition is filed. The court shall also cause
2 notice to be sent to the following persons:
3 1. The then-living parents of the minor and any other person
4 having custody of the minor, if such parent or person is not one of
5 the petitioners;
6 2. If the minor has no then-living parent, then to one of the
7 then-living grandparents who is not one of the petitioners and who
8 is not married to one of the petitioners; and
9 3. If there is no such then-living grandparent or if there is
10 no such then-living grandparent whose address is known to the
11 petitioner, then notice shall be given to an adult relative, if any,
12 of the minor residing in the county in which the petition was filed.
13 E. Such notice shall be mailed to each person entitled to
14 notice pursuant to this section, at that person’s address as last-
15 known to the petitioner, at least ten (10) days prior to the date
16 set by the court for hearing on the petition. Provided, the court
17 may direct a shorter notice period if the court deems such shorter
18 notice period to be appropriate under the circumstances. If there
19 is no person other than the minor who is entitled to notice, or if
20 the address of any person, other than the minor, who is entitled to
21 notice is not known to the petitioner, the petition shall so allege.
22 The court may direct that notice, other than notice to the minor if
23 the minor has attained the age of fourteen (14), be waived or be
24
Req. No. 2080 Page 58

1 give n to any person or persons other than the minor in such manner
2 as the court determines and directs.
3 SECTION 8. This act shall become effective November 1, 2025.
