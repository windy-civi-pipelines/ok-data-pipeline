SENATE FLOOR VERSION - HB1965 SFLR Page 46
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)

1 12. A finding that the parent whose rights are sought to be
2 terminated is incarcerated, and the continuation of parental rights
3 would result in harm to the child based on consideration of the
4 following factors, among others:
5 a. the duration of incarceration and its detrimental
6 effect on the parent/child relationship,
7 b. any previous convictions resulting in involuntary
8 confinement in a secure facility,

21 13. A finding that all of the following exist:
22 a. the parent has a diagnosed cognitive disorder, an

SENATE FLOOR VERSION - HB1965 SFLR Page 47
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)

1 incapable of adequately and appropriately exercising
2 parental rights, duties, and responsibilities within a
3 reasonable time considering the age of the child, and
4 b. allowing the parent to have custody would cause the
5 child actual harm or harm in the near future.
6 A parent's refusal or pattern of noncompliance with treatment,
7 therapy, medication, or assistance from outside the home can be used
8 as evidence that the parent is incapable of adequately and
9 appropriately exercising parental rights, duties, and
10 responsibilities.
11 A finding that a parent has a diagnosed cognitive disorder, an
12 extreme physical incapacity, or a medical condition, including
13 behavioral health or substance dependency, shall not in and of

18 adjudication of this child or a sibling of this child,
19 and
20 b. the parent has been given an opportunity to correct

22 initial deprived child;
23 15. A finding that there exists a substantial erosion of the

SENATE FLOOR VERSION - HB1965 SFLR Page 48
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)

1 the parent's serious or aggravated neglect of the child, physical or
2 sexual abuse or exploitation of the child, a prolonged and
3 unreasonable absence of the parent from the child or an unreasonable
4 failure by the parent to visit or communicate in a meaningful way
5 with the child;
6 16. A finding that a child four (4) years of age or older at
7 the time of placement has been placed in foster care by the
8 Department of Human Services for fifteen (15) of the most recent
9 twenty-two (22) months preceding the filing of the petition or
10 motion for termination of parental rights and the child cannot, at
11 the time of the filing of the petition or motion, be safely returned
12 to the home of the parent. For purposes of this paragraph, a child
13 shall be considered to have entered foster care on the earlier of:
14 a. the adjudication date, or
15 b. the date that is sixty (60) days after the date on
16 which the child is removed from the home
17 has been in foster care for not less than fifteen (15) months of the
18 most recent twenty-two (22) months and that the parent has not
19 corrected the circumstances which led the child to be adjudicated to
20 be a deprived child, unless:
21 a. a parent has made substantial progress toward
22 eliminating the problem that caused the child's
23 placement in foster care, it is likely that the child
24 will be able to safely return to the parent's home
SENATE FLOOR VERSION - HB1965 SFLR Page 49
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)

1 within ninety (90) days, and the child's return to the
2 parent's home will be in the child's best interests,
3 b. the child has a close and positive relationship with a
4 parent and a permanent plan that does not include
5 termination of parental rights will provide the most
6 secure and appropriate placement for the child,
7 c. the child is fourteen (14) years of age or older, is
8 firmly opposed to termination of parental rights, and
9 is likely to disrupt an attempt to place the child
10 with an adoptive family,
11 d. a parent is terminally ill but in remission, does not
12 want parental rights to be terminated, and has
13 designated a guardian for the child,
14 e. the child is not capable of functioning if placed in a
15 family setting. In such a case, the court shall
16 reevaluate the status of the child every ninety (90)
17 days unless there is a court determination that the
18 child cannot be placed in a family setting,
19 f. the child is an unaccompanied, refugee minor and the
20 case involves international legal issues or compelling
21 foreign policy issues,
22 g. adoption is not an appropriate plan for the child,
23 h. the parent's incarceration constitutes the primary
24 factor in the child's placement in substitute care and
SENATE FLOOR VERSION - HB1965 SFLR Page 50
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)

1 termination of parental rights is not in the child's
2 best interest,
3 i. the parent's participation in a court-ordered
4 residential substance abuse treatment program
5 constitutes the primary factor in the child's
6 placement in substitute care and termination of
7 parental rights is not in the child's best interest.
8 For purposes of this paragraph, a child shall be considered to
9 have entered foster care on the earlier of the adjudication date, or
10 the date that is sixty (60) days after the date on which the child
11 is removed from the home.
12 The court may also consider circumstances of the failure of the
13 parent to develop and maintain a parental bond with the child in a
14 meaningful, supportive manner, and whether allowing the parent to
15 have custody would likely cause the child actual serious
16 psychological harm or harm in the near future as a result of the
17 removal of the child from the substitute caregiver due to the
18 existence of a strong and positive bond between the child and
19 caregiver; and
20 17. A finding that a child younger than four (4) years of age
21 at the time of placement has been placed in foster care by the
22 Department of Human Services for at least six (6) of the twelve (12)
23 months preceding the filing of the petition or motion for
24
SENATE FLOOR VERSION - HB1965 SFLR Page 51
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)

1 term ination of parental rights and the child cannot be safely
2 returned to the home of the parent.
3 a. For purposes of this paragraph, a child shall be
4 considered to have entered foster care on the earlier
5 of:
6 (1) the adjudication date, or
7 (2) the date that is sixty (60) days after the date
8 on which the child is removed from the home.
9 b. For purposes of this paragraph, the court may
10 consider:
11 (1) circumstances of the failure of the parent to
12 develop and maintain a parental bond with the
13 child in a meaningful, supportive manner, and
14 (2) whether allowing the parent to have custody would
15 likely cause the child actual serious
16 psychological harm or harm in the near future as
17 a result of the removal of the child from the
18 substitute caregiver due to the existence of a
19 strong, positive bond between the child and
20 caregiver.
21 C. An order directing the termination of parental rights is a
22 final appealable order.
23 D. The provisions of this section shall not apply to adoption
24 proceedings and actions to terminate parental rights which do not
SENATE FLOOR VERSION - HB1965 SFLR Page 52
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)

1 invo lve a petition for deprived status of the child. Such
2 proceedings and actions shall be governed by the Oklahoma Adoption
3 Code.
4 SECTION 6. AMENDATORY 10A O.S. 2021, Section 2-2-104, is
5 amended to read as follows:
6 Section 2-2-104. A. A preliminary inquiry shall be conducted
7 to determine whether the interests of the public or of the child who
8 is within the purview of the Oklahoma Juvenile Code require that
9 further court action be taken. If it is determined by the
10 preliminary inquiry that no further action be taken and if agreed to
11 by the district attorney, the intake worker may make such informal
12 adjustment without a petition.
13 B. In the course of the preliminary inquiry, the intake worker
14 shall:
15 1. Hold conferences with the child and the parents, guardian or
16 custodian of the child for the purpose of discussing the disposition
17 of the referral made;
18 2. Interview such persons as necessary to determine whether the
19 filing of a petition would be in the best interests of the child and
20 the community;
21 3. Check existing records of any district court or tribal
22 court, law enforcement agencies, Office of Juvenile Affairs, and
23 Department of Human Services;
24
SENATE FLOOR VERSION - HB1965 SFLR Page 53

1 4. Obtain existing mental health, medical and educational
2 records of the child with the consent of the parents, guardian or
3 custodian of the child or by court order; and
4 5. Administer any screening and assessment instruments or refer
5 for necessary screening and assessments to assist in the
6 determination of any immediate needs of the child as well as the
7 immediate risks to the community. All screening and assessment
8 instruments shall be uniformly used by all intake workers, including
9 those employed by juvenile bureaus, and shall be instruments
10 specifically prescribed by the Office of Juvenile Affairs.
11 C. Upon review of any information presented in the preliminary
12 inquiry, the district attorney may consult with the intake worker to
13 determine whether the interests of the child and the public will be
14 best served by the dismissal of the complaint, the informal
15 adjustment of the complaint, or the filing of a petition.
16 D. Informal adjustment may be provided to the child If a child
17 is charged with a delinquent act as a result of a first-time,
18 nonviolent offense which would be a misdemeanor if committed by an
19 adult, an informal adjustment shall be considered for the child,
20 pursuant to the guidelines in subsection E of this section, by the
21 intake worker only where the facts reasonably appear to establish
22 prima facie jurisdiction and are admitted and where consent is
23 obtained from the district attorney, the parent of the child, legal
24 guardian, legal custodian, or legal counsel, if any, and the child.
SENATE FLOOR VERSION - HB1965 SFLR Page 54
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)

1 E. The informal adjustment is an agreement whereby the child
2 agrees to fulfill certain conditions in exchange for not having a
3 petition filed against the child. The informal adjustment shall be
4 completed within a period of time not to exceed six (6) months and
5 shall:
6 1. Be voluntarily entered into by all parties;
7 2. Be revocable by the child at any time by a written
8 revocation;
9 3. Be revocable by the intake worker in the event there is
10 reasonable cause to believe the child has failed to carry out the
11 terms of the informal adjustment or has committed a subsequent
12 offense;
13 4. Not be used as evidence against the child at any
14 adjudication hearing;
15 5. Be executed in writing and expressed in language
16 understandable to the persons involved; and
17 6. Become part of the juvenile record of the child.
18 E. F. The informal adjustment agreement under this section may
19 include, among other suitable methods, programs and procedures, the
20 following:
21 1. Participation in or referral to counseling, a period of
22 community service, drug or alcohol education or treatment,
23 vocational training or any other legal activity which in the opinion
24
SENATE FLOOR VERSION - HB1965 SFLR Page 55
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)

1 of t he intake officer would be beneficial to the child and family of
2 the child;
3 2. Require the child to undergo a behavioral health evaluation
4 and, if warranted, undergo appropriate care or treatment;
5 3. Restitution providing for monetary payment by the parents or
6 child to the victim who was physically injured or who suffered loss
7 of or damage to property as a result of the conduct alleged. Before
8 setting the amount of restitution, the intake officer shall consult
9 with the victim concerning the amount of damages; or
10 4. Informal adjustment projects, programs and services may be
11 provided through public or private agencies.
12 If the intake worker has reasonable cause to believe that the child
13 has failed to carry out the terms of the adjustment agreement or has
14 committed a subsequent offense, in lieu of revoking the agreement,
15 the intake worker may modify the terms of the agreement and extend
16 the period of the agreement for an additional six (6) months from
17 the date on which the modification was made with the consent of the
18 child or counsel of the child, if any.
19 F. G. If an informal adjustment is agreed to pursuant to
20 subsection D of this section, the informal adjustment agreement may
21 require the child to pay a fee equal to no more than what the court
22 costs would have been had a petition been filed. The child shall
23 remit the fee directly to the agency responsible for the monitoring
24 and supervision of the child. If the supervising agency is a
SENATE FLOOR VERSION - HB1965 SFLR Page 56
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)

1 juve nile bureau, then the fee shall be remitted to a revolving fund
2 of the county in which the juvenile bureau is located to be
3 designated the "Juvenile Deferral Fee Revolving Fund" and shall be
4 used by the juvenile bureau to defray costs for the operation of the
5 juvenile bureau. In those counties without juvenile bureaus and in
6 which the Office of Juvenile Affairs or one of their contracting
7 agencies provides the monitoring and supervision of the juvenile,
8 the fee shall be paid directly to the Office of Juvenile Affairs and
9 shall be used to defray the costs for the operation of the Office of
10 Juvenile Affairs.
11 H. The Office of Juvenile Affairs shall conduct an assessment
12 for any child who successfully completes an informal adjustment
13 utilizing program evaluations and data collection. The collected
14 data may include, but shall not be limited to:
15 1. Recidivism;
16 2. School engagement;
17 3. Social engagement; and
18 4. Graduation rates.
19 SECTION 7. This act shall become effective November 1, 2025.
