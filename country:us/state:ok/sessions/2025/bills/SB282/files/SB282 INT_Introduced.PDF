BE IT ENACTED BY THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF OKLAHOMA:
22
23
SECTION 1. NEW LAW A new section of law not to be
23
24
codified in the Oklahoma Statutes reads as follows:
24
Req. No. 1461 Page 1

1
This act shall be known and may be cited as the “Budget
1
2
Accountability for State’s Economic Defense (BASED) Act”.
2
3
SECTION 2. NEW LAW A new section of law not to be
3
4
codified in the Oklahoma Statutes reads as follows:
4
5
A. The Legislature hereby finds:
5
6
1. State sovereignty and constitutional duty: The tenth
6
7
amendment to the United States Constitution reserves to the states
7
8
all powers not delegated to the federal government. Oklahoma has
8
9
both the constitutional authority and the fiduciary duty to protect
9
10
its citizens from economic harm caused by federal fiscal
10
11
mismanagement;
11
12
2. The failure of Congress to promote the general welfare:
12
13
Section 8 of Article I of the United States Constitution grants
13
14
Congress the power to tax to provide for the common defense and
14
15
general welfare. However, Congress’s continued failure to enact a
15
16
balanced federal budget has resulted in a national debt exceeding
16
17
Thirty-six Trillion Dollars ($36,000,000,000,000.00), or more than
17
18
One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000.00) per U.S. citizen, which
18
19
creates an existential threat to the general welfare. Congress’s
19
20
failure to fulfill its constitutional duty renders its exercise of
20
21
taxing power unconstitutional in effect, as funding such
21
22
irresponsible deficits, which, if allowed to continue, will
22
23
necessarily lead to financial ruin for American citizens, and
23
24
clearly undermines, and does not promote, the general welfare. In
24
Req. No. 1461 Page 2

1
United States v. Butler (1936), the Supreme Court held that
1
2
Congress’s taxing power must align with promoting the general
2
3
welfare. Funding an unbalanced budget violates this principle;
3
4
3. Existential threat to national defense: Continuing to run
4
5
deficits while the national debt already exceeds Thirty-six Trillion
5
6
Dollars ($36,000,000,000,000.00) compromises America’s ability to
6
7
provide for the nation’s common defense by:
7
8
a. weakening the nation’s economic stability and
8
9
eventually leading to economic ruin and the inability
9
10
to adequately fund the U.S. military, and
10
11
b. undermining its capacity to respond to national
11
12
emergencies and foreign threats.
12
13
The federal government’s fiscal recklessness jeopardizes the
13
14
very foundations of national security and economic health;
14
15
4. Fiduciary responsibility and the public trust doctrine:
15
16
Congress, under Section 8 of Article I of the United States
16
17
Constitution, holds a fiduciary duty to tax and spend for the
17
18
benefit of the American people. Decades of deficits and ballooning
18
19
debt represent a breach of this public trust, imposing undue
19
20
financial burdens on the citizens and states. Under the Public
20
21
Trust Doctrine, when a fiduciary fails to act in a way that could be
21
22
reasonably characterized as responsible, beneficiaries, or in this
22
23
case the states, have the right and obligation to intervene to
23
24
ensure proper use of resources. Oklahoma, as a sovereign state,
24
Req. No. 1461 Page 3

1
must shield its citizens from participation in this irresponsible
1
2
and unconstitutional fiscal system;
2
3
5. This state’s obligation to protect property rights: Section
3
4
2 of Article II of the Oklahoma Constitution states, “All persons
4
5
have the inherent right to life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness,
5
6
and the enjoyment of the gains of their own industry”. The
6
7
devaluation of citizens’ labor and property through inflation and
7
8
unbalanced federal spending undermines this fundamental right.
8
9
Oklahoma has an obligation to protect its citizens’ income and
9
10
wealth from the economic harm currently being inflicted and the
10
11
unimaginable harm to come if the federal deficit continues to grow;
11
12
6. Emergency doctrine and state intervention: The current
12
13
fiscal crisis, including decades of unbalanced budgets and
13
14
unsustainable debt, constitutes an economic and national emergency.
14
15
Under the emergency doctrine, states have the authority to take
15
16
extraordinary measures to preserve the welfare of their citizens.
16
17
In Home Building & Loan Association v. Blaisdell (1934), the Supreme
17
18
Court upheld state actions during emergencies to protect the public
18
19
welfare. This state asserts that the withholding of federal taxes
19
20
until Congress enacts a balanced budget is a temporary and necessary
20
21
action to avert economic catastrophe caused by willful fiscal
21
22
negligence;
22
23
7. Temporary, defensive, and constructive action: The Taxpayer
23
24
Protection Escrow Fund is a temporary, non-violent assertion of the
24
Req. No. 1461 Page 4

1
sovereign duty of this state to protect its citizens. It does not
1
2
seek to nullify federal law but, instead, establishes conditions for
2
3
compliance based on constitutional principles. The action of this
3
4
state is:
4
5
a. temporary - withholding continues until Congress
5
6
enacts a balanced budget,
6
7
b. defensive - shielding the citizens of this state from
7
8
economic harm caused by federal fiscal
8
9
irresponsibility, and
9
10
c. constructive - encouraging Congress to restore fiscal
10
11
discipline and fulfill its constitutional duty to
11
12
promote the general welfare; and
12
13
8. DOGE proposals are on the table: The Department of
13
14
Government Efficiency is in the process of making proposals to
14
15
reduce federal spending by Two Trillion Dollars
15
16
($2,000,000,000,000.00) which could balance the budget if
16
17
implemented by Congress and voters gave lawmakers a clear mandate to
17
18
do so.
18
19
B. It is the intent of the Legislature to:
19
20
1. Withhold the remittance of federal income taxes collected
20
21
within this state until the United States Congress passes a balanced
21
22
federal budget; and
22
23
2. Protect Oklahoma taxpayers, state employees, agencies,
23
24
businesses, and entities from retaliation by the federal government
24
Req. No. 1461 Page 5

for this state’s lawful assertion of its constitutional duty to
1
2
safeguard citizens.
