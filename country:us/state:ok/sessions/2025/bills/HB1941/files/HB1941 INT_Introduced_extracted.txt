Req. No. 11351 Page 24
1 fisc al year, or portion thereof, out of appropriations made and

3 rental contract extending beyond June 30 of the fiscal year shall be
4 void unless it contains provisions for mutual ratification of
5 renewal pursuant to the conditions provided for in this subsection.
6 It is the intent of this subsection to authorize boards of education
7 to enter into lease contracts but not to incur any obligation
8 against the school district in excess of the income and revenue
9 provided for such purposes for the fiscal year in which the lease
10 contract is operative. Any lease or lease-purchase agreement
11 entered into by any board of education shall state the purchase

23 education renting or leasing the same certifies by proper resolution
24 entered in the minutes of the board of education that the
Req. No. 11351 Page 25
1 cont inuance of the rental is unnecessary and contrary to the public
2 interest. Any lease-purchase agreement entered into shall include
3 the right of a school district to acquire buildings, equipment or
4 other facilities or discrete components thereof or improve school
5 sites through a lease-purchase agreement. A school district may use
6 proceeds derived from the sale of bonds as authorized by Section 26
7 of Article X of the Oklahoma Constitution to make lease-purchase
8 payments, including interest, under a lease-purchase agreement. For
9 purposes of this subsection, the term “acquired” as used in Section
10 26 of Article X of the Oklahoma Constitution shall mean the
11 possession, control, or power to dispose of personal or real
12 property.
13 C. The boards of education of two or more school districts may
14 enter into cooperative agreements and maintain joint programs
15 including, but not limited to, courses of instruction for
16 handicapped children, courses of instruction in music and other
17 subjects, practical instruction for trades and vocations, practical
18 instruction in driver training courses, and health programs
19 including visual care by persons legally licensed for such purpose,
20 without favoritism as to either profession. The revenues necessary
21 to operate a joint program approved in cooperative agreements,
22 whether from federal, state or local sources, including the
23 individual contributions of participating school districts, shall be
24 deposited into a fund separate from all other appropriated funds.
Req. No. 11351 Page 26
1 The beginning fund balance each year, combined with all actual
2 revenues, including collected and estimated revenues, must be
3 appropriated before being expended. Purchase orders shall be issued
4 against available appropriations and, once goods or services have
5 been received, either payable or nonpayable warrants shall be issued
6 in payment of all purchase orders. The fund shall be reported as a
7 separate appropriated fund in all the financial reports of the
8 school district which is chosen by the other school districts to
9 keep the accounting records of the joint program.
10 D. The boards of education of two or more school districts may
11 enter into a mutual contract or separate contracts with a
12 superintendent, an administrator, or teacher, or with a person to
13 provide support services, to serve as superintendent, administrator,
14 or teacher, as appropriately qualified, or to provide support
15 services, for each contracting district upon such terms and
16 conditions as the parties may agree. Nothing in this section shall
17 be construed to authorize or require annexation or consolidation of
18 any school districts or the closing of any school site except
19 pursuant to law as set forth in Section 7-101 et seq. of this title
20 or any succeeding statutes.
21 E. Any school district may operate or maintain a school or
22 schools on any military reservation which is within the boundaries
23 of the school district or which is adjacent to the school district,
24 and provide the instruction in the school or schools to children of
Req. No. 11351 Page 27
1 pers onnel on the military reservation and, in doing so, shall
2 conform to all federal laws and requirements.
3 F. The board of education of each school district shall adopt
4 and maintain on file in the office of the superintendent of schools
5 appropriate personnel policy and sick leave guide. The guide shall
6 be made available to the public.
7 G. The board of education of any school district with an
8 average daily membership of thirty thousand (30,000) or more and all
9 or part of which school district is located in a county having more
10 than five hundred thousand (500,000) population according to the
11 latest Federal Decennial Census may contract with a public or
12 private nonsectarian entity for that entity to provide educational
13 and administrative services for the school district. The
14 educational services provided by a contracting entity may include
15 but are not limited to the delivery of instructional service in core
16 and noncore academic subjects to the students enrolled in the school
17 district at one or more school sites or parts of sites within the
18 district pursuant to the terms of an educational services contract.
19 All educational service providers and their employees and
20 representatives and all educational and administrative services
21 provided under an educational services contract shall be exempt from
22 all statutes and rules relating to schools, boards of education and
23 school districts to the same extent that a charter school is exempt
24 under the Oklahoma Charter Schools Act. For all purposes including
Req. No. 11351 Page 28
1 but not limited to attendance, funding from all sources and
2 accountability, all students who are provided services by a
3 contracting entity pursuant to an educational services contract
4 shall at all times be and remain students of the school district.

7 is created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:
8 Candidates who win election to the office of superintendent of

10 certified as an administrator as required by Section 1-116 of Title
11 70 of the Oklahoma Statutes or any succeeding statute. The
12 superintendent shall no longer be recognized by the State Board of
13 Education as certified under this section at the end of their tenure
14 in office.
15 SECTION 11. This act shall become effective July 1, 2025.

17 of the public peace, health or safety, an emergency is hereby
18 declared to exist, by reason whereof this act shall take effect and
19 be in full force from and after its passage and approval.

6 It is the intent of this subsection to authorize boards of education
7 to enter into lease contracts but not to incur any obligation
8 against the school district in excess of the income and revenue
9 provided for such purposes for the fiscal year in which the lease
10 contract is operative. Any lease or lease-purchase agreement
11 entered into by any board of education shall state the purchase
12 price of real or personal property so leased. The lease or lease-
13 purchase shall not be extended so as to cause payment of more than

16 interest has been paid, the property shall belong to the lessee and
17 the lessor shall deliver a deed or bill of sale to the property to
18 the lessee. When any real or personal property has been leased or
19 rented during any fiscal year pursuant to the provisions of any
20 contract which permits continuance of the rental for the remainder

23 education renting or leasing the same certifies by proper resolution
24 entered in the minutes of the board of education that the
Req. No. 11351 Page 25

1 cont inuance of the rental is unnecessary and contrary to the public
2 interest. Any lease-purchase agreement entered into shall include
3 the right of a school district to acquire buildings, equipment or
4 other facilities or discrete components thereof or improve school
5 sites through a lease-purchase agreement. A school district may use
6 proceeds derived from the sale of bonds as authorized by Section 26
7 of Article X of the Oklahoma Constitution to make lease-purchase
8 payments, including interest, under a lease-purchase agreement. For
9 purposes of this subsection, the term “acquired” as used in Section
10 26 of Article X of the Oklahoma Constitution shall mean the
11 possession, control, or power to dispose of personal or real
12 property.
13 C. The boards of education of two or more school districts may
14 enter into cooperative agreements and maintain joint programs
15 including, but not limited to, courses of instruction for

17 subjects, practical instruction for trades and vocations, practical
18 instruction in driver training courses, and health programs
19 including visual care by persons legally licensed for such purpose,
20 without favoritism as to either profession. The revenues necessary
21 to operate a joint program approved in cooperative agreements,
22 whether from federal, state or local sources, including the
23 individual contributions of participating school districts, shall be
24 deposited into a fund separate from all other appropriated funds.
Req. No. 11351 Page 26

1 The beginning fund balance each year, combined with all actual
2 revenues, including collected and estimated revenues, must be
3 appropriated before being expended. Purchase orders shall be issued
4 against available appropriations and, once goods or services have
5 been received, either payable or nonpayable warrants shall be issued
6 in payment of all purchase orders. The fund shall be reported as a
7 separate appropriated fund in all the financial reports of the
8 school district which is chosen by the other school districts to
9 keep the accounting records of the joint program.
10 D. The boards of education of two or more school districts may
11 enter into a mutual contract or separate contracts with a
12 superintendent, an administrator, or teacher, or with a person to
13 provide support services, to serve as superintendent, administrator,
14 or teacher, as appropriately qualified, or to provide support
15 services, for each contracting district upon such terms and
16 conditions as the parties may agree. Nothing in this section shall
17 be construed to authorize or require annexation or consolidation of
18 any school districts or the closing of any school site except
19 pursuant to law as set forth in Section 7-101 et seq. of this title
20 or any succeeding statutes.
21 E. Any school district may operate or maintain a school or
22 schools on any military reservation which is within the boundaries
23 of the school district or which is adjacent to the school district,
24 and provide the instruction in the school or schools to children of
Req. No. 11351 Page 27

1 pers onnel on the military reservation and, in doing so, shall
2 conform to all federal laws and requirements.
3 F. The board of education of each school district shall adopt
4 and maintain on file in the office of the superintendent of schools
5 appropriate personnel policy and sick leave guide. The guide shall
6 be made available to the public.

8 average daily membership of thirty thousand (30,000) or more and all
9 or part of which school district is located in a county having more
10 than five hundred thousand (500,000) population according to the
11 latest Federal Decennial Census may contract with a public or
12 private nonsectarian entity for that entity to provide educational
13 and administrative services for the school district. The
14 educational services provided by a contracting entity may include
15 but are not limited to the delivery of instructional service in core
16 and noncore academic subjects to the students enrolled in the school
17 district at one or more school sites or parts of sites within the
18 district pursuant to the terms of an educational services contract.
19 All educational service providers and their employees and
20 representatives and all educational and administrative services
21 provided under an educational services contract shall be exempt from
22 all statutes and rules relating to schools, boards of education and
23 school districts to the same extent that a charter school is exempt
24 under the Oklahoma Charter Schools Act. For all purposes including
Req. No. 11351 Page 28

1 but not limited to attendance, funding from all sources and
2 accountability, all students who are provided services by a
3 contracting entity pursuant to an educational services contract
4 shall at all times be and remain students of the school district.
5 SECTION 10. NEW LAW A new section of law to be codified
6 in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 5-108A of Title 70, unless there
7 is created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:
8 Candidates who win election to the office of superintendent of
9 schools shall be recognized by the State Board of Education as
10 certified as an administrator as required by Section 1-116 of Title
11 70 of the Oklahoma Statutes or any succeeding statute. The
12 superintendent shall no longer be recognized by the State Board of
13 Education as certified under this section at the end of their tenure
14 in office.
15 SECTION 11. This act shall become effective July 1, 2025.
16 SECTION 12. It being immediately necessary for the preservation
17 of the public peace, health or safety, an emergency is hereby
18 declared to exist, by reason whereof this act shall take effect and
19 be in full force from and after its passage and approval.
