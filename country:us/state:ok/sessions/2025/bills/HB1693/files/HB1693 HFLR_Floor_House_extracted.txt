4 1. Of the reason he or she is being executed; and
5 2. That he or she is to be executed and that execution is
6 imminent.
7 B. There shall be a presumption that a person who has received
8 a judgment of death is mentally competent to be executed.
9 C. If, after the Attorney General files a motion to set an
10 execution date, the person's attorney for the person has good reason
11 to believe that the person may be mentally incompetent to be
12 executed, the attorney may file a motion in the Court of Criminal
13 Appeals setting forth the facts giving rise to the belief that the
14 person may be mentally incompetent to be executed and requesting the
15 court to order that the person be examined for mental competency to
16 be executed.
17 D. A motion alleging that a person is mentally incompetent to
18 be executed shall be filed initially when filing a written response
19 to the motion of the Attorney General to set an execution date. The
20 person shall have seven (7) days from the filing of the motion of
21 the Attorney General to file a response and raise the issue of
22 mental incompetency.

6 previous proceeding in which the person challenged his or her

18 Section 1001.1 of Title 22 of the Oklahoma Statutes this title, the
19 Court of Criminal Appeals may issue stays of execution as necessary
20 to permit inquiry into the person's mental competency of the person

9 substantial showing that he or she is mentally incompetent to be
10 executed, the trial court shall order an examination of the person
11 by the Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services or
12 by a qualified forensic examiner designated by the Department of
13 Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services. By filing the motion,
14 the person shall be deemed to consent to submit to an examination as
15 required by this section for the purpose of assessment of mental
16 competency to be executed. In addition, the person waives any claim
17 of privilege with respect to, and consents to the release of, all
18 mental health and medical records relevant to whether the person is
19 mentally incompetent to be executed. If the person refuses to be
20 examined by the state's expert of the state, the trial court shall
