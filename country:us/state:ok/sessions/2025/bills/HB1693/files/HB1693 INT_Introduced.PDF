1 2. That he or she is to be executed and that execution is
2 imminent.
3 B. There shall be a presumption that a person who has received
4 a judgment of death is mentally competent to be executed.
5 C. If, after the Attorney General files a motion to set an
6 execution date, the person's attorney for the person has good reason
7 to believe that the person may be mentally incompetent to be
8 executed, the attorney may file a motion in the Court of Criminal
9 Appeals setting forth the facts giving rise to the belief that the
10 person may be mentally incompetent to be executed and requesting the
11 court to order that the person be examined for mental competency to
12 be executed.
13 D. A motion alleging that a person is mentally incompetent to
14 be executed shall be filed initially when filing a written response
15 to the motion of the Attorney General to set an execution date. The
16 person shall have seven (7) days from the filing of the motion of
17 the Attorney General to file a response and raise the issue of
18 mental incompetency.
19 E. A motion alleging that a person is mentally incompetent to
20 be executed shall identify the proceeding in which the person was

17 not consider any expert evidence offered by the person concerning
18 his or her competency.
19 I. The qualified forensic examiner or examiners shall receive
20 instructions to examine the person to determine whether the person
21 has a rational understanding:
