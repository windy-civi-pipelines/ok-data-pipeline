8 3. The amount of any federal net operating loss deduction shall
9 be adjusted as follows:
10 a. For carryovers and carrybacks to taxable years
11 beginning before January 1, 1981, the amount of any
12 net operating loss deduction allowed to a taxpayer for

17 business or commercial situs apart from the
18 domicile of the taxpayer such income shall be
19 allocated in accordance with such business or
20 commercial situs; interest income from
21 investments held to generate working capital for
22 a unitary business enterprise shall be included
23 in apportionable income; a resident trust or
24 resident estate shall be treated as having a
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2194 Page 4

2 undistributed income is concerned, but shall not
3 be treated as having a separate commercial or
4 business situs insofar as distributed income is
5 concerned,
6 (2) for taxable years beginning after December 31,
7 2003, capital or ordinary gains or losses from
8 the sale of an ownership interest in a publicly
9 traded partnership, as defined by Section 7704(b)
10 of the Internal Revenue Code, shall be allocated
11 to this state in the ratio of the original cost
12 of such partnership's tangible property in this
13 state to the original cost of such partnership's
14 tangible property everywhere, as determined at
15 the time of the sale; if more than fifty percent
16 (50%) of the value of the partnership's assets
17 consists of intangible assets, capital or
18 ordinary gains or losses from the sale of an
19 ownership interest in the partnership shall be
20 allocated to this state in accordance with the
21 sales factor of the partnership for its first
22 full tax period immediately preceding its tax
23 period during which the ownership interest in the
24 partnership was sold; the provisions of this
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2194 Page 5

1 division shall only apply if the capital or
2 ordinary gains or losses from the sale of an
3 ownership interest in a partnership do not
4 constitute qualifying gain receiving capital

17 enterprise the business of which in Oklahoma consists
18 solely of marketing its products by:

4 (3) sales of the product stored in public warehouses
5 within the state where the shipment to such
6 warehouses is not covered by "in transit"
7 tariffs, as prescribed and allowed by the
8 Interstate Commerce Commission, to a purchaser
9 within or without the state,
10 the Oklahoma net income shall, at the option of the
11 taxpayer, be that portion of the total net income of
12 the taxpayer for federal income tax purposes derived
13 from the manufacture and/or processing and sales
14 everywhere as determined by the ratio of the sales
15 defined in this section made to the purchaser within
16 the state to the total sales everywhere. The term
17 "public warehouse" as used in this subparagraph means
18 a licensed public warehouse, the principal business of
19 which is warehousing merchandise for the public;
20 e. In the case of insurance companies, Oklahoma taxable
21 income shall be taxable income of the taxpayer for

ENGR. H. B. NO. 2194 Page 7

1 (1) except as otherwise provided by division (2) of
2 this subparagraph, taxable income of an insurance
3 company for a taxable year shall be apportioned
4 to this state by multiplying such income by a
5 fraction, the numerator of which is the direct
6 premiums written for insurance on property or
7 risks in this state, and the denominator of which
8 is the direct premiums written for insurance on
9 property or risks everywhere. For purposes of
10 this subsection, the term "direct premiums
11 written" means the total amount of direct
12 premiums written, assessments and annuity
13 considerations as reported for the taxable year
14 on the annual statement filed by the company with
15 the Insurance Commissioner in the form approved
16 by the National Association of Insurance
17 Commissioners, or such other form as may be
18 prescribed in lieu thereof,
19 (2) if the principal source of premiums written by an
20 insurance company consists of premiums for
21 reinsurance accepted by it, the taxable income of
22 such company shall be apportioned to this state
23 by multiplying such income by a fraction, the
24 numerator of which is the sum of (a) direct
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2194 Page 8

1 premiums written for insurance on property or
2 risks in this state, plus (b) premiums written
3 for reinsurance accepted in respect of property
4 or risks in this state, and the denominator of
5 which is the sum of (c) direct premiums written
6 for insurance on property or risks everywhere,
7 plus (d) premiums written for reinsurance
8 accepted in respect of property or risks
9 everywhere. For purposes of this paragraph,
10 premiums written for reinsurance accepted in
11 respect of property or risks in this state,
12 whether or not otherwise determinable, may at the
13 election of the company be determined on the
14 basis of the proportion which premiums written
15 for insurance accepted from companies
16 commercially domiciled in Oklahoma bears to
17 premiums written for reinsurance accepted from
18 all sources, or alternatively in the proportion
19 which the sum of the direct premiums written for
20 insurance on property or risks in this state by
21 each ceding company from which reinsurance is
22 accepted bears to the sum of the total direct
23 premiums written by each such ceding company for
24 the taxable year.
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2194 Page 9

1 5. The net income or loss remaining after the separate
2 allocation in paragraph 4 of this subsection, being that which is
3 derived from a unitary business enterprise, shall be apportioned to
4 this state on the basis of the arithmetical average of three factors
5 consisting of property, payroll and sales or gross revenue
6 enumerated as subparagraphs a, b and c of this paragraph. Net
7 income or loss as used in this paragraph includes that derived from
8 patent or copyright royalties, purchase discounts, and interest on
9 accounts receivable relating to or arising from a business activity,
10 the income from which is apportioned pursuant to this subsection,
11 including the sale or other disposition of such property and any
12 other property used in the unitary enterprise. Deductions used in
13 computing such net income or loss shall not include taxes based on
14 or measured by income. Provided, for corporations whose property
15 for purposes of the tax imposed by Section 2355 of this title has an
16 initial investment cost equaling or exceeding Two Hundred Million
17 Dollars ($200,000,000.00) and such investment is made on or after
18 July 1, 1997, or for corporations which expand their property or
19 facilities in this state and such expansion has an investment cost
20 equaling or exceeding Two Hundred Million Dollars ($200,000,000.00)
21 over a period not to exceed three (3) years, and such expansion is
22 commenced on or after January 1, 2000, the three factors shall be
23 apportioned with property and payroll, each comprising twenty-five
24 percent (25%) of the apportionment factor and sales comprising fifty
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2194 Page 10

1 perc ent (50%) of the apportionment factor. The apportionment
2 factors shall be computed as follows:
3 a. The property factor is a fraction, the numerator of
4 which is the average value of the taxpayer's real and
5 tangible personal property owned or rented and used in
6 this state during the tax period and the denominator
7 of which is the average value of all the taxpayer's
8 real and tangible personal property everywhere owned
9 or rented and used during the tax period.
10 (1) Property, the income from which is separately
11 allocated in paragraph 4 of this subsection,
12 shall not be included in determining this
13 fraction. The numerator of the fraction shall
14 include a portion of the investment in
15 transportation and other equipment having no
16 fixed situs, such as rolling stock, buses, trucks
17 and trailers, including machinery and equipment
18 carried thereon, airplanes, salespersons'
19 automobiles and other similar equipment, in the
20 proportion that miles traveled in Oklahoma by
21 such equipment bears to total miles traveled,
22 (2) Property owned by the taxpayer is valued at its
23 original cost. Property rented by the taxpayer
24 is valued at eight times the net annual rental
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2194 Page 11

1 rate. Net annual rental rate is the annual
2 rental rate paid by the taxpayer, less any annual
3 rental rate received by the taxpayer from
4 subrentals,
5 (3) The average value of property shall be determined
6 by averaging the values at the beginning and
7 ending of the tax period but the Oklahoma Tax
8 Commission may require the averaging of monthly
9 values during the tax period if reasonably
10 required to reflect properly the average value of
11 the taxpayer's property;
12 b. The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of
13 which is the total compensation for services rendered
14 in the state during the tax period, and the
15 denominator of which is the total compensation for
16 services rendered everywhere during the tax period.
17 "Compensation", as used in this subsection means those
18 paid-for services to the extent related to the unitary
19 business but does not include officers' salaries,
20 wages and other compensation.
21 (1) In the case of a transportation enterprise, the
22 numerator of the fraction shall include a portion
23 of such expenditure in connection with employees
24 operating equipment over a fixed route, such as
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2194 Page 12

1 railroad employees, airline pilots, or bus
2 drivers, in this state only a part of the time,
3 in the proportion that mileage traveled in
4 Oklahoma bears to total mileage traveled by such
5 employees,
6 (2) In any case the numerator of the fraction shall
7 include a portion of such expenditures in
8 connection with itinerant employees, such as
9 traveling salespersons, in this state only a part
10 of the time, in the proportion that time spent in
11 Oklahoma bears to total time spent in furtherance
12 of the enterprise by such employees;
13 c. The sales factor is a fraction, the numerator of which
14 is the total sales or gross revenue of the taxpayer in
15 this state during the tax period, and the denominator
16 of which is the total sales or gross revenue of the
17 taxpayer everywhere during the tax period. "Sales",
18 as used in this subsection does not include sales or
19 gross revenue which are separately allocated in
20 paragraph 4 of this subsection.
21 (1) Sales of tangible personal property have a situs
22 in this state if the property is delivered or
23 shipped to a purchaser other than the United
24 States government, within this state regardless
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2194 Page 13

1 of the FOB point or other conditions of the sale;
2 or the property is shipped from an office, store,
3 warehouse, factory or other place of storage in
4 this state and (a) the purchaser is the United
5 States government or (b) the taxpayer is not
6 doing business in the state of the destination of
7 the shipment.
8 (2) In the case of a railroad or interurban railway
9 enterprise, the numerator of the fraction shall
10 not be less than the allocation of revenues to
11 this state as shown in its annual report to the
12 Corporation Commission.
13 (3) In the case of an airline, truck or bus
14 enterprise or freight car, tank car, refrigerator
15 car or other railroad equipment enterprise, the
16 numerator of the fraction shall include a portion
17 of revenue from interstate transportation in the
18 proportion that interstate mileage traveled in
19 Oklahoma bears to total interstate mileage
20 traveled.
21 (4) In the case of an oil, gasoline or gas pipeline
22 enterprise, the numerator of the fraction shall
23 be either the total of traffic units of the
24 enterprise within Oklahoma or the revenue
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2194 Page 14

1 allocated to Oklahoma based upon miles moved, at
2 the option of the taxpayer, and the denominator
3 of which shall be the total of traffic units of
4 the enterprise or the revenue of the enterprise
5 everywhere as appropriate to the numerator. A
6 "traffic unit" is hereby defined as the
7 transportation for a distance of one (1) mile of
8 one (1) barrel of oil, one (1) gallon of gasoline
9 or one thousand (1,000) cubic feet of natural or
10 casinghead gas, as the case may be.
11 (5) In the case of a telephone or telegraph or other
12 communication enterprise, the numerator of the
13 fraction shall include that portion of the
14 interstate revenue as is allocated pursuant to
15 the accounting procedures prescribed by the
16 Federal Communications Commission; provided that
17 in respect to each corporation or business entity
18 required by the Federal Communications Commission
19 to keep its books and records in accordance with
20 a uniform system of accounts prescribed by such
21 Commission, the intrastate net income shall be
22 determined separately in the manner provided by
23 such uniform system of accounts and only the
24 interstate income shall be subject to allocation
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2194 Page 15

1 pursuant to the provisions of this subsection.
2 Provided further, that the gross revenue factors
3 shall be those as are determined pursuant to the
4 accounting procedures prescribed by the Federal
5 Communications Commission.
6 In any case where the apportionment of the three factors
7 prescribed in this paragraph attributes to Oklahoma a portion of net
8 income of the enterprise out of all appropriate proportion to the
9 property owned and/or business transacted within this state, because
10 of the fact that one or more of the factors so prescribed are not
11 employed to any appreciable extent in furtherance of the enterprise;
12 or because one or more factors not so prescribed are employed to a
13 considerable extent in furtherance of the enterprise; or because of
14 other reasons, the Tax Commission is empowered to permit, after a
15 showing by taxpayer that an excessive portion of net income has been
16 attributed to Oklahoma, or require, when in its judgment an
17 insufficient portion of net income has been attributed to Oklahoma,
18 the elimination, substitution, or use of additional factors, or
19 reduction or increase in the weight of such prescribed factors.
20 Provided, however, that any such variance from such prescribed
21 factors which has the effect of increasing the portion of net income
22 attributable to Oklahoma must not be inherently arbitrary, and
23 application of the recomputed final apportionment to the net income
24
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2194 Page 16

1 of t he enterprise must attribute to Oklahoma only a reasonable
2 portion thereof.
3 6. For calendar years 1997 and 1998, the owner of a new or
4 expanded agricultural commodity processing facility in this state
5 may exclude from Oklahoma taxable income, or in the case of an
6 individual, the Oklahoma adjusted gross income, fifteen percent
7 (15%) of the investment by the owner in the new or expanded
8 agricultural commodity processing facility. For calendar year 1999,
9 and all subsequent years, the percentage, not to exceed fifteen
10 percent (15%), available to the owner of a new or expanded
11 agricultural commodity processing facility in this state claiming
12 the exemption shall be adjusted annually so that the total estimated
13 reduction in tax liability does not exceed One Million Dollars
14 ($1,000,000.00) annually. The Tax Commission shall promulgate rules
15 for determining the percentage of the investment which each eligible
16 taxpayer may exclude. The exclusion provided by this paragraph
17 shall be taken in the taxable year when the investment is made. In
18 the event the total reduction in tax liability authorized by this
19 paragraph exceeds One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) in any
20 calendar year, the Tax Commission shall permit any excess over One
21 Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) and shall factor such excess into
22 the percentage for subsequent years. Any amount of the exemption
23 permitted to be excluded pursuant to the provisions of this
24 paragraph but not used in any year may be carried forward as an
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2194 Page 17

1 exem ption from income pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph
2 for a period not exceeding six (6) years following the year in which
3 the investment was originally made.
4 For purposes of this paragraph:
5 a. "Agricultural commodity processing facility" means
6 building, structures, fixtures and improvements used
7 or operated primarily for the processing or production
8 of marketable products from agricultural commodities.
9 The term shall also mean a dairy operation that
10 requires a depreciable investment of at least Two
11 Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($250,000.00) and which
12 produces milk from dairy cows. The term does not
13 include a facility that provides only, and nothing
14 more than, storage, cleaning, drying or transportation
15 of agricultural commodities, and
16 b. "Facility" means each part of the facility which is
17 used in a process primarily for:
18 (1) the processing of agricultural commodities,
19 including receiving or storing agricultural
20 commodities, or the production of milk at a dairy
21 operation,
22 (2) transporting the agricultural commodities or
23 product before, during or after the processing,
24 or
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2194 Page 18

1 (3) packaging or otherwise preparing the product for
2 sale or shipment.
3 7. Despite any provision to the contrary in paragraph 3 of this
4 subsection, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1999, in
5 the case of a taxpayer which has a farming loss, such farming loss
6 shall be considered a net operating loss carryback in accordance
7 with and to the extent of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C.,
8 Section 172(b)(G). However, the amount of the net operating loss
9 carryback shall not exceed the lesser of:
10 a. Sixty Thousand Dollars ($60,000.00), or
11 b. the loss properly shown on Schedule F of the Internal
12 Revenue Service Form 1040 reduced by one-half (1/2) of
13 the income from all other sources other than reflected
14 on Schedule F.
15 8. In taxable years beginning after December 31, 1995, all
16 qualified wages equal to the federal income tax credit set forth in
17 26 U.S.C.A., Section 45A, shall be deducted from taxable income.
18 The deduction allowed pursuant to this paragraph shall only be
19 permitted for the tax years in which the federal tax credit pursuant
20 to 26 U.S.C.A., Section 45A, is allowed. For purposes of this
21 paragraph, "qualified wages" means those wages used to calculate the
22 federal credit pursuant to 26 U.S.C.A., Section 45A.
23 9. In taxable years beginning after December 31, 2005, an
24 employer that is eligible for and utilizes the Safety Pays OSHA
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2194 Page 19

1 Cons ultation Service provided by the Oklahoma Department of Labor
2 shall receive an exemption from taxable income in the amount of One
3 Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00) for the tax year that the service is
4 utilized.
5 10. For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2010,
6 there shall be added to Oklahoma taxable income an amount equal to

14 Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (P.L. No. 111-5).
15 11. For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2019,

18 Oklahoma taxable income or adjusted gross income any item of loss or
19 deduction that in the absence of an election pursuant to the
20 provisions of the Pass-Through Entity Tax Equity Act of 2019 would
21 be allocated to a member or to an indirect member of an electing
22 pass-through entity pursuant to Section 2351 et seq. of this title,
23 if (i) the electing pass-through entity has accounted for such item
24 in computing its Oklahoma net entity income or loss pursuant to the
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2194 Page 20

1 prov isions of the Pass-Through Entity Tax Equity Act of 2019, and
2 (ii) the total amount of tax attributable to any resulting Oklahoma
3 net entity income has been paid. The Oklahoma Tax Commission shall
4 promulgate rules for the reporting of such exclusion to direct and
5 indirect members of the electing pass-through entity. As used in
6 this paragraph, "electing pass-through entity", "indirect member",
7 and "member" shall be defined in the same manner as prescribed by
8 Section 2355.1P-2 of this title. Notwithstanding the application of
9 this paragraph, the adjusted tax basis of any ownership interest in
10 a pass-through entity for purposes of Section 2351 et seq. of this
11 title shall be equal to its adjusted tax basis for federal income
12 tax purposes.

22 taxable income. Such corporations shall be allowed a deduction for
23 depreciation of assets placed into service after December 31, 1981,
24 in accordance with provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, 26
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2194 Page 21

1 U.S. C., Section 1 et seq., in effect immediately prior to the
2 enactment of the Accelerated Cost Recovery System. The Oklahoma tax
3 basis for all such assets placed into service after December 31,
4 1981, calculated in this section shall be retained and utilized for
5 all Oklahoma income tax purposes through the final disposition of
6 such assets.
7 Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Oklahoma Income Tax
8 Act, Section 2351 et seq. of this title, or of the Internal Revenue
