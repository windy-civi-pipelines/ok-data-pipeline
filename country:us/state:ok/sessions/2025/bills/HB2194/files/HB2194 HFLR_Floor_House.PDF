4 1. There shall be added interest income on obligations of any
5 state or political subdivision thereto which is not otherwise

10 business situs insofar as distributed income is
11 concerned,
12 (2) for taxable years beginning after December 31,

14 the sale of an ownership interest in a publicly
15 traded partnership, as defined by Section 7704(b)
16 of the Internal Revenue Code, shall be allocated
17 to this state in the ratio of the original cost
18 of such partnership's tangible property in this
19 state to the original cost of such partnership's
20 tangible property everywhere, as determined at
21 the time of the sale; if more than fifty percent
22 (50%) of the value of the partnership's assets

15 within or without the state,
16 the Oklahoma net income shall, at the option of the
17 taxpayer, be that portion of the total net income of
18 the taxpayer for federal income tax purposes derived

8 (1) except as otherwise provided by division (2) of
9 this subparagraph, taxable income of an insurance

1 Commissioners, or such other form as may be
2 prescribed in lieu thereof,
3 (2) if the principal source of premiums written by an
4 insurance company consists of premiums for
5 reinsurance accepted by it, the taxable income of
6 such company shall be apportioned to this state
7 by multiplying such income by a fraction, the
8 numerator of which is the sum of (a) direct
9 premiums written for insurance on property or
10 risks in this state, plus (b) premiums written
11 for reinsurance accepted in respect of property
12 or risks in this state, and the denominator of

2 all sources, or alternatively in the proportion
3 which the sum of the direct premiums written for
4 insurance on property or risks in this state by
5 each ceding company from which reinsurance is
6 accepted bears to the sum of the total direct
7 premiums written by each such ceding company for
8 the taxable year.
9 5. The net income or loss remaining after the separate
10 allocation in paragraph 4 of this subsection, being that which is
11 derived from a unitary business enterprise, shall be apportioned to
12 this state on the basis of the arithmetical average of three factors

14 enumerated as subparagraphs a, b and c of this paragraph. Net
15 income or loss as used in this paragraph includes that derived from
16 patent or copyright royalties, purchase discounts, and interest on
17 accounts receivable relating to or arising from a business activity,
18 the income from which is apportioned pursuant to this subsection,
19 including the sale or other disposition of such property and any
20 other property used in the unitary enterprise. Deductions used in
21 computing such net income or loss shall not include taxes based on
22 or measured by income. Provided, for corporations whose property
23 for purposes of the tax imposed by Section 2355 of this title has an
24 initial investment cost equaling or exceeding Two Hundred Million
HB2194 HFLR Page 10
BOLD FACE denotes Committee Amendments.
1 Doll ars ($200,000,000.00) and such investment is made on or after
2 July 1, 1997, or for corporations which expand their property or
3 facilities in this state and such expansion has an investment cost
4 equaling or exceeding Two Hundred Million Dollars ($200,000,000.00)
5 over a period not to exceed three (3) years, and such expansion is
6 commenced on or after January 1, 2000, the three factors shall be
7 apportioned with property and payroll, each comprising twenty-five
8 percent (25%) of the apportionment factor and sales comprising fifty
9 percent (50%) of the apportionment factor. The apportionment
10 factors shall be computed as follows:
11 a. The property factor is a fraction, the numerator of
12 which is the average value of the taxpayer's real and
13 tangible personal property owned or rented and used in
14 this state during the tax period and the denominator
15 of which is the average value of all the taxpayer's
16 real and tangible personal property everywhere owned
17 or rented and used during the tax period.
18 (1) Property, the income from which is separately
19 allocated in paragraph 4 of this subsection,
20 shall not be included in determining this
21 fraction. The numerator of the fraction shall

2 carried thereon, airplanes, salespersons'
3 automobiles and other similar equipment, in the
4 proportion that miles traveled in Oklahoma by
5 such equipment bears to total miles traveled,
6 (2) Property owned by the taxpayer is valued at its
7 original cost. Property rented by the taxpayer
8 is valued at eight times the net annual rental
9 rate. Net annual rental rate is the annual
10 rental rate paid by the taxpayer, less any annual
11 rental rate received by the taxpayer from
12 subrentals,
13 (3) The average value of property shall be determined
14 by averaging the values at the beginning and
15 ending of the tax period but the Oklahoma Tax
16 Commission may require the averaging of monthly
17 values during the tax period if reasonably
18 required to reflect properly the average value of
19 the taxpayer's property;
20 b. The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of
21 which is the total compensation for services rendered
22 in the state during the tax period, and the
23 denominator of which is the total compensation for
24 services rendered everywhere during the tax period.
HB2194 HFLR Page 12
BOLD FACE denotes Committee Amendments.
1 "Compensation", as used in this subsection means those
2 paid-for services to the extent related to the unitary
3 business but does not include officers' salaries,
4 wages and other compensation.
5 (1) In the case of a transportation enterprise, the
6 numerator of the fraction shall include a portion
7 of such expenditure in connection with employees
8 operating equipment over a fixed route, such as
9 railroad employees, airline pilots, or bus
10 drivers, in this state only a part of the time,
11 in the proportion that mileage traveled in
12 Oklahoma bears to total mileage traveled by such
13 employees,
14 (2) In any case the numerator of the fraction shall
15 include a portion of such expenditures in
16 connection with itinerant employees, such as
17 traveling salespersons, in this state only a part
18 of the time, in the proportion that time spent in
19 Oklahoma bears to total time spent in furtherance
20 of the enterprise by such employees;
21 c. The sales factor is a fraction, the numerator of which
22 is the total sales or gross revenue of the taxpayer in
23 this state during the tax period, and the denominator
24 of which is the total sales or gross revenue of the
HB2194 HFLR Page 13
BOLD FACE denotes Committee Amendments.
1 taxpayer everywhere during the tax period. "Sales",
2 as used in this subsection does not include sales or
3 gross revenue which are separately allocated in
4 paragraph 4 of this subsection.
5 (1) Sales of tangible personal property have a situs
6 in this state if the property is delivered or
7 shipped to a purchaser other than the United
8 States government, within this state regardless
9 of the FOB point or other conditions of the sale;
10 or the property is shipped from an office, store,
11 warehouse, factory or other place of storage in
12 this state and (a) the purchaser is the United
13 States government or (b) the taxpayer is not
14 doing business in the state of the destination of
15 the shipment.
16 (2) In the case of a railroad or interurban railway
17 enterprise, the numerator of the fraction shall
18 not be less than the allocation of revenues to
19 this state as shown in its annual report to the
20 Corporation Commission.
21 (3) In the case of an airline, truck or bus
22 enterprise or freight car, tank car, refrigerator
23 car or other railroad equipment enterprise, the
24 numerator of the fraction shall include a portion
HB2194 HFLR Page 14
BOLD FACE denotes Committee Amendments.
1 of revenue from interstate transportation in the
2 proportion that interstate mileage traveled in
3 Oklahoma bears to total interstate mileage
4 traveled.
5 (4) In the case of an oil, gasoline or gas pipeline
6 enterprise, the numerator of the fraction shall
7 be either the total of traffic units of the
8 enterprise within Oklahoma or the revenue
9 allocated to Oklahoma based upon miles moved, at
10 the option of the taxpayer, and the denominator
11 of which shall be the total of traffic units of
12 the enterprise or the revenue of the enterprise
13 everywhere as appropriate to the numerator. A
14 "traffic unit" is hereby defined as the
15 transportation for a distance of one (1) mile of
16 one (1) barrel of oil, one (1) gallon of gasoline
17 or one thousand (1,000) cubic feet of natural or
18 casinghead gas, as the case may be.
19 (5) In the case of a telephone or telegraph or other
20 communication enterprise, the numerator of the
21 fraction shall include that portion of the
22 interstate revenue as is allocated pursuant to
23 the accounting procedures prescribed by the
24 Federal Communications Commission; provided that
HB2194 HFLR Page 15
BOLD FACE denotes Committee Amendments.
1 in respect to each corporation or business entity
2 required by the Federal Communications Commission
3 to keep its books and records in accordance with
4 a uniform system of accounts prescribed by such
5 Commission, the intrastate net income shall be
6 determined separately in the manner provided by
7 such uniform system of accounts and only the
8 interstate income shall be subject to allocation
9 pursuant to the provisions of this subsection.
10 Provided further, that the gross revenue factors
11 shall be those as are determined pursuant to the
12 accounting procedures prescribed by the Federal
13 Communications Commission.
14 In any case where the apportionment of the three factors
15 prescribed in this paragraph attributes to Oklahoma a portion of net
16 income of the enterprise out of all appropriate proportion to the
17 property owned and/or business transacted within this state, because
18 of the fact that one or more of the factors so prescribed are not
19 employed to any appreciable extent in furtherance of the enterprise;
20 or because one or more factors not so prescribed are employed to a
21 considerable extent in furtherance of the enterprise; or because of
22 other reasons, the Tax Commission is empowered to permit, after a
23 showing by taxpayer that an excessive portion of net income has been
24 attributed to Oklahoma, or require, when in its judgment an
HB2194 HFLR Page 16
BOLD FACE denotes Committee Amendments.
1 insu fficient portion of net income has been attributed to Oklahoma,
2 the elimination, substitution, or use of additional factors, or
3 reduction or increase in the weight of such prescribed factors.
4 Provided, however, that any such variance from such prescribed
5 factors which has the effect of increasing the portion of net income
6 attributable to Oklahoma must not be inherently arbitrary, and
7 application of the recomputed final apportionment to the net income
8 of the enterprise must attribute to Oklahoma only a reasonable
9 portion thereof.
10 6. For calendar years 1997 and 1998, the owner of a new or
11 expanded agricultural commodity processing facility in this state
12 may exclude from Oklahoma taxable income, or in the case of an
13 individual, the Oklahoma adjusted gross income, fifteen percent
14 (15%) of the investment by the owner in the new or expanded
15 agricultural commodity processing facility. For calendar year 1999,
16 and all subsequent years, the percentage, not to exceed fifteen
17 percent (15%), available to the owner of a new or expanded
18 agricultural commodity processing facility in this state claiming
19 the exemption shall be adjusted annually so that the total estimated
20 reduction in tax liability does not exceed One Million Dollars
21 ($1,000,000.00) annually. The Tax Commission shall promulgate rules
22 for determining the percentage of the investment which each eligible
23 taxpayer may exclude. The exclusion provided by this paragraph
24 shall be taken in the taxable year when the investment is made. In
HB2194 HFLR Page 17
BOLD FACE denotes Committee Amendments.
1 the event the total reduction in tax liability authorized by this
2 paragraph exceeds One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) in any
3 calendar year, the Tax Commission shall permit any excess over One
4 Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) and shall factor such excess into
5 the percentage for subsequent years. Any amount of the exemption
6 permitted to be excluded pursuant to the provisions of this
7 paragraph but not used in any year may be carried forward as an
8 exemption from income pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph
9 for a period not exceeding six (6) years following the year in which
10 the investment was originally made.
11 For purposes of this paragraph:
12 a. "Agricultural commodity processing facility" means
13 building, structures, fixtures and improvements used
14 or operated primarily for the processing or production
15 of marketable products from agricultural commodities.
16 The term shall also mean a dairy operation that
17 requires a depreciable investment of at least Two
18 Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($250,000.00) and which
19 produces milk from dairy cows. The term does not
20 include a facility that provides only, and nothing
21 more than, storage, cleaning, drying or transportation
22 of agricultural commodities, and
23 b. "Facility" means each part of the facility which is
24 used in a process primarily for:
HB2194 HFLR Page 18

5 (2) transporting the agricultural commodities or
6 product before, during or after the processing,
7 or
8 (3) packaging or otherwise preparing the product for

10 7. Despite any provision to the contrary in paragraph 3 of this
11 subsection, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1999, in

13 shall be considered a net operating loss carryback in accordance
14 with and to the extent of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C.,
15 Section 172(b)(G). However, the amount of the net operating loss
16 carryback shall not exceed the lesser of:
17 a. Sixty Thousand Dollars ($60,000.00), or
18 b. the loss properly shown on Schedule F of the Internal
19 Revenue Service Form 1040 reduced by one-half (1/2) of
20 the income from all other sources other than reflected
21 on Schedule F.
22 8. In taxable years beginning after December 31, 1995, all

3 to 26 U.S.C.A., Section 45A, is allowed. For purposes of this
4 paragraph, "qualified wages" means those wages used to calculate the

3 adjusted gross income for individuals, as follows:
4 1. There shall be added interest income on obligations of any
5 state or political subdivision thereto which is not otherwise

2 commercial situs; interest income from
3 investments held to generate working capital for
4 a unitary business enterprise shall be included
5 in apportionable income; a resident trust or
6 resident estate shall be treated as having a
7 separate commercial or business situs insofar as

10 business situs insofar as distributed income is
11 concerned,
12 (2) for taxable years beginning after December 31,
13 2003, capital or ordinary gains or losses from
14 the sale of an ownership interest in a publicly
15 traded partnership, as defined by Section 7704(b)
16 of the Internal Revenue Code, shall be allocated
17 to this state in the ratio of the original cost
18 of such partnership's tangible property in this
19 state to the original cost of such partnership's
20 tangible property everywhere, as determined at
21 the time of the sale; if more than fifty percent
22 (50%) of the value of the partnership's assets

12 warehouses is not covered by "in transit"
13 tariffs, as prescribed and allowed by the
14 Interstate Commerce Commission, to a purchaser
15 within or without the state,
16 the Oklahoma net income shall, at the option of the
17 taxpayer, be that portion of the total net income of
18 the taxpayer for federal income tax purposes derived
19 from the manufacture and/or processing and sales

8 (1) except as otherwise provided by division (2) of
9 this subparagraph, taxable income of an insurance
10 company for a taxable year shall be apportioned
11 to this state by multiplying such income by a
12 fraction, the numerator of which is the direct

1 Commissioners, or such other form as may be
2 prescribed in lieu thereof,
3 (2) if the principal source of premiums written by an
4 insurance company consists of premiums for
5 reinsurance accepted by it, the taxable income of
6 such company shall be apportioned to this state
7 by multiplying such income by a fraction, the
8 numerator of which is the sum of (a) direct
9 premiums written for insurance on property or
10 risks in this state, plus (b) premiums written
11 for reinsurance accepted in respect of property
12 or risks in this state, and the denominator of
13 which is the sum of (c) direct premiums written

24 commercially domiciled in Oklahoma bears to
HB2194 HFLR Page 9
BOLD FACE denotes Committee Amendments.

1 premiums written for reinsurance accepted from
2 all sources, or alternatively in the proportion
3 which the sum of the direct premiums written for
4 insurance on property or risks in this state by
5 each ceding company from which reinsurance is
6 accepted bears to the sum of the total direct
7 premiums written by each such ceding company for
8 the taxable year.
9 5. The net income or loss remaining after the separate
10 allocation in paragraph 4 of this subsection, being that which is
11 derived from a unitary business enterprise, shall be apportioned to
12 this state on the basis of the arithmetical average of three factors
13 consisting of property, payroll and sales or gross revenue
14 enumerated as subparagraphs a, b and c of this paragraph. Net
15 income or loss as used in this paragraph includes that derived from
16 patent or copyright royalties, purchase discounts, and interest on
17 accounts receivable relating to or arising from a business activity,
18 the income from which is apportioned pursuant to this subsection,
19 including the sale or other disposition of such property and any
20 other property used in the unitary enterprise. Deductions used in
21 computing such net income or loss shall not include taxes based on
22 or measured by income. Provided, for corporations whose property
23 for purposes of the tax imposed by Section 2355 of this title has an
24 initial investment cost equaling or exceeding Two Hundred Million
HB2194 HFLR Page 10
BOLD FACE denotes Committee Amendments.

1 Doll ars ($200,000,000.00) and such investment is made on or after
2 July 1, 1997, or for corporations which expand their property or
3 facilities in this state and such expansion has an investment cost
4 equaling or exceeding Two Hundred Million Dollars ($200,000,000.00)
5 over a period not to exceed three (3) years, and such expansion is
6 commenced on or after January 1, 2000, the three factors shall be
7 apportioned with property and payroll, each comprising twenty-five
8 percent (25%) of the apportionment factor and sales comprising fifty
9 percent (50%) of the apportionment factor. The apportionment
10 factors shall be computed as follows:
11 a. The property factor is a fraction, the numerator of
12 which is the average value of the taxpayer's real and
13 tangible personal property owned or rented and used in
14 this state during the tax period and the denominator
15 of which is the average value of all the taxpayer's
16 real and tangible personal property everywhere owned
17 or rented and used during the tax period.
18 (1) Property, the income from which is separately
19 allocated in paragraph 4 of this subsection,
20 shall not be included in determining this
21 fraction. The numerator of the fraction shall
22 include a portion of the investment in
23 transportation and other equipment having no
24 fixed situs, such as rolling stock, buses, trucks
HB2194 HFLR Page 11
BOLD FACE denotes Committee Amendments.

1 and trailers, including machinery and equipment
2 carried thereon, airplanes, salespersons'
3 automobiles and other similar equipment, in the
4 proportion that miles traveled in Oklahoma by
5 such equipment bears to total miles traveled,
6 (2) Property owned by the taxpayer is valued at its
7 original cost. Property rented by the taxpayer
8 is valued at eight times the net annual rental
9 rate. Net annual rental rate is the annual
10 rental rate paid by the taxpayer, less any annual
11 rental rate received by the taxpayer from
12 subrentals,
13 (3) The average value of property shall be determined
14 by averaging the values at the beginning and
15 ending of the tax period but the Oklahoma Tax
16 Commission may require the averaging of monthly
17 values during the tax period if reasonably
18 required to reflect properly the average value of
19 the taxpayer's property;
20 b. The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of
21 which is the total compensation for services rendered
22 in the state during the tax period, and the
23 denominator of which is the total compensation for
24 services rendered everywhere during the tax period.
HB2194 HFLR Page 12
BOLD FACE denotes Committee Amendments.

1 "Compensation", as used in this subsection means those
2 paid-for services to the extent related to the unitary
3 business but does not include officers' salaries,
4 wages and other compensation.
5 (1) In the case of a transportation enterprise, the
6 numerator of the fraction shall include a portion
7 of such expenditure in connection with employees
8 operating equipment over a fixed route, such as
9 railroad employees, airline pilots, or bus
10 drivers, in this state only a part of the time,
11 in the proportion that mileage traveled in
12 Oklahoma bears to total mileage traveled by such
13 employees,
14 (2) In any case the numerator of the fraction shall
15 include a portion of such expenditures in
16 connection with itinerant employees, such as
17 traveling salespersons, in this state only a part
18 of the time, in the proportion that time spent in
19 Oklahoma bears to total time spent in furtherance
20 of the enterprise by such employees;
21 c. The sales factor is a fraction, the numerator of which
22 is the total sales or gross revenue of the taxpayer in
23 this state during the tax period, and the denominator
24 of which is the total sales or gross revenue of the
HB2194 HFLR Page 13
BOLD FACE denotes Committee Amendments.

1 taxpayer everywhere during the tax period. "Sales",
2 as used in this subsection does not include sales or
3 gross revenue which are separately allocated in
4 paragraph 4 of this subsection.
5 (1) Sales of tangible personal property have a situs
6 in this state if the property is delivered or
7 shipped to a purchaser other than the United
8 States government, within this state regardless
9 of the FOB point or other conditions of the sale;
10 or the property is shipped from an office, store,
11 warehouse, factory or other place of storage in
12 this state and (a) the purchaser is the United
13 States government or (b) the taxpayer is not
14 doing business in the state of the destination of
15 the shipment.
16 (2) In the case of a railroad or interurban railway
17 enterprise, the numerator of the fraction shall
18 not be less than the allocation of revenues to
19 this state as shown in its annual report to the
20 Corporation Commission.
21 (3) In the case of an airline, truck or bus
22 enterprise or freight car, tank car, refrigerator
23 car or other railroad equipment enterprise, the
24 numerator of the fraction shall include a portion
HB2194 HFLR Page 14
BOLD FACE denotes Committee Amendments.

1 of revenue from interstate transportation in the
2 proportion that interstate mileage traveled in
3 Oklahoma bears to total interstate mileage
4 traveled.
5 (4) In the case of an oil, gasoline or gas pipeline
6 enterprise, the numerator of the fraction shall
7 be either the total of traffic units of the
8 enterprise within Oklahoma or the revenue
9 allocated to Oklahoma based upon miles moved, at
10 the option of the taxpayer, and the denominator
11 of which shall be the total of traffic units of
12 the enterprise or the revenue of the enterprise
13 everywhere as appropriate to the numerator. A
14 "traffic unit" is hereby defined as the
15 transportation for a distance of one (1) mile of
16 one (1) barrel of oil, one (1) gallon of gasoline
17 or one thousand (1,000) cubic feet of natural or
18 casinghead gas, as the case may be.
19 (5) In the case of a telephone or telegraph or other
20 communication enterprise, the numerator of the
21 fraction shall include that portion of the
22 interstate revenue as is allocated pursuant to
23 the accounting procedures prescribed by the
24 Federal Communications Commission; provided that
HB2194 HFLR Page 15
BOLD FACE denotes Committee Amendments.

1 in respect to each corporation or business entity
2 required by the Federal Communications Commission
3 to keep its books and records in accordance with
4 a uniform system of accounts prescribed by such
5 Commission, the intrastate net income shall be
6 determined separately in the manner provided by
7 such uniform system of accounts and only the
8 interstate income shall be subject to allocation
9 pursuant to the provisions of this subsection.
10 Provided further, that the gross revenue factors
11 shall be those as are determined pursuant to the
12 accounting procedures prescribed by the Federal
13 Communications Commission.
14 In any case where the apportionment of the three factors
15 prescribed in this paragraph attributes to Oklahoma a portion of net
16 income of the enterprise out of all appropriate proportion to the
17 property owned and/or business transacted within this state, because
18 of the fact that one or more of the factors so prescribed are not
19 employed to any appreciable extent in furtherance of the enterprise;
20 or because one or more factors not so prescribed are employed to a
21 considerable extent in furtherance of the enterprise; or because of
22 other reasons, the Tax Commission is empowered to permit, after a
23 showing by taxpayer that an excessive portion of net income has been
24 attributed to Oklahoma, or require, when in its judgment an
HB2194 HFLR Page 16
BOLD FACE denotes Committee Amendments.

1 insu fficient portion of net income has been attributed to Oklahoma,
2 the elimination, substitution, or use of additional factors, or
3 reduction or increase in the weight of such prescribed factors.
4 Provided, however, that any such variance from such prescribed
5 factors which has the effect of increasing the portion of net income
6 attributable to Oklahoma must not be inherently arbitrary, and
7 application of the recomputed final apportionment to the net income
8 of the enterprise must attribute to Oklahoma only a reasonable
9 portion thereof.
10 6. For calendar years 1997 and 1998, the owner of a new or
11 expanded agricultural commodity processing facility in this state
12 may exclude from Oklahoma taxable income, or in the case of an
13 individual, the Oklahoma adjusted gross income, fifteen percent
14 (15%) of the investment by the owner in the new or expanded
15 agricultural commodity processing facility. For calendar year 1999,
16 and all subsequent years, the percentage, not to exceed fifteen
17 percent (15%), available to the owner of a new or expanded
18 agricultural commodity processing facility in this state claiming
19 the exemption shall be adjusted annually so that the total estimated
20 reduction in tax liability does not exceed One Million Dollars
21 ($1,000,000.00) annually. The Tax Commission shall promulgate rules
22 for determining the percentage of the investment which each eligible
23 taxpayer may exclude. The exclusion provided by this paragraph
24 shall be taken in the taxable year when the investment is made. In
HB2194 HFLR Page 17
BOLD FACE denotes Committee Amendments.

1 the event the total reduction in tax liability authorized by this
2 paragraph exceeds One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) in any
3 calendar year, the Tax Commission shall permit any excess over One
4 Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) and shall factor such excess into
5 the percentage for subsequent years. Any amount of the exemption
6 permitted to be excluded pursuant to the provisions of this
7 paragraph but not used in any year may be carried forward as an
8 exemption from income pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph
9 for a period not exceeding six (6) years following the year in which
10 the investment was originally made.
11 For purposes of this paragraph:
12 a. "Agricultural commodity processing facility" means
13 building, structures, fixtures and improvements used
14 or operated primarily for the processing or production
15 of marketable products from agricultural commodities.
16 The term shall also mean a dairy operation that
17 requires a depreciable investment of at least Two
18 Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($250,000.00) and which
19 produces milk from dairy cows. The term does not
20 include a facility that provides only, and nothing
21 more than, storage, cleaning, drying or transportation
22 of agricultural commodities, and
23 b. "Facility" means each part of the facility which is
24 used in a process primarily for:
HB2194 HFLR Page 18

2 including receiving or storing agricultural
3 commodities, or the production of milk at a dairy
4 operation,
5 (2) transporting the agricultural commodities or
6 product before, during or after the processing,
7 or
8 (3) packaging or otherwise preparing the product for
9 sale or shipment.
10 7. Despite any provision to the contrary in paragraph 3 of this
11 subsection, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1999, in
12 the case of a taxpayer which has a farming loss, such farming loss
13 shall be considered a net operating loss carryback in accordance
14 with and to the extent of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C.,
15 Section 172(b)(G). However, the amount of the net operating loss
16 carryback shall not exceed the lesser of:
17 a. Sixty Thousand Dollars ($60,000.00), or
18 b. the loss properly shown on Schedule F of the Internal
19 Revenue Service Form 1040 reduced by one-half (1/2) of
20 the income from all other sources other than reflected
21 on Schedule F.
22 8. In taxable years beginning after December 31, 1995, all
23 qualified wages equal to the federal income tax credit set forth in
24 26 U.S.C.A., Section 45A, shall be deducted from taxable income.

BOLD FACE denotes Committee Amendments.

1 The deduction allowed pursuant to this paragraph shall only be
2 permitted for the tax years in which the federal tax credit pursuant
3 to 26 U.S.C.A., Section 45A, is allowed. For purposes of this
4 paragraph, "qualified wages" means those wages used to calculate the
5 federal credit pursuant to 26 U.S.C.A., Section 45A.

14 and "member" shall be defined in the same manner as prescribed by
15 Section 2355.1P-2 of this title. Notwithstanding the application of
