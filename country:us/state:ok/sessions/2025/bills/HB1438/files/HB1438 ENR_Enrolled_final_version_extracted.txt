for purposes of expenditures and payments. Provided, no grant of
funds shall be made unless such grant is necessary to assist public
bodies in emergency situations. Provided also priorities for use of
loan and grant money for a particular project shall be established
by the state agency with primary responsibility. Provided further,
that the Board shall not adopt any rule, regulation or condition
requiring that a particular attorney or law firm be employed by any
eligible entity in connection with such entity's grants or loans
from the Board; and

3. The Board is hereby authorized to direct that up to fifty

in the Statewide Water Development Revolving Fund and the Water
Resources Fund Grant Account accruing from and after the date of
this act be deposited in the Statewide Water Development Revolving
Fund created under Section 1085.40 of this title.
