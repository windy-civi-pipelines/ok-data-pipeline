1 B. 1. The redbud school grants shall be determined by the
2 State Department of Education as follows:
3 a. divide the county four-mill levy revenue by four to
4 determine the nonchargeable county four-mill revenue
5 for each school district,
6 b. determine the amount of new revenue generated by the
7 five-mill building fund levy as authorized by Section
8 10 of Article X of the Oklahoma Constitution for each
9 school district as reported in the Oklahoma Cost
10 Accounting System for the preceding fiscal year,

12 this paragraph to determine the nonchargeable millage
13 for each school district,
14 d. add the nonchargeable millage in each district
15 statewide as calculated in subparagraph c of this
16 paragraph and divide the total by the average daily
17 membership in public schools statewide based on the
18 preceding school year’s average daily membership,
19 according to the provisions of Section 18-107 of this
20 title. This amount is the statewide nonchargeable
21 millage per student, known as the baseline local
22 funding per student,
23 e. all eligible charter schools shall be included in
24 these calculations as unique school districts,
ENGR. S. A. TO ENGR. H. B. NO. 1277 Page 16
1 separate from the school district that may sponsor the
2 eligible charter school, and the total number of
3 districts shall be used to determine the statewide
4 average baseline local funding per student,
5 f. for each school district or eligible charter school
6 which is below the baseline local funding per student,
7 the Department shall subtract the baseline local
8 funding per student from the average nonchargeable
9 millage per student of the school district or eligible
10 charter school to determine the nonchargeable millage
11 per student shortfall for each district, and
12 g. the nonchargeable millage per student shortfall for a
13 school district or eligible charter school shall be
14 multiplied by the average daily membership of the
15 preceding school year of the eligible school district
16 or eligible charter school. This amount shall be the
17 redbud school grant amount for the school district or
18 eligible charter school.
19 2. For fiscal year 2022, monies for the redbud school grants
20 shall be expended from the funds apportioned pursuant to Section 426
21 of Title 63 of the Oklahoma Statutes. For fiscal year 2023 and each
22 subsequent fiscal year, monies for the redbud school grants shall be
23 appropriated pursuant to Section 426 of Title 63 of the Oklahoma
24 Statutes, not to exceed three-fourths (3/4) of the tax collected in
ENGR. S. A. TO ENGR. H. B. NO. 1277 Page 17
1 the preceding fiscal year pursuant to Section 426 of Title 63 of the
2 Oklahoma Statutes as determined by the Oklahoma Tax Commission. For
3 fiscal year 2023 and each subsequent fiscal year, if such
4 appropriated funds are insufficient to fund the redbud school
5 grants, then an additional apportionment of funds shall be made from
6 sales tax collections as provided by subsection D of Section 1353 of
7 Title 68 of the Oklahoma Statutes. If both funds are insufficient,
8 the Department shall promulgate rules to permit a decrease to the
9 baseline local funding per student to the highest amount allowed
10 with the funding available.
11 3. As used in this section, “eligible charter school” shall

1 B. 1. The redbud school grants shall be determined by the
2 State Department of Education as follows:
3 a. divide the county four-mill levy revenue by four to
4 determine the nonchargeable county four-mill revenue
5 for each school district,
6 b. determine the amount of new revenue generated by the
7 five-mill building fund levy as authorized by Section
8 10 of Article X of the Oklahoma Constitution for each
9 school district as reported in the Oklahoma Cost
10 Accounting System for the preceding fiscal year,
11 c. add the amounts calculated in subparagraphs a and b of
12 this paragraph to determine the nonchargeable millage
13 for each school district,
14 d. add the nonchargeable millage in each district
15 statewide as calculated in subparagraph c of this
16 paragraph and divide the total by the average daily
17 membership in public schools statewide based on the
18 preceding school year’s average daily membership,
19 according to the provisions of Section 18-107 of this
20 title. This amount is the statewide nonchargeable
21 millage per student, known as the baseline local
22 funding per student,
23 e. all eligible charter schools shall be included in
24 these calculations as unique school districts,
ENGR. S. A. TO ENGR. H. B. NO. 1277 Page 16

1 separate from the school district that may sponsor the
2 eligible charter school, and the total number of
3 districts shall be used to determine the statewide
4 average baseline local funding per student,
5 f. for each school district or eligible charter school
6 which is below the baseline local funding per student,
7 the Department shall subtract the baseline local
8 funding per student from the average nonchargeable
9 millage per student of the school district or eligible
10 charter school to determine the nonchargeable millage
11 per student shortfall for each district, and
12 g. the nonchargeable millage per student shortfall for a
13 school district or eligible charter school shall be
14 multiplied by the average daily membership of the
15 preceding school year of the eligible school district
16 or eligible charter school. This amount shall be the
17 redbud school grant amount for the school district or
18 eligible charter school.
19 2. For fiscal year 2022, monies for the redbud school grants
20 shall be expended from the funds apportioned pursuant to Section 426
21 of Title 63 of the Oklahoma Statutes. For fiscal year 2023 and each
22 subsequent fiscal year, monies for the redbud school grants shall be
23 appropriated pursuant to Section 426 of Title 63 of the Oklahoma
24 Statutes, not to exceed three-fourths (3/4) of the tax collected in

1 the preceding fiscal year pursuant to Section 426 of Title 63 of the
2 Oklahoma Statutes as determined by the Oklahoma Tax Commission. For
3 fiscal year 2023 and each subsequent fiscal year, if such
4 appropriated funds are insufficient to fund the redbud school
5 grants, then an additional apportionment of funds shall be made from
6 sales tax collections as provided by subsection D of Section 1353 of
7 Title 68 of the Oklahoma Statutes. If both funds are insufficient,
8 the Department shall promulgate rules to permit a decrease to the
9 baseline local funding per student to the highest amount allowed
10 with the funding available.

6 Appropriations and Budget Committee and the chair of the Senate
7 Appropriations Committee no later than February 1 of each year with
8 an estimate of the upcoming year’s redbud school grant allocation as
9 prescribed by this section.
10 SECTION 2. This act shall become effective July 1, 2025.
