Section 2:
SECTION 1. NEW LAW A new section of law not to be
15
16
codified in the Oklahoma Statutes reads as follows:
16
17
This act shall be known and may be cited as the “Promote Child
17
18
Thriving Act”.

Section 3:
SECTION 2. NEW LAW A new section of law not to be
19
20
codified in the Oklahoma Statutes reads as follows:
20
21
The Legislature finds that:
21
22

Section 4:
1. Children have a primal and indelible relation to their
22
23
mother and father. It is a fundamental claim of justice that,
23
24
whenever possible, children be raised in a marital home by the two
24
Req. No. 1427 Page 1
1
persons whose union gave them life, bequeathed them their unique
1
2
identity and characteristics, and joined them to a genealogical
2
3
history of maternal and paternal kinship. It is a compelling state
3
4
interest, priority, and responsibility to honor and protect the
4
5
natural marital family context for the sake of children whose
5
6
identity and life prospects are so substantially implicated by it;
6
7

Section 5:
2. Accordingly, and as Justice Sotomayor summarized in her
7
8
dissenting opinion in Adoptive Couple v. Baby Girl, 570 U.S. 637,
8
9
673 (2013) (Sotomayor, J., dissenting), that the biological bond
9
10
between parent and child is meaningful, that children have an
10
11
interest in knowing their biological parents, and that the
11
12
deprivation of a child’s relationship with mother or father is a
12
13
loss that cannot be measured;
13
14

Section 6:
3. The natural family relationship of husband and wife and
14
15
their offspring is an aspect of human nature and community anterior
15
16
to and transcending state discretion. As the Supreme Court
16
17
acknowledged in Smith v. Org. of Foster Families for Equal & Reform,
17
18
431 U.S. 816, 845 (1977), unlike, for instance, the state-initiated
18
19
and -directed foster care relation, the natural family is “a
19
20
relationship having its origins entirely apart from the power of the
20
21
State,” therefore has its unique prerogatives founded “in intrinsic
21
22
human rights, as they have been understood in this Nation’s history
22
23
and tradition”;
23
24
24
Req. No. 1427 Page 2
1

Section 7:
4. Federal and state constitutional case law and historic state
1
2
family law standards accord unique deference and protection to the
2
3
marital relationship and the relation of natural mother and father
3
4
to child, and that a child’s loss of relationship with the child’s
4
5
mother or father is a lamentable outcome that venerable legal
5
6
standards aim to discourage and avoid;
6
7

Section 8:
5. Evidence from multiple areas of study reveals that children
7
8
who grow up apart from one or both biological parents tend, by
8
9
statistically significant margins, to fare worse and to be
9
10
substantially disadvantaged compared to cohorts of children raised
10
11
by their mother and father in a marital household. And that:
11
12
a. biological parents are statistically the safest, most
12
13
connected to, most invested in, and most protective
13
14
adults in a child’s life. Children who are raised by
14
15
both biological parents in a married relationship
15
16
suffer the lowest rates of obesity, drug use, and
16
17
incarceration. They have the highest rates of
17
18
academic success and emotional health, and are most
18
19
likely to escape or avoid poverty,
19
20
b. loss of a parent affects a child’s physical,
20
21
mental/emotional, and educational outcomes,
21
22
c. cohabitation of a child’s biological parents does not
22
23
produce the same benefit for children. Studies show
23
24
the nonmarital cohabitation relationship of a child’s
24
Req. No. 1427 Page 3
1
mother and father is not a benefit equivalent to a
1
2
home of a married father and mother, citing increased
2
3
risk of parental breakup, abuse, and poverty,
3
4
d. there are no known remedial government programs or
4
5
subsidies which can replace or compensate for the loss
5
6
to children of an upbringing in the marital home of
6
7
their mother and father, and
7
8
e. being raised outside of the home of a child’s married
8
9
biological parents tends toward multigenerational
9
10
continuation. Data reveals that children of single
10
11
mothers are more likely to have children out of
11
12
marriage, children of divorce are more likely to
12
13
themselves divorce, and children created via third-
13
14
party sperm or egg are more likely to dissociate
14
15
themselves from their genetic children via “donating”
15
16
when they reach adulthood. Failing to fortify a
16
17
child’s family leads to future broken families;
17
18

Section 9:
6. The clear connection between natural parental bonds and
18
19
child welfare obligates the state to incentivize homes that unite
19
20
children to both mother and father. Studies show that the best
20
21
means to achieve that end is to encourage biological parents to be
21
22
married to one another; and
22
23

Section 10:
7. This state’s financial incentivizing of children’s
23
24
upbringing in a home with their married mother and father will
24
Req. No. 1427 Page 4
1
minimize the need for government anti-poverty funds, child
1
2
protective services, academic support, police involvement, and other
2
3
state emergency or remedial aid.
3
4

Section 11:
SECTION 3. NEW LAW A new section of law to be codified
4
5
in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 2357.701 of Title 68, unless
5
6
there is created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:
6
7
A. For tax year 2025 and subsequent tax years, there shall be
7
8
allowed a credit against the tax imposed pursuant to Section 2355 of
8
9

10
biological children in the following amounts:

1. Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00) for each child under 18 years
11
12
of age and residing in the parents’ home while the child’s
12
13
biological mother and father are married to each other; and
13
14

Section 13:
2. One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00) for each child under 18
14
15
years of age if the child’s biological mother and father were
15
16
married prior to the child’s birth.
16
17
B. To qualify for the credit authorized pursuant to subsection
17
18
A of this section, the biological parents shall:
18
19

Section 14:
1. Be listed on the birth certificate of the dependent or be
19
20
the custodial parent during the entirety of the tax year;
20
21

Section 15:
2. Reside in the same household as the dependent for at least
21
22
six (6) months of the tax year, except when:
22
23
a. a biological parent is enlisted as an active duty
23
24
member of the Armed Forces of the United States and
24
Req. No. 1427 Page 5
1
deployed for at least six (6) months of the tax year,
1
2
or
2
3
b. the dependent is born during the tax year; and
3
4

Section 16:
3. Be married for the entirety of the tax year.
4
5
C. The credit authorized pursuant to this section shall be
5
6
claimed on a form prescribed by the Oklahoma Tax Commission and
6
7
shall include, under penalty of perjury, the following statements of
7
8
attestation:
8
9

1. That the taxpayers are legally married;
9
10

Section 18:
2. That the taxpayers have resided in the same household with
10
11
the child for at least six (6) months of the calendar year
11
12
corresponding to the tax year for which the credit is claimed,
12
13
unless exempted pursuant to paragraph 2 of subsection B of this
13
14

Section 19:
section; and
14
15

Section 20:
3. That the dependent is the biological child of the taxpayers.
15
16
D. The credit allowed pursuant to the provisions of this
16
17

Section 21:
section shall not be used to reduce the income tax liability of the
17
18
taxpayer to less than zero (0).
18
19
E. If the amount of the credit allowed pursuant to this section
19
20
exceeds the income tax liability, the amount of credit not used in
20
21
any tax year may be carried forward, in order, to each of the ten
21
22
(10) subsequent tax years.
22
23
F. Claims for credit pursuant to this section that contain
23
24
fraudulent information shall be denied, and the Tax Commission shall
24
Req. No. 1427 Page 6
1
recover any allowed credit claimed with fraudulent information and
1
2
may levy penalties in an amount not to exceed Five Hundred Dollars
2
3
($500.00).

be in full force from and after its passage and approval.
