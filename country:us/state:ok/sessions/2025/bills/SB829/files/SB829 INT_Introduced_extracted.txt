Section 16:
Section 121. A. When a dissolution of marriage is granted, the
15
16
decree shall restore:
16
17

Section 17:
1. To the wife her maiden or former name, if her name was
17
18
changed as a result of the marriage and if she so desires; and
18
19

Section 18:
2. To the husband his former name, if his name was changed as a
19
20
result of the marriage and if he so desires.
20
21
B. The court shall enter its decree confirming in each spouse
21
22
the property owned by him or her before marriage and the undisposed-
22
23
of property acquired after marriage by him or her in his or her own
23
24
right. Either spouse may be allowed such alimony out of real and
24
Req. No. 1343 Page 7
1
personal property of the other as the court shall think reasonable,
1
2
having due regard to the value of such property at the time of the
2
3
dissolution of marriage. Alimony may be allowed from real or
3
4
personal property, or both, or in the form of money judgment,
4
5
payable either in gross or in installments, as the court may deem
5
6
just and equitable. As to such property, whether real or personal,
6
7
which has been acquired by the parties jointly during their
7
8
marriage, whether the title thereto be in either or both of said the
8
9
parties, the court shall, subject to a valid antenuptial contract in
9
10
writing, make such division between the parties as may appear just
10
11
and reasonable, by a division of the property in kind, or by setting
11
12
the same apart to one of the parties, and requiring the other
12
13
thereof to be paid such sum as may be just and proper to effect a
13
14
fair and just division thereof. The court may set apart a portion
14
15
of the separate estate of a spouse to the other spouse for the
15
16
support of the children of the marriage where custody resides with
16
17
that spouse. In all orders entered pursuant to this section, the
17
18
court shall consider the degree of harm caused by a party, or both
18
19
parties, held at fault for the dissolution of the marriage.
19
20
C. A servicemember’s portion of Special Monthly Compensation
20
21
(SMC) awarded by or from the United States Department of Veterans
21
22
Affairs for service-connected loss or loss of use of specific organs
22
23
or extremities shall be separate property, not divisible as a
23
24
marital asset nor as community property. For purposes of
24
Req. No. 1343 Page 8

to prove with competent evidence what amount of his or her
2
3
disability compensation is SMC.
3
4
D. A servicemember’s portion of Combat-Related Special
4
5
Compensation (CRSC) shall be separate property, not divisible as a
5
6
marital asset nor as community property, if a specific dollar amount
6
7
of CRSC can be proved by the servicemember as compensation for
7
8
combat-related loss of limb or loss of bodily function and the CRSC
8
9
award was applied for and established prior to the date of the
9
10
filing of the dissolution of marriage action.
10
11
E. Pursuant to the federal Uniformed Services Former Spouses’
11
12
Protection Act, 10 U.S.C., Section 1408, a court may treat
12
13
disposable retired or retainer pay payable to a military member
13
14
either as property solely of the member or as property of the member
14
15
and the spouse of the member. If a state court determines that the
15
16
disposable retired or retainer pay of a military member is the sole
16
17
and separate property of the military member, the court shall submit
17
18
clear and concise written findings of such determination to be
18
19
included in the decree or final order. If a state court determines
19
20
that the disposable retired or retainer pay of a military member is
20
21
marital property, the court shall submit clear and concise written
21
22
findings of such determination to be included in the decree or final
22
23
order and shall award an amount consistent with the rank, pay grade,
23
24
and time of service of the member at the date of the filing of the
24
Req. No. 1343 Page 9
1
petition, unless the court finds a more equitable date due to the
1
2
economic separation of the parties.
2
3
F. Unless otherwise agreed to by the parties, any division of
3
4
an active duty military member’s retirement or retainer pay shall
4
5
use the following language:
5
6
“The former spouse is awarded a percentage of the member’s
6
7
disposable military retired pay, to be computed by multiplying fifty
7
8
percent (50%) times a fraction, the numerator of which is ____x____
8
9
months of marriage during the member’s creditable military service,
9
10
divided by the member’s total number of months of creditable
10
11
military service.”
11
12
G. In the case of a member’s retiring from reserve duty, unless
12
13
otherwise agreed by the parties, any division of a reservist’s
13
14
retirement or retainer pay shall use the following language:
14
15
“The former spouse is awarded a percentage of the member’s
15
16
disposable military retired pay, to be computed by multiplying fifty
16
17
percent (50%) times a fraction, the numerator of which is
17
18
__X____reserve retirement points earned during the period of the
18
19
marriage, divided by the member’s total number of reserve retirement
19
20
points earned.”

SECTION 3. AMENDATORY 43 O.S. 2021, Section 121, is
13
14
amended to read as follows:

15
Section 121. A. When a dissolution of marriage is granted, the
15
16
decree shall restore:
16

17
18
changed as a result of the marriage and if she so desires; and

19
20
result of the marriage and if he so desires.
20
21
B. The court shall enter its decree confirming in each spouse
21
22
the property owned by him or her before marriage and the undisposed-
22
23
of property acquired after marriage by him or her in his or her own
23
24
right. Either spouse may be allowed such alimony out of real and
24
Req. No. 1343 Page 7

1
personal property of the other as the court shall think reasonable,
1
2
having due regard to the value of such property at the time of the
2
3
dissolution of marriage. Alimony may be allowed from real or
3
4
personal property, or both, or in the form of money judgment,
4
5
payable either in gross or in installments, as the court may deem
5
6
just and equitable. As to such property, whether real or personal,
6
7
which has been acquired by the parties jointly during their
7
8
marriage, whether the title thereto be in either or both of said the
8
9
parties, the court shall, subject to a valid antenuptial contract in
9
10
writing, make such division between the parties as may appear just
10
11
and reasonable, by a division of the property in kind, or by setting
11
12
the same apart to one of the parties, and requiring the other
12
13
thereof to be paid such sum as may be just and proper to effect a
13
14
fair and just division thereof. The court may set apart a portion
14
15
of the separate estate of a spouse to the other spouse for the
15
16
support of the children of the marriage where custody resides with
16
17
that spouse. In all orders entered pursuant to this section, the
17
18
court shall consider the degree of harm caused by a party, or both
18
19
parties, held at fault for the dissolution of the marriage.

22
Affairs for service-connected loss or loss of use of specific organs
22
23

23
24
marital asset nor as community property. For purposes of
24
Req. No. 1343 Page 8

2
3

3
4
D. A servicemember’s portion of Combat-Related Special
4
5
Compensation (CRSC) shall be separate property, not divisible as a
5
6
marital asset nor as community property, if a specific dollar amount
6
7
of CRSC can be proved by the servicemember as compensation for
7
8
combat-related loss of limb or loss of bodily function and the CRSC
8
9
award was applied for and established prior to the date of the
9
10
filing of the dissolution of marriage action.
10
11
E. Pursuant to the federal Uniformed Services Former Spouses’
11
12

12
13
disposable retired or retainer pay payable to a military member
13
14
either as property solely of the member or as property of the member
14
15
and the spouse of the member. If a state court determines that the
15
16
disposable retired or retainer pay of a military member is the sole
16
17
and separate property of the military member, the court shall submit
17
18
clear and concise written findings of such determination to be
18
19
included in the decree or final order. If a state court determines
19
20
that the disposable retired or retainer pay of a military member is
20
21
marital property, the court shall submit clear and concise written
21
22
findings of such determination to be included in the decree or final
22
23
order and shall award an amount consistent with the rank, pay grade,
23
24
and time of service of the member at the date of the filing of the
24
Req. No. 1343 Page 9

1
petition, unless the court finds a more equitable date due to the
1
2
economic separation of the parties.
2
3
F. Unless otherwise agreed to by the parties, any division of
3
4
an active duty military member’s retirement or retainer pay shall
4
5
use the following language:

6
“The former spouse is awarded a percentage of the member’s
6
7
disposable military retired pay, to be computed by multiplying fifty
7
8
percent (50%) times a fraction, the numerator of which is ____x____
8
9
months of marriage during the member’s creditable military service,
9
10
divided by the member’s total number of months of creditable
10
11
military service.”

G. In the case of a member’s retiring from reserve duty, unless
12
13
otherwise agreed by the parties, any division of a reservist’s
13
14
retirement or retainer pay shall use the following language:
14
15
“The former spouse is awarded a percentage of the member’s
15
16
disposable military retired pay, to be computed by multiplying fifty
16
17
percent (50%) times a fraction, the numerator of which is
17
18
__X____reserve retirement points earned during the period of the
18
19
marriage, divided by the member’s total number of reserve retirement
19
20
points earned.”
