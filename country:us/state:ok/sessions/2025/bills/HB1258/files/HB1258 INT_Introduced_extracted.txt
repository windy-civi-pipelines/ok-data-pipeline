Req. No. 12184 Page 11

7 contributions shall not be includable in the gross income of the
8 participating employee until such amounts are distributed or made

12 system created by this act. Thereafter, the contracting process for

10 requirements of Section 401(a)(13) or similar provisions of the
11 Internal Revenue Code. The offset applies to any assets held in the
12 plan which may otherwise be payable to a participating employee or
