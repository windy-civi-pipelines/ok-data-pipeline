3 (1) except as otherwise provided by division (2) of
4 this subparagraph, taxable income of an insurance
5 company for a taxable year shall be apportioned
6 to this state by multiplying such income by a
7 fraction, the numerator of which is the direct

SENATE FLOOR VERSION - SB48 SFLR Page 8
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)

1 by multiplying such income by a fraction, the
2 numerator of which is the sum of (a) direct
3 premiums written for insurance on property or
4 risks in this state, plus (b) premiums written
5 for reinsurance accepted in respect of property
6 or risks in this state, and the denominator of

10 accepted in respect of property or risks
11 everywhere. For purposes of this paragraph,
12 premiums written for reinsurance accepted in
13 respect of property or risks in this state,
14 whether or not otherwise determinable, may at the
15 election of the company be determined on the
16 basis of the proportion which premiums written

19 bears to premiums written for reinsurance
20 accepted from all sources, or alternatively in
21 the proportion which the sum of the direct
22 premiums written for insurance on property or
23 risks in this state by each ceding company from
24 which reinsurance is accepted bears to the sum of
SENATE FLOOR VERSION - SB48 SFLR Page 9
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)

1 the total direct premiums written by each such
2 ceding company for the taxable year.
3 5. The net income or loss remaining after the separate
4 allocation in paragraph 4 of this subsection, being that which is
5 derived from a unitary business enterprise, shall be apportioned to
6 this state on the basis of the arithmetical average of three factors
7 consisting of property, payroll and sales or gross revenue
8 enumerated as subparagraphs a, b and c of this paragraph. Net
9 income or loss as used in this paragraph includes that derived from
10 patent or copyright royalties, purchase discounts, and interest on
11 accounts receivable relating to or arising from a business activity,
12 the income from which is apportioned pursuant to this subsection,
13 including the sale or other disposition of such property and any
14 other property used in the unitary enterprise. Deductions used in
15 computing such net income or loss shall not include taxes based on
16 or measured by income. Provided, for corporations whose property
17 for purposes of the tax imposed by Section 2355 of this title has an
18 initial investment cost equaling or exceeding Two Hundred Million
19 Dollars ($200,000,000.00) and such investment is made on or after
20 July 1, 1997, or for corporations which expand their property or
21 facilities in this state and such expansion has an investment cost
22 equaling or exceeding Two Hundred Million Dollars ($200,000,000.00)
23 over a period not to exceed three (3) years, and such expansion is
24 commenced on or after January 1, 2000, the three factors shall be
SENATE FLOOR VERSION - SB48 SFLR Page 10
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)

1 appo rtioned with property and payroll, each comprising twenty-five
2 percent (25%) of the apportionment factor and sales comprising fifty
3 percent (50%) of the apportionment factor. The apportionment
4 factors shall be computed as follows:
5 a. The property factor is a fraction, the numerator of
6 which is the average value of the taxpayer’s real and
7 tangible personal property owned or rented and used in
8 this state during the tax period and the denominator
9 of which is the average value of all the taxpayer’s
10 real and tangible personal property everywhere owned
11 or rented and used during the tax period.
12 (1) Property, the income from which is separately
13 allocated in paragraph 4 of this subsection,
14 shall not be included in determining this
15 fraction. The numerator of the fraction shall
16 include a portion of the investment in
17 transportation and other equipment having no
18 fixed situs, such as rolling stock, buses, trucks
19 and trailers, including machinery and equipment
20 carried thereon, airplanes, salespersons’
21 automobiles and other similar equipment, in the
22 proportion that miles traveled in Oklahoma this
23 state by such equipment bears to total miles
24 traveled,

(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)

1 (2) Property owned by the taxpayer is valued at its
2 original cost. Property rented by the taxpayer
3 is valued at eight times the net annual rental
4 rate. Net annual rental rate is the annual
5 rental rate paid by the taxpayer, less any annual
6 rental rate received by the taxpayer from
7 subrentals,
8 (3) The average value of property shall be determined
9 by averaging the values at the beginning and
10 ending of the tax period but the Oklahoma Tax
11 Commission may require the averaging of monthly
12 values during the tax period if reasonably
13 required to reflect properly the average value of
14 the taxpayer’s property;
15 b. The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of
16 which is the total compensation for services rendered
17 in the state during the tax period, and the
18 denominator of which is the total compensation for
19 services rendered everywhere during the tax period.
20 “Compensation”, as used in this subsection, means
21 those paid-for services to the extent related to the
22 unitary business but does not include officers’
23 salaries, wages and other compensation.

6 drivers, in this state only a part of the time,
7 in the proportion that mileage traveled in
8 Oklahoma this state bears to total mileage
9 traveled by such employees,
10 (2) In any case the numerator of the fraction shall
11 include a portion of such expenditures in
12 connection with itinerant employees, such as

14 of the time, in the proportion that time spent in
15 Oklahoma this state bears to total time spent in
16 furtherance of the enterprise by such employees;
17 c. The sales factor is a fraction, the numerator of which
18 is the total sales or gross revenue of the taxpayer in
19 this state during the tax period, and the denominator
20 of which is the total sales or gross revenue of the
21 taxpayer everywhere during the tax period. “Sales”,
22 as used in this subsection, does not include sales or
23 gross revenue which are separately allocated in
24 paragraph 4 of this subsection.

15 this state as shown in its annual report to the
16 Corporation Commission.
17 (3) In the case of an airline, truck or bus
18 enterprise or freight car, tank car, refrigerator
19 car or other railroad equipment enterprise, the
20 numerator of the fraction shall include a portion
21 of revenue from interstate transportation in the
22 proportion that interstate mileage traveled in

1 (4) In the case of an oil, gasoline or gas pipeline
2 enterprise, the numerator of the fraction shall
3 be either the total of traffic units of the

6 upon miles moved, at the option of the taxpayer,
7 and the denominator of which shall be the total
8 of traffic units of the enterprise or the revenue
9 of the enterprise everywhere as appropriate to
10 the numerator. A “traffic unit” is hereby
11 defined as the transportation for a distance of
12 one (1) mile of one (1) barrel of oil, one (1)
13 gallon of gasoline or one thousand (1,000) cubic
14 feet of natural or casinghead gas, as the case

2 Commission, the intrastate net income shall be
3 determined separately in the manner provided by

6 pursuant to the provisions of this subsection.
7 Provided further, that the gross revenue factors
8 shall be those as are determined pursuant to the
9 accounting procedures prescribed by the Federal
10 Communications Commission.
11 In any case where the apportionment of the three factors
12 prescribed in this paragraph attributes to Oklahoma this state a
13 portion of net income of the enterprise out of all appropriate
14 proportion to the property owned and/or business transacted within
15 this state, because of the fact that one or more of the factors so
16 prescribed are not employed to any appreciable extent in furtherance
17 of the enterprise; or because one or more factors not so prescribed
18 are employed to a considerable extent in furtherance of the
19 enterprise; or because of other reasons, the Tax Commission is
20 empowered to permit, after a showing by taxpayer that an excessive
21 portion of net income has been attributed to Oklahoma this state, or
22 require, when in its judgment an insufficient portion of net income
23 has been attributed to Oklahoma this state, the elimination,
24 substitution, or use of additional factors, or reduction or increase
SENATE FLOOR VERSION - SB48 SFLR Page 16
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)

1 in t he weight of such prescribed factors. Provided, however, that
2 any such variance from such prescribed factors which has the effect
3 of increasing the portion of net income attributable to Oklahoma
4 this state must not be inherently arbitrary, and application of the
5 recomputed final apportionment to the net income of the enterprise
6 must attribute to Oklahoma this state only a reasonable portion
7 thereof.
8 6. For calendar years 1997 and 1998, the owner of a new or
9 expanded agricultural commodity processing facility in this state
10 may exclude from Oklahoma taxable income, or in the case of an
11 individual, the Oklahoma adjusted gross income, fifteen percent
12 (15%) of the investment by the owner in the new or expanded
13 agricultural commodity processing facility. For calendar year 1999,
14 and all subsequent years, the percentage, not to exceed fifteen
15 percent (15%), available to the owner of a new or expanded
16 agricultural commodity processing facility in this state claiming
17 the exemption shall be adjusted annually so that the total estimated
18 reduction in tax liability does not exceed One Million Dollars
19 ($1,000,000.00) annually. The Tax Commission shall promulgate rules
20 for determining the percentage of the investment which each eligible
21 taxpayer may exclude. The exclusion provided by this paragraph
22 shall be taken in the taxable year when the investment is made. In
23 the event the total reduction in tax liability authorized by this
24 paragraph exceeds One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) in any
SENATE FLOOR VERSION - SB48 SFLR Page 17
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)

1 cale ndar year, the Tax Commission shall permit any excess over One
2 Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) and shall factor such excess into
3 the percentage for subsequent years. Any amount of the exemption
4 permitted to be excluded pursuant to the provisions of this
5 paragraph but not used in any year may be carried forward as an
6 exemption from income pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph
7 for a period not exceeding six (6) years following the year in which
8 the investment was originally made.
9 For purposes of this paragraph:
