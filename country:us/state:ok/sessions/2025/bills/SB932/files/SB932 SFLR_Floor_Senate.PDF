9 subsection C of this section is entitled to a rebuttable presumption
10 that:

12 caused, in whole or in part, by the minor user’s

14 media platform, and
15 b. the minor user’s excessive use of the algorithmically
16 curated social media platform was not caused, in whole

19 driven design elements.
20 5. If a court or fact finder finds that minor user of this
21 state suffered any adverse mental health outcome as a result of the

23 service, the person seeking relief is entitled to:
