1 Section 8C. A. Despite any provision to the contrary,
2 beginning January 1, 2005, the fair cash value, as determined by
3 law, on each homestead of an individual head of household whose
4 gross household income from all sources for the preceding calendar
5 year did not exceed an amount as provided in subsection B of this
6 section, and which individual head of household is sixty-five (65)
7 years of age or older, shall not exceed the fair cash value placed
8 upon the property during the first year in which the individual head
9 of household was sixty-five (65) years of age or older and had gross
10 household income from all sources which did not exceed an amount as
11 provided in subsection B of this section. Subject to the
12 limitations of this section, the fair cash value shall not exceed
13 such amount as long as the individual head of household who is
14 sixty-five (65) years of age or older owns and occupies the property
15 and as long as the gross household income from all sources does not
16 exceed an amount as provided in subsection B of this section. If
17 any improvements are made to the property, the fair cash value of
18 the improvements shall be assessed in accordance with law by the
19 county assessor and added to the assessed value of the property.
20 Once the fair cash value of the improvements has been added to the
21 fair cash value of the property, the total fair cash value shall not
22 exceed the revised valuation of the property so long as the
23 individual head of household who is sixty-five (65) years of age or
24 older owns and occupies the property and so long as the gross

1 hous ehold income from all sources does not exceed an amount as
2 provided in subsection B of this section. For any individual head
3 of household who is sixty-five (65) years of age or older prior to
4 January 1, 1997, and has gross household income from all sources of
5 Twenty-five Thousand Dollars ($25,000.00) or less in calendar year
6 1996, the fair cash value of the real property shall be the fair
7 cash value placed upon the property on January 1, 1997. If the
8 individual head of household ceases to own and occupy the property
9 or if the gross household income from all sources exceeds an amount
10 as provided in subsection B of this section, the fair cash value of
11 the property shall be determined as if the provisions of Section 8
12 of Article X this article of the Oklahoma Constitution of the State
13 of Oklahoma or any other provisions relating to a limitation on the
14 fair cash value of locally assessed real property had been in effect
15 during the time the property was valued pursuant to the provisions
16 of this section.
17 B. The income threshold for the gross household income from all
18 sources for an individual head of household under subsection A of
19 this section shall not exceed the amount determined by the United
20 States Department of Housing and Urban Development to be the
21 estimated median income for the preceding year for the county or
22 metropolitan statistical area which includes such county. The
23 Oklahoma Tax Commission shall provide such information to each

1 coun ty assessor each year as soon as such information becomes
2 available.
3 C. For tax years 2026 and subsequent tax years, there shall be
4 allowed a credit against the ad valorem tax levied pursuant to this
5 article of the Oklahoma Constitution for owners of a homestead that
6 qualify for the limitation on the increase of fair cash value
7 pursuant to subsection A of this section in an amount equal to the
8 difference between the ad valorem tax liability of the property
9 owner for the homestead property of the prior tax year and the ad
10 valorem tax liability for the homestead property in the tax year in
11 which the property owner first qualified for the limitation on the
12 increase of fair cash value pursuant to subsection A of this
13 section. Provided, if the ad valorem tax liability of the property
14 owner for the homestead property in the tax year in which the
15 property owner first qualified for the limitation on the increase of
16 fair cash value pursuant to subsection A of this section exceeds the
17 ad valorem tax liability of the property for the homestead property
18 in the prior tax year, there shall be no credit allowed.
19 D. The credit authorized pursuant to subsection C of this
20 section shall be claimed on a form prescribed by the county assessor
21 for the county in which the homestead is located no later than
22 October 1 of each tax year. The county assessor shall deduct
23 qualifying claims for credit from the tax liability of the property
24 owner.

9 THE GIST OF THE PROPOSITION IS AS FOLLOWS:
10 This measure amends Section 8C of Article 10 of the Oklahoma
11 Constitution. The measure provides a property tax credit on the
12 homestead of an individual head of household who is at least
13 sixty-five years of age and qualifies for the limitation on the
14 growth of fair cash value. The property tax credit would be
15 equal to the difference between the property owner’s current
16 property tax liability for the homestead and the property tax
17 liability of the homestead the year in which the homestead first
18 qualified for the limitation on fair cash value. This ensures
19 that the property tax liability does not increase on the
20 homestead so long as the homestead qualifies.
