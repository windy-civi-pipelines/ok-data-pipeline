B. DISCOVERY SCOPE AND LIMITS. Unless otherwise limited by
10
11
order of the court in accordance with the Oklahoma Discovery Code,
11
12
the scope of discovery is as follows:
12
13

Section 7:
1. IN GENERAL.
13
14
a. Parties may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not
14
15
privileged, which is relevant to any party’s claim or
15
16
defense, reasonably calculated to lead to the
16
17
discovery of admissible evidence and proportional to
17
18
the needs of the case, considering the importance of
18
19
the issues at stake in the action, the amount in
19
20
controversy, the parties’ relative access to relevant
20
21
information, the parties’ resources, the importance of
21
22
the discovery in resolving the issues, and whether the
22
23
burden or expense of the proposed discovery outweighs
23
24
its likely benefit. Information within this scope of
24
Req. No. 847 Page 4
1
discovery need not be admissible in evidence to be
1
2
discoverable.
2
3
b. A party shall produce upon request pursuant to Section
3
4
3234 of this title, any insurance agreement under
4
5
which any person carrying on an insurance business may
5
6
be liable to satisfy part or all of a judgment which
6
7
may be entered in the action or to indemnify or
7
8
reimburse for payments made to satisfy the judgment.
8
9
Information concerning the insurance agreement is not
9
10
by reason of disclosure admissible in evidence at
10
11
trial. For purposes of this section, an application
11
12
for insurance shall not be treated as a part of an
12
13
insurance agreement.
13
14
c. A party shall produce upon request, pursuant to
14
15

Section 8:
Section 3234 of this title, any commercial litigation
15
16
funding agreement as defined in Section 2 of this act.
16
17
Information related to the commercial litigation
17
18
funding agreement is not by reason of disclosure
18
19
admissible as evidence at trial. Production of a
19
20
commercial litigation funding agreement shall include
20
21
a certification by sworn affidavit by the producing
21
22
party as to whether any funds encumbered by the terms
22
23
of the agreement have been or will be sourced from a
23
24
foreign state or agency or instrumentality of a
24
Req. No. 847 Page 5
1
foreign state as defined in 28 U.S.C., Section 1603,
1
2
as amended. Certification that discloses that a
2
3
foreign state or agency or instrumentality of a
3
4
foreign state is such a source shall include the
4
5
identity of the foreign state, agency, or
5
6
instrumentality that is the source of the funds. Such
6
7
certification shall be supplemented or corrected by
7
8
the producing party within thirty (30) days in the
8
9
event the certification becomes incomplete or
9
10
inaccurate in a material respect. A consumer
10
11
litigation funding agreement as defined in Section 3-
11
12
801 of Title 14A of the Oklahoma Statutes shall be
12
13
exempt from the provisions of this subparagraph.
13
14
d. If a commercial litigation funding agreement as
14
15
defined in Section 2 of this act, has been requested,
15
16
a party shall also produce, upon request pursuant to
16
17

Section 9:
Sections 3234 and 3236 of this title, a certification
17
18
by sworn affidavit by the producing party that
18
19
identifies whether the party is an entity controlled
19
20
by a foreign adversary. The certification shall also
20
21
include an admission or denial as to whether the party
21
22
is under the control or direction of an entity
22
23
controlled by a foreign adversary and whether the
23
24
party will allow access to any documents or
24
Req. No. 847 Page 6
1
information arising in the litigation not generally
1
2
available to the public to an entity controlled by a
2
3
foreign adversary. In the event that the producing
3
4
party admits that an entity controlled by a foreign
4
5
adversary may access any documents or information
5
6
arising in the litigation not generally available to
6
7
the public, the party shall specify the persons who
7
8
will have access to such documents or information.
8
9
Further, if the party receives funding pursuant to a
9
10
commercial litigation funding agreement as defined in
10
11

Section 10:
Section 2 of this act, the certification shall include
11
12
a statement that the funding was not sourced from an
12
13
entity controlled by a foreign adversary.
13
14

Section 11:
2. LIMITATIONS ON FREQUENCY AND EXTENT.
14
15
a. By order, the court may alter the limits on the length
15
16
of depositions under Section 3230 of this title, on
16
17
the number of interrogatories under Section 3233 of
17
18
this title, on the number of requests to produce under
18
19

Section 12:
Section 3234 of this title, or on the number of
19
20
requests for admission under Section 3236 of this
20
21
title.
21
22
b. A party is not required to provide discovery of
22
23
electronically stored information from sources that
23
24
the party identifies as not reasonably accessible
24
Req. No. 847 Page 7
1
because of undue burden or cost. On motion to compel
1
2
discovery or for a protective order, the party from
2
3
whom discovery is sought must show that the
3
4
information is not reasonably accessible because of
4
5
undue burden or cost. If that showing is made, the
5
6
court may order discovery from such sources if the
6
7
requesting party shows good cause, considering the
7
8
limitations of subparagraph c of this paragraph. The
8
9
court may specify conditions for the discovery.
9
10
c. On motion or on its own, the court shall limit the
10
11
frequency or extent of discovery otherwise allowed if
11
12
it determines that:
12
13
(1) the discovery sought is unreasonably cumulative
13
14
or duplicative, or can be obtained from some
14
15
other source that is more convenient, less
15
16
burdensome, or less expensive,
16
17
(2) the party seeking discovery has had ample
17
18
opportunity to obtain the information by
18
19
discovery in the action, or
19
20
(3) the proposed discovery is outside the scope
20
21
permitted by subparagraph a of paragraph 1 of
21
22
this subsection.
22
23
d. If an officer, director or managing agent of a
23
24
corporation or a government official is served with
24
Req. No. 847 Page 8
1
notice of a deposition or subpoena regarding a matter
1
2
about which he or she has no knowledge, he or she may
2
3
submit at a reasonable time prior to the date of the
3
4
deposition an affidavit to the noticing party so
4
5
stating and identifying a person within the
5
6
corporation or government entity who has knowledge of
6
7
the subject matter involved in the pending action.
7
8
Notwithstanding such affidavit, the noticing party may
8
9
proceed with the deposition, subject to the noticed
9
10
witness’s right to seek a protective order.
10
11

Section 13:
3. TRIAL PREPARATION: MATERIALS.
11
12
a. Unless as provided by paragraph 4 of this subsection,
12
13
a party may not discover documents and tangible things
13
14
that are prepared in anticipation of litigation or for
14
15
trial by or for another party or its representative,
15
16
including the other party’s attorney, consultant,
16
17
surety, indemnitor, insurer or agent. Subject to
17
18
paragraph 4 of this subsection, such materials may be
18
19
discovered if:
19
20
(1) they are otherwise discoverable under paragraph 1
20
21
of this subsection, and
21
22
(2) the party shows that it has substantial need for
22
23
the materials to prepare its case and cannot,
23
24
24
Req. No. 847 Page 9
1
without undue hardship, obtain their substantial
1
2
equivalent by other means.
2
3
b. If the court orders discovery of such materials, the
3
4
court shall protect against disclosure of the mental
4
5
impressions, conclusions, opinions or legal theories
5
6
of a party’s attorney or other representative
6
7
concerning the litigation.
7
8
c. A party or other person may, upon request and without
8
9
the required showing, obtain the person’s own previous
9
10
statement about the action or its subject matter. If
10
11
the request is refused, the person may move for a
11
12
court order, and the provisions of paragraph 4 of
12
13
subsection A of Section 3237 of this title apply to
13
14
the award of expenses. A previous statement is
14
15
either:
15
16
(1) a written statement that the person has signed or
16
17
otherwise adopted or approved, or
17
18
(2) a contemporaneous stenographic, mechanical,
18
19
electrical, or other recording, or a
19
20
transcription thereof, which recites
20
21
substantially verbatim the person’s oral
21
22
statement.
22
23

Section 14:
4. TRIAL PREPARATION: EXPERTS.
23
24
24
Req. No. 847 Page 10
1
a. Discovery of facts known and opinions held by experts,
1
2
otherwise discoverable under the provisions of
2
3
paragraph 1 of this subsection and acquired or
3
4
developed in anticipation of litigation or for trial,
4
5
may be obtained only as follows:
5
6
(1) a party may, through interrogatories, require any
6
7
other party to identify each person whom that
7
8
other party expects to call as an expert witness
8
9
at trial and give the address at which that
9
10
expert witness may be located,
10
11
(2) after disclosure of the names and addresses of
11
12
the expert witnesses, the other party expects to
12
13
call as witnesses, the party, who has requested
13
14
disclosure, may depose any such expert witnesses
14
15
subject to scope of this section. Prior to
15
16
taking the deposition the party must give notice
16
17
as required in subsections A and C of Section
17
18
3230 of this title, and
18
19
(3) in addition to taking the depositions of expert
19

20
21
require the party who expects to call the expert
21
22
witnesses to state the subject matter on which
22
23
each expert witness is expected to testify; the
23
24
substance of the facts and opinions to which the
24
Req. No. 847 Page 11
1
expert is expected to testify and a summary of
1
2
the grounds for each opinion; the qualifications
2
3
of each expert witness, including a list of all
3
4
publications authored by the expert witness
4
5
within the preceding ten (10) years; the
5
6
compensation to be paid to the expert witness for
6
7
the testimony and preparation for the testimony;
7
8
and a listing of any other cases in which the
8
9
expert witness has testified as an expert at
9
10
trial or by deposition within the preceding four
10
11
(4) years. An interrogatory seeking the
11
12
information specified above shall be treated as a
12
13
single interrogatory for purposes of the
13
14
limitation on the number of interrogatories in
14
15

Section 15:
Section 3233 of this title.
15
16
b. The protection provided by paragraph 3 of this
16
17
subsection extends to communications between the
17
18
party’s attorney and any expert witness retained or
18
19
specially employed to provide expert testimony in the
19
20
case or whose duties as the party’s employee regularly
20
21
involve giving expert testimony, except to the extent
21
22
that the communications:
22
23
(1) relate to compensation for the expert’s study or
23
24
testimony,
24
Req. No. 847 Page 12
1
(2) identify facts or data that the party’s attorney
1
2
provided and that the expert considered in
2
3
forming the opinions to be expressed, or
3
4
(3) identify assumptions that the party’s attorney
4
5
provided and that the expert relied upon in
5
6
forming the opinions to be expressed.
6
7
c. A party may not, by interrogatories or deposition,
7
8
discover facts known or opinions held by an expert who
8
9
has been retained or specially employed by another
9
10
party in anticipation of litigation or to prepare for
10
11
trial and who is not expected to be called as a
11
12
witness at trial, except as provided in Section 3235
12
13
of this title or upon a showing of exceptional
13
14
circumstances under which it is impracticable for the
14
15
party to obtain facts or opinions on the same subject
15
16
by other means.
16
17
d. Unless manifest injustice would result:
17
18
(1) the court shall require that the party seeking
18
19
discovery pay the expert a reasonable fee for
19
20
time spent in responding to discovery under
20
21
division (2) of subparagraph a of this paragraph
21
22
and subparagraph c of this paragraph, and
22
23
(2) the court shall require that the party seeking
23
24
discovery with respect to discovery obtained
24
Req. No. 847 Page 13
1
under subparagraph c of this paragraph, pay the

4
in obtaining facts and opinions from the expert.

Section 16:
5. CLAIMS OF PRIVILEGE OR PROTECTION OF TRIAL PREPARATION
5
6
MATERIALS.
6
7
a. When a party withholds information otherwise
7
8
discoverable under the Oklahoma Discovery Code by
8
9
claiming that it is privileged or subject to
9
10
protection as trial preparation material, the party
10
11
shall make the claim expressly and shall describe the
11
12
nature of the documents, communications, or things not
12
13
produced or disclosed in a manner that, without
13
14
revealing information itself privileged or protected,
14
15
will enable other parties to assess the applicability
15
16
of the privilege or protection.
16
17
b. If information produced in discovery is subject to a
17
18
claim of privilege or of protection as trial
18
19
preparation material, the party making the claim may
19
20
notify any party that received the information of the
20
21
claim and the basis for it. After being notified, a
21
22
party shall promptly return, sequester, or destroy the
22
23
specified information and any copies the party has;
23
24
shall not use or disclose the information until the
24
Req. No. 847 Page 14
1
claim is resolved; shall take reasonable steps to
1
2
retrieve the information if the party has disclosed it
2
3
before being notified; and may promptly present the
3
4
information to the court under seal for a
4
5
determination of the claim. The producing party shall
5
6
preserve the information until the claim is resolved.
6
7
This mechanism is procedural only and does not alter
7
8
the standards governing whether the information is
8
9
privileged or subject to protection as trial
9
10
preparation material or whether such privilege or
10
11
protection has been waived.
11
12
C. PROTECTIVE ORDERS.

13

Section 17:

23
24
24
Req. No. 847 Page 18

admission if the party obtains information upon the basis of which:

F. DISCOVERY CONFERENCE. At any time after commencement of an
7
8
action, the court may direct the attorneys for the parties to appear
8
9
for a conference on the subject of discovery. The court shall do so
9
10
upon motion by the attorney for any party if the motion includes:
10
11

Section 27:
1. A statement of the issues as they then appear;
11
12

Section 28:
2. A proposed plan and schedule of discovery;

13
14

Section 30:
4. Any other proposed orders with respect to discovery; and

15
16
made a reasonable effort to reach agreement with opposing attorneys
16
17
on the matters set forth in the motion.
17
18
Each party and his attorney are under a duty to participate in
18
19
good faith in the framing of a discovery plan if a plan is proposed
19
20
by the attorney for any party. Notice of the motion shall be served
20
21
on all parties. Objections or additions to matters set forth in the

Following the discovery conference, the court shall enter an
1
2
order tentatively identifying the issues for discovery purposes,
2
3
establishing a plan and schedule for discovery, setting limitations
3
4
on discovery, if any; and determining such other matters, including
4
5
the allocation of expenses, as are necessary for the proper
5
6
management of discovery in the action. In preparing the plan for
6
7
discovery the court shall protect the parties from excessive or
7
8
abusive use of discovery. An order shall be altered or amended
8
9
whenever justice so requires.
9
10
Subject to the right of a party who properly moves for a
10
11
discovery conference to prompt convening of the conference, the
11
12
court may combine the discovery conference with a pretrial
12
13
conference.
13

15
Every request for discovery, response or objection thereto made by a

16
party represented by an attorney shall be signed by at least one of
16
17
the party’s attorneys of record in the party’s individual name whose
17
18
address shall be stated. A party who is not represented by an
18
19
attorney shall sign the request, response or objection and state the
19
20
party’s address. The signature of the attorney or party constitutes
20
21
a certification that the party has read the request, response or
21
22
objection, and that it is:
22
23

1. To the best of the party’s knowledge, information and belief
23
24
formed after a reasonable inquiry consistent with the Oklahoma
24
Req. No. 847 Page 21

1
2
argument for the extension, modification or reversal of existing
2
3
law;
3
4

Section 33:
2. Interposed in good faith and not primarily to cause delay or
4
5
for any other improper purpose; and
5
6

Section 34:
3. Not unreasonable or unduly burdensome or expensive, given
6
7
the nature and complexity of the case, the discovery already had in
7
8
the case, the amount in controversy, and other values at stake in
8
9
the litigation. If a request, response or objection is not signed,
9
10
it shall be deemed ineffective.
10
11
If a certification is made in violation of the provisions of
11
12
this subsection, the court, upon motion or upon its own initiative,
12
13
shall impose upon the person who made the certification, the party
13
14
on whose behalf the request, response or objection is made, or both,
14
15
an appropriate sanction, which may include an order to pay to the
15
16
amount of the reasonable expenses occasioned thereby, including a
16
17
reasonable attorney fee.

10
11
order of the court in accordance with the Oklahoma Discovery Code,
11
12
the scope of discovery is as follows:
12
13
1. IN GENERAL.
13
14
a. Parties may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not
14
15
privileged, which is relevant to any party’s claim or
15
16
defense, reasonably calculated to lead to the
16
17
discovery of admissible evidence and proportional to
17
18
the needs of the case, considering the importance of
18
19
the issues at stake in the action, the amount in
19
20
controversy, the parties’ relative access to relevant
20
21
information, the parties’ resources, the importance of
21
22
the discovery in resolving the issues, and whether the
22
23
burden or expense of the proposed discovery outweighs
23
24
its likely benefit. Information within this scope of
24
Req. No. 847 Page 4

1
discovery need not be admissible in evidence to be
1
2
discoverable.
2
3
b. A party shall produce upon request pursuant to Section
3
4
3234 of this title, any insurance agreement under
4
5
which any person carrying on an insurance business may
5
6
be liable to satisfy part or all of a judgment which
6
7
may be entered in the action or to indemnify or
7
8
reimburse for payments made to satisfy the judgment.
8
9
Information concerning the insurance agreement is not
9
10
by reason of disclosure admissible in evidence at
10
11
trial. For purposes of this section, an application
11
12
for insurance shall not be treated as a part of an
12
13
insurance agreement.
13
14
c. A party shall produce upon request, pursuant to
14
15
Section 3234 of this title, any commercial litigation
15
16
funding agreement as defined in Section 2 of this act.
16
17
Information related to the commercial litigation
17
18
funding agreement is not by reason of disclosure
18
19
admissible as evidence at trial. Production of a
19
20
commercial litigation funding agreement shall include
20
21
a certification by sworn affidavit by the producing
21
22
party as to whether any funds encumbered by the terms
22
23
of the agreement have been or will be sourced from a
23
24
foreign state or agency or instrumentality of a
24
Req. No. 847 Page 5

1
foreign state as defined in 28 U.S.C., Section 1603,
1
2
as amended. Certification that discloses that a
2
3
foreign state or agency or instrumentality of a
3
4
foreign state is such a source shall include the
4
5
identity of the foreign state, agency, or
5
6
instrumentality that is the source of the funds. Such
6
7
certification shall be supplemented or corrected by
7
8
the producing party within thirty (30) days in the
8
9
event the certification becomes incomplete or
9
10
inaccurate in a material respect. A consumer
10
11
litigation funding agreement as defined in Section 3-
11
12
801 of Title 14A of the Oklahoma Statutes shall be
12
13
exempt from the provisions of this subparagraph.
13
14
d. If a commercial litigation funding agreement as
14
15
defined in Section 2 of this act, has been requested,
15
16
a party shall also produce, upon request pursuant to
16
17
Sections 3234 and 3236 of this title, a certification
17
18
by sworn affidavit by the producing party that
18
19
identifies whether the party is an entity controlled
19
20
by a foreign adversary. The certification shall also
20
21
include an admission or denial as to whether the party
21
22
is under the control or direction of an entity
22
23
controlled by a foreign adversary and whether the
23
24
party will allow access to any documents or
24
Req. No. 847 Page 6

1
information arising in the litigation not generally
1
2
available to the public to an entity controlled by a
2
3
foreign adversary. In the event that the producing
3
4
party admits that an entity controlled by a foreign
4
5
adversary may access any documents or information
5
6
arising in the litigation not generally available to
6
7
the public, the party shall specify the persons who
7
8
will have access to such documents or information.
8
9
Further, if the party receives funding pursuant to a
9
10
commercial litigation funding agreement as defined in
10
11
Section 2 of this act, the certification shall include
11
12
a statement that the funding was not sourced from an
12
13
entity controlled by a foreign adversary.
13
14
2. LIMITATIONS ON FREQUENCY AND EXTENT.
14
15
a. By order, the court may alter the limits on the length

22
b. A party is not required to provide discovery of
22
23
electronically stored information from sources that
23
24
the party identifies as not reasonably accessible
24
Req. No. 847 Page 7

1
because of undue burden or cost. On motion to compel
1
2
discovery or for a protective order, the party from
2
3
whom discovery is sought must show that the
3
4
information is not reasonably accessible because of
4
5
undue burden or cost. If that showing is made, the
5
6
court may order discovery from such sources if the
6
7
requesting party shows good cause, considering the
7
8
limitations of subparagraph c of this paragraph. The
8
9
court may specify conditions for the discovery.
9
10
c. On motion or on its own, the court shall limit the
10
11
frequency or extent of discovery otherwise allowed if
11
12
it determines that:
12
13
(1) the discovery sought is unreasonably cumulative
13
14
or duplicative, or can be obtained from some
14
15
other source that is more convenient, less
15
16
burdensome, or less expensive,
16
17
(2) the party seeking discovery has had ample
17
18
opportunity to obtain the information by
18
19
discovery in the action, or
19
20
(3) the proposed discovery is outside the scope
20
21
permitted by subparagraph a of paragraph 1 of
21
22
this subsection.
22
23
d. If an officer, director or managing agent of a
23
24
corporation or a government official is served with
24
Req. No. 847 Page 8

1
notice of a deposition or subpoena regarding a matter
1
2
about which he or she has no knowledge, he or she may
2
3
submit at a reasonable time prior to the date of the
3
4
deposition an affidavit to the noticing party so
4
5
stating and identifying a person within the
5
6
corporation or government entity who has knowledge of
6
7
the subject matter involved in the pending action.
7
8
Notwithstanding such affidavit, the noticing party may
8
9
proceed with the deposition, subject to the noticed
9
10
witness’s right to seek a protective order.
10
11
3. TRIAL PREPARATION: MATERIALS.
11
12
a. Unless as provided by paragraph 4 of this subsection,
12
13
a party may not discover documents and tangible things
13
14
that are prepared in anticipation of litigation or for
14
15
trial by or for another party or its representative,
15
16
including the other party’s attorney, consultant,
16
17
surety, indemnitor, insurer or agent. Subject to
17
18
paragraph 4 of this subsection, such materials may be
18
19
discovered if:
19
20
(1) they are otherwise discoverable under paragraph 1
20
21
of this subsection, and
21
22
(2) the party shows that it has substantial need for
22
23
the materials to prepare its case and cannot,
23
24
24
Req. No. 847 Page 9

1
without undue hardship, obtain their substantial
1
2
equivalent by other means.
2
3
b. If the court orders discovery of such materials, the
3
4
court shall protect against disclosure of the mental
4
5
impressions, conclusions, opinions or legal theories
5
6
of a party’s attorney or other representative
6
7
concerning the litigation.
7
8
c. A party or other person may, upon request and without
8
9
the required showing, obtain the person’s own previous
9
10
statement about the action or its subject matter. If
10
11
the request is refused, the person may move for a
11
12
court order, and the provisions of paragraph 4 of
12
13
subsection A of Section 3237 of this title apply to
13
14
the award of expenses. A previous statement is
14
15
either:
15
16
(1) a written statement that the person has signed or
16
17
otherwise adopted or approved, or
17
18
(2) a contemporaneous stenographic, mechanical,
18
19
electrical, or other recording, or a
19
20
transcription thereof, which recites
20
21
substantially verbatim the person’s oral
21
22
statement.
22
23
4. TRIAL PREPARATION: EXPERTS.
23
24
24
Req. No. 847 Page 10

1
a. Discovery of facts known and opinions held by experts,
1
2
otherwise discoverable under the provisions of
2
3
paragraph 1 of this subsection and acquired or
3
4
developed in anticipation of litigation or for trial,
4
5
may be obtained only as follows:
5
6
(1) a party may, through interrogatories, require any
6
7
other party to identify each person whom that
7
8
other party expects to call as an expert witness
8
9
at trial and give the address at which that
9
10
expert witness may be located,
10
11
(2) after disclosure of the names and addresses of
11
12
the expert witnesses, the other party expects to
12
13
call as witnesses, the party, who has requested
13
14
disclosure, may depose any such expert witnesses
14
15
subject to scope of this section. Prior to
15
16
taking the deposition the party must give notice
16
17
as required in subsections A and C of Section
17
18
3230 of this title, and
18
19
(3) in addition to taking the depositions of expert
19
20
witnesses the party may, through interrogatories,
20
21
require the party who expects to call the expert
21
22
witnesses to state the subject matter on which
22
23
each expert witness is expected to testify; the
23
24
substance of the facts and opinions to which the
24
Req. No. 847 Page 11

1
expert is expected to testify and a summary of
1
2
the grounds for each opinion; the qualifications
2
3
of each expert witness, including a list of all
3
4
publications authored by the expert witness
4
5
within the preceding ten (10) years; the
5
6
compensation to be paid to the expert witness for
6
7
the testimony and preparation for the testimony;
7
8
and a listing of any other cases in which the
8
9
expert witness has testified as an expert at
9
10
trial or by deposition within the preceding four
10
11
(4) years. An interrogatory seeking the
11
12
information specified above shall be treated as a
12
13
single interrogatory for purposes of the
13
14
limitation on the number of interrogatories in
14
15
Section 3233 of this title.
15
16
b. The protection provided by paragraph 3 of this
16
17
subsection extends to communications between the
17
18
party’s attorney and any expert witness retained or
18
19
specially employed to provide expert testimony in the
19
20
case or whose duties as the party’s employee regularly
20
21
involve giving expert testimony, except to the extent
21
22
that the communications:
22
23
(1) relate to compensation for the expert’s study or
23
24
testimony,
24
Req. No. 847 Page 12

1
(2) identify facts or data that the party’s attorney
1
2
provided and that the expert considered in
2
3
forming the opinions to be expressed, or
3
4
(3) identify assumptions that the party’s attorney
4
5
provided and that the expert relied upon in
5
6
forming the opinions to be expressed.
6
7
c. A party may not, by interrogatories or deposition,
7
8
discover facts known or opinions held by an expert who
8
9
has been retained or specially employed by another
9
10
party in anticipation of litigation or to prepare for
10
11
trial and who is not expected to be called as a
11
12
witness at trial, except as provided in Section 3235
12
13
of this title or upon a showing of exceptional
13
14
circumstances under which it is impracticable for the
14
15
party to obtain facts or opinions on the same subject
15
16
by other means.
16
17
d. Unless manifest injustice would result:
17
18
(1) the court shall require that the party seeking
18
19
discovery pay the expert a reasonable fee for
19
20
time spent in responding to discovery under
20
21
division (2) of subparagraph a of this paragraph
21
22
and subparagraph c of this paragraph, and
22
23
(2) the court shall require that the party seeking
23
24
discovery with respect to discovery obtained
24
Req. No. 847 Page 13

1
under subparagraph c of this paragraph, pay the
1
2
other party a fair portion of the fees and
2
3
expenses reasonably incurred by the latter party
3
4
in obtaining facts and opinions from the expert.

5. CLAIMS OF PRIVILEGE OR PROTECTION OF TRIAL PREPARATION
5
6
MATERIALS.
6
7
a. When a party withholds information otherwise
7
8
discoverable under the Oklahoma Discovery Code by
8
9
claiming that it is privileged or subject to
9
10
protection as trial preparation material, the party
10
11
shall make the claim expressly and shall describe the
11
12
nature of the documents, communications, or things not
12
13
produced or disclosed in a manner that, without
13
14
revealing information itself privileged or protected,
14
15
will enable other parties to assess the applicability
15
16
of the privilege or protection.
16
17
b. If information produced in discovery is subject to a
17
18
claim of privilege or of protection as trial
18
19
preparation material, the party making the claim may
19
20
notify any party that received the information of the
20
21
claim and the basis for it. After being notified, a
21
22
party shall promptly return, sequester, or destroy the
22
23
specified information and any copies the party has;
23
24
shall not use or disclose the information until the
24
Req. No. 847 Page 14

1
claim is resolved; shall take reasonable steps to
1
2
retrieve the information if the party has disclosed it
2
3
before being notified; and may promptly present the
3
4
information to the court under seal for a
4
5
determination of the claim. The producing party shall
5
6
preserve the information until the claim is resolved.
6
7
This mechanism is procedural only and does not alter
7
8
the standards governing whether the information is
8
9
privileged or subject to protection as trial
9
10
preparation material or whether such privilege or
10
11
protection has been waived.
11
12
C. PROTECTIVE ORDERS.
12
13
1. Upon motion by a party or by the person from whom discovery
13
14
is sought, accompanied by a certification that the movant has in
14
15
good faith conferred or attempted to confer, either in person or by
15
16
telephone, with other affected parties in an effort to resolve the
16
17
dispute without court action, and for good cause shown, the court in
17
18
which the action is pending or on matters relating to a deposition,
18
19
the district court in the county where the deposition is to be taken
19
20
may enter any order which justice requires to protect a party or
20
21
person from annoyance, harassment, embarrassment, oppression or
21
22
undue delay, burden or expense, including one or more of the
22
23
following:
23
24
a. that the discovery not be had,
24
Req. No. 847 Page 15

1
b. that the discovery may be had only on specified terms
1
2
and conditions, including a designation of the time,
2
3
place or the allocation of expenses,
3
4
c. that the discovery may be had only by a method of
4
5
discovery other than that selected by the party
5
6
seeking discovery,
6
7
d. that certain matters not be inquired into, or that the
7
8
scope of the disclosure or discovery be limited to
8
9
certain matters,
9
10
e. that discovery be conducted with no one present except
10
11
persons designated by the court,
11
12
f. that a deposition after being sealed be opened only by
12
13
order of the court,
13
14
g. that a trade secret or other confidential research,
14
15
development or commercial information not be disclosed
15
16
or be disclosed only in a designated way, and
16
17
h. that the parties simultaneously file specified
17
18
documents or information enclosed in sealed envelopes
18
19
to be opened as directed by the court.
19
20
2. If the motion for a protective order is denied in whole or
20
21
in part, the court may, on such terms and conditions as are just,
21
22
order that any party or person provide or permit discovery. The
22
23
provisions of paragraph 4 of subsection A of Section 3237 of this
23
24
title apply to the award of expenses incurred in relation to the
24
Req. No. 847 Page 16

1
motion. Any protective order of the court which has the effect of
1
2
removing any material obtained by discovery from the public record
2
3
shall contain the following:
3
4
a. a statement that the court has determined it is
4
5
necessary in the interests of justice to remove the
5
6
material from the public record,
6
7
b. specific identification of the material which is to be
7
8
removed or withdrawn from the public record, or which
8
9
is to be filed but not placed in the public record,
9
10
and
10
11
c. a requirement that any party obtaining a protective
11
12
order place the protected material in a sealed manila
12
13
envelope clearly marked with the caption and case
13
14
number and is clearly marked with the word
14
15
“CONFIDENTIAL”, and stating the date the order was
15
16
entered and the name of the judge entering the order.
16
17
This requirement may also be satisfied by requiring
17
18
the party to file the documents pursuant to the
18
19
procedure for electronically filing sealed or
19
20
confidential documents approved for electronic filing
20
21
in the courts of this state.
21
22
3. No protective order entered after the filing and
22
23
microfilming of documents of any kind shall be construed to require
23
24
the microfilm record of such filing to be amended in any fashion.
24
Req. No. 847 Page 17

1
4. The party or counsel which has received the protective order
1
2
shall be responsible for promptly presenting the order to
2
3
appropriate court clerk personnel for appropriate action.
3
4
5. All documents produced or testimony given under a protective
4
5
order shall be retained in the office of counsel until required by
5
6
the court to be filed in the case.
6
7
6. Counsel for the respective parties shall be responsible for
7
8
informing witnesses, as necessary, of the contents of the protective
8
9
order.
9
10
7. When a case is filed in which a party intends to seek a
10
11
protective order removing material from the public record, the
11
12
plaintiff(s) and defendant(s) shall be initially designated on the
12
13
petition under pseudonym such as “John or Jane Doe”, or “Roe”, and
13
14
the petition shall clearly indicate that the party designations are
14
15
fictitious. The party seeking confidentiality or other order
15
16
removing the case, in whole or in part, from the public record,
16
17
shall immediately present application to the court, seeking
17
18
instructions for the conduct of the case, including confidentiality
18
19
of the records.
19
20
D. SEQUENCE AND TIMING OF DISCOVERY. Unless the parties
20
21
stipulate or the court orders otherwise for the convenience of
21
22
parties and witnesses and in the interests of justice, methods of
22
23
discovery may be used in any sequence. The fact that a party is
23
24
24
Req. No. 847 Page 18

1
conducting discovery, whether by deposition or otherwise, shall not
1
2
operate to delay discovery by any other party.
2
3
E. SUPPLEMENTATION OF RESPONSES. A party who has responded to
3
4
a request for discovery with a response that was complete when it
4
5
was made is under no duty to supplement the response to include
5
6
information thereafter acquired, except as follows:
6
7
1. A party is under a duty seasonably to supplement the
7
8
response with respect to any question directly addressed to:
8
9
a. the identity and location of persons having knowledge
9
10
of discoverable matters, and
10
11
b. the identity of each person expected to be called as
11
12
an expert witness at trial, the subject matter on
12
13
which the person is expected to testify, and the
13
14
substance of the testimony of the person;
14
15
2. A party is under a duty seasonably to amend a prior response
15
16
to an interrogatory, request for production, or request for
16
17
admission if the party obtains information upon the basis of which:
17
18
a. (1) the party knows that the response was incorrect
18
19
in some material respect when made, or
19
20
(2) the party knows that the response, which was
20
21
correct when made, is no longer true in some
21
22
material respect, and
22
23
23
24
24
Req. No. 847 Page 19

1
b. the additional or corrective information has not
1
2
otherwise been made known to the other parties during
2
3
the discovery process or in writing; and
3
4
3. A duty to supplement responses may be imposed by order of
4
5
the court, agreement of the parties, or at any time prior to trial
5
6
through new requests for supplementation of prior responses.
6
7
F. DISCOVERY CONFERENCE. At any time after commencement of an
7
8
action, the court may direct the attorneys for the parties to appear
8
9
for a conference on the subject of discovery. The court shall do so
9
10
upon motion by the attorney for any party if the motion includes:
10
11
1. A statement of the issues as they then appear;
11
12
2. A proposed plan and schedule of discovery;
12
13
3. Any limitations proposed to be placed on discovery;
13
14
4. Any other proposed orders with respect to discovery; and
14
15
5. A statement showing that the attorney making the motion has
15
16
made a reasonable effort to reach agreement with opposing attorneys
16
17
on the matters set forth in the motion.
17
18
Each party and his attorney are under a duty to participate in
18
19
good faith in the framing of a discovery plan if a plan is proposed
19
20
by the attorney for any party. Notice of the motion shall be served
20
21
on all parties. Objections or additions to matters set forth in the
21
22
motion shall be served not later than ten (10) days after service of
22
23
the motion.
23
24
24
Req. No. 847 Page 20

1
Following the discovery conference, the court shall enter an
1
2
order tentatively identifying the issues for discovery purposes,
2
3
establishing a plan and schedule for discovery, setting limitations
3
4
on discovery, if any; and determining such other matters, including
4
5
the allocation of expenses, as are necessary for the proper
5
6
management of discovery in the action. In preparing the plan for
6
7
discovery the court shall protect the parties from excessive or
7
8
abusive use of discovery. An order shall be altered or amended
8
9
whenever justice so requires.
9
10
Subject to the right of a party who properly moves for a
10
11
discovery conference to prompt convening of the conference, the
11
12
court may combine the discovery conference with a pretrial
12
13
conference.
13
14
G. SIGNING OF DISCOVERY REQUESTS, RESPONSES AND OBJECTIONS.
14
15
Every request for discovery, response or objection thereto made by a
15
16
party represented by an attorney shall be signed by at least one of
16
17
the party’s attorneys of record in the party’s individual name whose
17
18
address shall be stated. A party who is not represented by an
18
19
attorney shall sign the request, response or objection and state the
19
20
party’s address. The signature of the attorney or party constitutes
20
21
a certification that the party has read the request, response or
21
22
objection, and that it is:
22
23
1. To the best of the party’s knowledge, information and belief
23
24
formed after a reasonable inquiry consistent with the Oklahoma
24
Req. No. 847 Page 21

1
Discovery Code and warranted by existing law or a good faith
1
2
argument for the extension, modification or reversal of existing
2
3
law;
3
4
2. Interposed in good faith and not primarily to cause delay or
4
5
for any other improper purpose; and
5
6
3. Not unreasonable or unduly burdensome or expensive, given
6
7
the nature and complexity of the case, the discovery already had in
7
8
the case, the amount in controversy, and other values at stake in
8
9
the litigation. If a request, response or objection is not signed,
9
10
it shall be deemed ineffective.
10
11
If a certification is made in violation of the provisions of
11
12
this subsection, the court, upon motion or upon its own initiative,
12
13
shall impose upon the person who made the certification, the party
13
14
on whose behalf the request, response or objection is made, or both,
14
15
an appropriate sanction, which may include an order to pay to the
15
16
amount of the reasonable expenses occasioned thereby, including a
16
17
reasonable attorney fee.
17
18
SECTION 2. NEW LAW A new section of law to be codified
18
19
in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 3226.2 of Title 12, unless there
19
20
is created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:
20
21
As used in the Oklahoma Discovery Code:
21
22
1. “Commercial litigation funder” means any person or entity,
22
23
other than an attorney permitted to charge a contingent fee
23
24
representing a party, that enters into a contract establishing a
24
Req. No. 847 Page 22

1
right to receive compensation that is contingent on and sourced from
1
2
any proceeds of the civil action by settlement, judgment, or
2
3
otherwise. Commercial litigation funder shall not include a
3
4
consumer litigation funder as defined in Section 3-801 of Title 14A
4
5
of the Oklahoma Statutes;
5
6
2. “Commercial litigation funding agreement” means an agreement
6
7
under which the commercial litigation funder is granted a right to
7
8
receive compensation contingent on and sourced from any proceeds of
8
9
a civil action by settlement, judgment, or otherwise. A commercial
9
10
litigation funding agreement shall not include:
10
11
a. funding provided by an attorney to a client as
11
12
authorized by the Oklahoma Rules of Professional
12
13
Conduct, Appendix 3–A of Chapter 1 of Title 5 of the
13
14
Oklahoma Statutes, unless such funds are encumbered
14
15
pursuant to a commercial litigation funding agreement,
15
16
or
16
17
b. a consumer litigation funding agreement as defined in
17
18
Section 3-801 of Title 14A of the Oklahoma Statutes;
