Section 2:
SECTION 1. NEW LAW A new section of law not to be
14
15
codified in the Oklahoma Statutes reads as follows:
15
16
The Legislature of the State of Oklahoma finds and declares:
16
17

Section 3:
1. Direct-to-consumer (DTC) advertising has the potential to
17
18
exploit lay understanding of medical science, exposing the public to
18
19
persuasive marketing tactics that may compromise informed decision-
19
20
making, mislead consumers by underplaying risks, and cause undue
20
21
burden on physicians’ prescribing practices; and
21
22

Section 4:
2. Past instances of misleading DTC pharmaceutical advertising
22
23
have resulted in immense harm to public health such as the
23
24
aggressive advertising campaigns for OxyContin, Vioxx, and Zyprexa.
24
Req. No. 1438 Page 1
1
Purdue Pharma’s OxyContin advertising played a huge part in the
1
2
opioid addiction crisis and the company settled with the United
2
3
States Department of Justice for Eight Billion Three Hundred Million
3
4
Dollars ($8,300,000,000.00) for their role in 2020. In 2019, Purdue
4
5
settled with Oklahoma for Two Hundred Seventy Million Dollars
5
6
($270,000,000.00);
6
7

Section 5:
3. Newly approved medications advertised directly to consumers
7
8
may present unknown long-term risks, exposing patients to potential
8
9
harm, such as with the Vioxx debacle which resulted in Merck paying
9
10
Four Billion Eight Hundred Fifty Million Dollars ($4,850,000,000.00)
10
11
to end the lawsuits;
11
12

Section 6:
4. The United States is one of only two countries globally that
12
13
permits DTC pharmaceutical advertising. One hundred ninety-three
13
14
out of the world’s one hundred ninety-five countries do not permit
14
15
DTC pharmaceutical advertising. Prohibiting this practice would
15
16
align Oklahoma with the global norm;
16
17

Section 7:
5. The costs of advertising are frequently passed on to
17
18
consumers in a field where such advertising is not necessary, with
18
19
advertising budgets for some drugs in the hundreds of millions of
19
20
dollars, resulting in higher drug prices and imposing financial
20
21
burdens on patients and health care systems;
21
22

Section 8:
6. DTC advertising could compromise the integrity of the
22
23
doctor-patient relationship by creating improper pressure on doctors
23
24
to prescribe certain advertised medications. Banning DTC
24
Req. No. 1438 Page 2
1
pharmaceutical advertising would encourage better communication and
1
2
trust between patients and their health care providers, fostering
2
3
informed and responsible medical decision-making;
3
4

Section 9:
7. DTC advertising often prioritizes the promotion of lifestyle
4
5
medications over essential, life-saving drugs, distorting health
5
6
care priorities; and
6
7

Section 10:
8. DTC advertising promotes the over-medicalization of common
7
8
conditions, often urging consumers to pursue pharmacological
8
9
solutions over alternative treatments or lifestyle modifications.

10

Section 11:
