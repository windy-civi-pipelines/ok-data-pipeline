12
b. approved by the Southwest Power Pool, and
12
13
c. placed into service before December 31, 2013,
13
14
shall be presumed recoverable through a periodic adjustment in the
14
15
rates of the utility, provided that the presumption of the recovery
15
16
of such costs or the recovery of such costs through a periodic
16
17
adjustment in rates may be rebutted by evidence presented to the
17

Commission. The determination of whether the costs shall be

19
recovered and whether the costs shall be recovered through a
19
20
periodic adjustment of rates shall be made by the Commission

recovered by the utility shall be subject to Commission review and
