Dollar ($1.00) per copied page for a certified copy. However, if
1
2
the request:
2
3
a. is solely for commercial purpose, or
3
4
b. would clearly cause excessive disruption of the
4
5
essential functions of the public body,
5
6
then the public body may charge a reasonable fee to recover the
6
7
direct cost of record search and copying; however, publication in a

8
newspaper or broadcast by news media for news purposes shall not
8
9
constitute a resale or use of a record for trade or commercial
9
10
purpose and charges for providing copies of electronic data to the

news media for a news purpose shall not exceed the direct cost of

for a copy in a computerized format of a record of the Department

15
for the record is otherwise set by law. A public body may require
15
16
advance payment of the estimated fees authorized under this section
16
17
when the estimated costs of searching, redacting, or making a copy
17
18
of the record or records exceeds Seventy-five Dollars ($75.00). Any
18
19
portion of an advance payment that exceeds the costs of responding
19
20
to the request shall be returned to the requestor.
20
21
Any public body establishing fees under this act shall post a
21
22
written schedule of the fees at its principal office and with the
22
23
county clerk.
23
24
24
Req. No. 103 Page 10

1
In no case shall a search fee be charged when the release of
1
2
records is in the public interest, including, but not limited to,
2
3
release to the news media, scholars, authors and taxpayers seeking
3
4
to determine whether those entrusted with the affairs of the
4
5
government are honestly, faithfully, and competently performing
5
6
their duties as public servants.
6
7
The fees shall not be used for the purpose of discouraging
7
8
requests for information or as obstacles to disclosure of requested
8
9
information;
9
10
5. 6. The land description tract index of all recorded
10
11
instruments concerning real property required to be kept by the
11
12
county clerk of any county shall be available for inspection or
12
13
copying in accordance with the provisions of the Oklahoma Open
13
14
Records Act; provided, however, the index shall not be copied or
14
15
mechanically reproduced for the purpose of sale of the information;
15
16
6. 7. A public body must provide prompt, reasonable access to
16
17
its records but may establish reasonable procedures which protect
17
18
the integrity and organization of its records and to prevent
18
19
excessive disruptions of its essential functions. A delay in
19
20
providing access to records shall be limited solely to the time
20
21
required for preparing the requested documents and the avoidance of
21
22
excessive disruptions of the public body’s essential functions. In
22
23
no event may production of a current request for records be
23
24
unreasonably delayed until after completion of a prior records
24
Req. No. 103 Page 11

1
request that will take substantially longer than the current
1
2
request. Any public body which makes the requested records
2
3
available on the Internet shall meet the obligation of providing
3
4
prompt, reasonable access to its records as required by this
4
5
paragraph;
5
6
8. If a records request is unreasonably vague, open-ended, or
6
7
otherwise does not describe the requested records with reasonable
7
8
specificity, a public body may ask the requestor to clarify the
8
9
request. To have reasonable specificity, a request shall:
9
10
a. specify a general time frame within which the
10
11
requested records would have been created or
11
12
transmitted,
12
13
b. seek identifiable records, rather than general
13
14
information without any qualifiers or other
14
15
specifications, and
15
16
c. include search terms that are sufficiently specific to
16
17
avoid generating an unreasonably large number of
17
18
records, such as thousands of pages of emails.
18
19
If a public body has engaged with the requestor to seek the
19
20
information needed to fulfill the request and to reach a reasonable
20
21
solution that accommodates the interests of both the requestor and
21
22
the public body, including providing the requestor with general
22
23
topics of records related to the request, the request may be denied
23
24
24
Req. No. 103 Page 12

1
if it is still not reasonably specific and would excessively disrupt
1
2
the public body’s essential functions; and
2
3
7. 9. A public body shall designate certain persons who are
3
4
authorized to release records of the public body for inspection,
4
5
copying, or mechanical reproduction. At least one person shall be
5
6
available at all times to release records during the regular
6
7
business hours of the public body.

20
21
and denied prior to filing of the civil suit; and
21
22
2. If successful, shall be entitled to reasonable attorney fees
22
23
unless the court finds the public body or public official acted in

also be provided to the Attorney General.

7

8
civil suit and the court finds that the suit was clearly frivolous,

the public body or public official shall be entitled to reasonable
9
10
attorney fees.
10
11
