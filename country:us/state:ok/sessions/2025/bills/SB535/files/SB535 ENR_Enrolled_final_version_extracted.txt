page for a certified copy. However, if the request:

essential functions of the public body,

advance payment of the estimated fees authorized under this section
when the estimated cost exceeds Seventy-five Dollars ($75.00) or if
the requestor has outstanding fees from previous requests. Any
portion of an advance payment that exceeds the costs of responding
to the request shall be returned to the requestor.
Any public body establishing fees under this act the Oklahoma
Open Records Act shall post a written schedule of the fees at its
principal office and with the county clerk.
In no case shall a search fee be charged when the release of

release to the news media, scholars, authors and taxpayers seeking

government are honestly, faithfully, and competently performing
their duties as public servants.
The fees shall not be used for the purpose of discouraging
requests for information or as obstacles to disclosure of requested
information;
ENR. S. B. NO. 535 Page 7

Section 15:
5. The land description tract index of all recorded instruments
concerning real property required to be kept by the county clerk of

provided, however, the index shall not be copied or mechanically
reproduced for the purpose of sale of the information;

Section 16:
6. A public body must provide prompt, reasonable access to its
records but may establish reasonable procedures which protect the
integrity and organization of its records and to prevent excessive
disruptions of its essential functions. A delay in providing access
to records shall be limited solely to the time required for
preparing the requested documents and the avoidance of excessive
disruptions of the public body’s essential functions. In no event
may production of a current request for records be unreasonably
delayed until after completion of a prior records request that will
take substantially longer than the current request. Any public body
which makes the requested records available on the Internet shall
meet the obligation of providing prompt, reasonable access to its
records as required by this paragraph;

Section 17:
7. A public body may require a requestor to complete a records
request form. If a records request does not describe the requested
records with reasonable specificity, a public body may ask the
requestor to clarify the request. To have reasonable specificity, a
request shall:
a. specify a general time frame within which the
requested records would have been created or
transmitted,
b. seek identifiable records, rather than general
information without any qualifiers or other
specifications, and
c. include search terms that are sufficiently specific to
assist the public body in identifying the requested
records.
If a public body has engaged with the requestor to seek the
information needed to fulfill the request and to identify the
records sought by the requestor, including providing the requestor
ENR. S. B. NO. 535 Page 8
with general topics or a specific list of records related to the
request, the request may be denied if it is still not reasonably
specific; and

Section 18:
7. 8. A public body shall designate certain persons who are
authorized to release records of the public body for inspection,
copying, or mechanical reproduction. At least one person shall be
available at all times to release records during the regular
business hours of the public body.
