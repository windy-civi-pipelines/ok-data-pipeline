14 local provision to the contrary, in no instance shall the record
15 copying fee exceed twenty-five cents ($0.25) per page for records
16 having the dimensions of eight and one-half (8 1/2) by fourteen (14)
17 inches or smaller, or a maximum of One Dollar ($1.00) per copied
18 page for a certified copy. However, if the request:
19 a. is solely for commercial purpose, or
20 b. would clearly cause excessive disruption of the
21 essential functions of the public body,
22 then the public body may charge a reasonable fee to recover the
23 direct cost of record search and copying; however, publication in a
24 newspaper or broadcast by news media for news purposes shall not
Req. No. 13570 Page 9

4 making the copy. The fee charged by the Department of Public Safety
5 for a copy in a computerized format of a record of the Department
6 shall not exceed the direct cost of making the copy unless the fee
7 for the record is otherwise set by law. A public body may require
8 advance payment of the estimated fees authorized under this section
9 when the estimated cost exceeds Seventy-five Dollars ($75.00) or if
10 the requestor has outstanding fees from previous requests. Any
11 portion of an advance payment that exceeds the costs of responding
12 to the request shall be returned to the requestor.
13 Any public body establishing fees under this act the Oklahoma
14 Open Records Act shall post a written schedule of the fees at its
15 principal office and with the county clerk.
16 In no case shall a search fee be charged when the release of
17 records is in the public interest, including, but not limited to,
18 release to the news media, scholars, authors and taxpayers seeking
19 to determine whether those entrusted with the affairs of the
20 government are honestly, faithfully, and competently performing
21 their duties as public servants.
22 The fees shall not be used for the purpose of discouraging
23 requests for information or as obstacles to disclosure of requested
24 information;

1 5. The land description tract index of all recorded instruments
2 concerning real property required to be kept by the county clerk of
3 any county shall be available for inspection or copying in
4 accordance with the provisions of the Oklahoma Open Records Act;
5 provided, however, the index shall not be copied or mechanically
6 reproduced for the purpose of sale of the information;
7 6. A public body must provide prompt, reasonable access to its
8 records but may establish reasonable procedures which protect the
9 integrity and organization of its records and to prevent excessive
10 disruptions of its essential functions. A delay in providing access
11 to records shall be limited solely to the time required for
12 preparing the requested documents and the avoidance of excessive
13 disruptions of the public body’s essential functions. In no event
14 may production of a current request for records be unreasonably
15 delayed until after completion of a prior records request that will
16 take substantially longer than the current request. Any public body
17 which makes the requested records available on the Internet shall
18 meet the obligation of providing prompt, reasonable access to its
19 records as required by this paragraph;
20 7. A public body may require a requestor to complete a records
21 request form. If a records request does not describe the requested
22 records with reasonable specificity, a public body may ask the
23 requestor to clarify the request. To have reasonable specificity, a
24 request shall:
Req. No. 13570 Page 11
1 a. specify a general time frame within which the
2 requested records would have been created or
3 transmitted,
4 b. seek identifiable records, rather than general
5 information without any qualifiers or other
6 specifications, and
7 c. include search terms that are sufficiently specific to
8 assist the public body in identifying the requested
9 records.
10 If a public body has engaged with the requestor to seek the
11 information needed to fulfill the request and to identify the
12 records sought by the requestor, including providing the requestor
13 with general topics or a specific list of records related to the
14 request, the request may be denied if it is still not reasonably
15 specific; and
16 7. 8. A public body shall designate certain persons who are
17 authorized to release records of the public body for inspection,
18 copying, or mechanical reproduction. At least one person shall be
19 available at all times to release records during the regular
20 business hours of the public body.
21 SECTION 3. This act shall become effective November 1, 2025.

2 to assemble for the requesting person any criminal history records
3 relating to persons whose names, dates of birth, and other
4 identifying information required by the Oklahoma State Bureau of
5 Investigation pursuant to administrative rule are not furnished by
6 the requesting person;
7 4. Any request for a record which contains individual records
8 of persons, and the cost of copying, reproducing or certifying each
9 individual record is otherwise prescribed by state law, the cost may
10 be assessed for each individual record, or portion thereof requested
11 as prescribed by state law. Otherwise, a public body may charge a
12 fee only for recovery of the reasonable, direct costs of record
13 copying, or mechanical reproduction. Notwithstanding any state or
14 local provision to the contrary, in no instance shall the record
15 copying fee exceed twenty-five cents ($0.25) per page for records
16 having the dimensions of eight and one-half (8 1/2) by fourteen (14)
17 inches or smaller, or a maximum of One Dollar ($1.00) per copied
18 page for a certified copy. However, if the request:
19 a. is solely for commercial purpose, or
20 b. would clearly cause excessive disruption of the
21 essential functions of the public body,
22 then the public body may charge a reasonable fee to recover the
23 direct cost of record search and copying; however, publication in a
24 newspaper or broadcast by news media for news purposes shall not

1 cons titute a resale or use of a record for trade or commercial
2 purpose and charges for providing copies of electronic data to the
3 news media for a news purpose shall not exceed the direct cost of
4 making the copy. The fee charged by the Department of Public Safety
5 for a copy in a computerized format of a record of the Department
6 shall not exceed the direct cost of making the copy unless the fee
7 for the record is otherwise set by law. A public body may require
8 advance payment of the estimated fees authorized under this section
9 when the estimated cost exceeds Seventy-five Dollars ($75.00) or if
10 the requestor has outstanding fees from previous requests. Any
11 portion of an advance payment that exceeds the costs of responding
12 to the request shall be returned to the requestor.
13 Any public body establishing fees under this act the Oklahoma
14 Open Records Act shall post a written schedule of the fees at its
15 principal office and with the county clerk.
16 In no case shall a search fee be charged when the release of
17 records is in the public interest, including, but not limited to,
18 release to the news media, scholars, authors and taxpayers seeking
19 to determine whether those entrusted with the affairs of the
20 government are honestly, faithfully, and competently performing
21 their duties as public servants.
22 The fees shall not be used for the purpose of discouraging
23 requests for information or as obstacles to disclosure of requested
24 information;

1 5. The land description tract index of all recorded instruments
2 concerning real property required to be kept by the county clerk of
3 any county shall be available for inspection or copying in
4 accordance with the provisions of the Oklahoma Open Records Act;
5 provided, however, the index shall not be copied or mechanically
6 reproduced for the purpose of sale of the information;
7 6. A public body must provide prompt, reasonable access to its
8 records but may establish reasonable procedures which protect the
9 integrity and organization of its records and to prevent excessive
10 disruptions of its essential functions. A delay in providing access
11 to records shall be limited solely to the time required for
12 preparing the requested documents and the avoidance of excessive
13 disruptions of the public body’s essential functions. In no event
14 may production of a current request for records be unreasonably
15 delayed until after completion of a prior records request that will
16 take substantially longer than the current request. Any public body
17 which makes the requested records available on the Internet shall
18 meet the obligation of providing prompt, reasonable access to its
19 records as required by this paragraph;
20 7. A public body may require a requestor to complete a records
21 request form. If a records request does not describe the requested
22 records with reasonable specificity, a public body may ask the
23 requestor to clarify the request. To have reasonable specificity, a
24 request shall:
Req. No. 13570 Page 11

1 a. specify a general time frame within which the
2 requested records would have been created or
3 transmitted,
4 b. seek identifiable records, rather than general
5 information without any qualifiers or other
6 specifications, and
7 c. include search terms that are sufficiently specific to
8 assist the public body in identifying the requested
9 records.
10 If a public body has engaged with the requestor to seek the
11 information needed to fulfill the request and to identify the
12 records sought by the requestor, including providing the requestor
13 with general topics or a specific list of records related to the
14 request, the request may be denied if it is still not reasonably
15 specific; and
16 7. 8. A public body shall designate certain persons who are
17 authorized to release records of the public body for inspection,
18 copying, or mechanical reproduction. At least one person shall be
19 available at all times to release records during the regular
20 business hours of the public body.
21 SECTION 3. This act shall become effective November 1, 2025.
