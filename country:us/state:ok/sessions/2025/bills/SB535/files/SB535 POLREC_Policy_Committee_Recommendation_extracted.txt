14
principal office and with the county clerk.

In no case shall a search fee be charged when the release of

17
release to the news media, scholars, authors and taxpayers seeking
18
to determine whether those entrusted with the affairs of the
19
government are honestly, faithfully, and competently performing
20
their duties as public servants.

The fees shall not be used for the purpose of discouraging
22
requests for information or as obstacles to disclosure of requested
23
information;

5 provided, however, the index shall not be copied or mechanically
6 reproduced for the purpose of sale of the information;
7 6. A public body must provide prompt, reasonable access to its
8 records but may establish reasonable procedures which protect the
9 integrity and organization of its records and to prevent excessive
10 disruptions of its essential functions. A delay in providing access
11 to records shall be limited solely to the time required for
12 preparing the requested documents and the avoidance of excessive
13 disruptions of the public body’s essential functions. In no event
may production of a current request for records be unreasonably
14
delayed until after completion of a prior records request that will
15
take substantially longer than the current request. Any public body
16
which makes the requested records available on the Internet shall
17
meet the obligation of providing prompt, reasonable access to its
18
records as required by this paragraph;
19

Section 9:
7. A public body may require a requestor to complete a records
20
request form. If a records request does not describe the requested
21
records with reasonable specificity, a public body may ask the
22
requestor to clarify the request. To have reasonable specificity, a
23
request shall:
24
Req. No. 13490 Page 11
1 a. specify a general time frame within which the
2 requested records would have been created or
3 transmitted,
4 b. seek identifiable records, rather than general
5 information without any qualifiers or other
6 specifications, and
7 c. include search terms that are sufficiently specific to
8 assist the public body in identifying the requested
9 records.
10 If a public body has engaged with the requestor to seek the
11 information needed to fulfill the request and to identify the
12 records sought by the requestor, including providing the requestor
13 with general topics or a specific list of records related to the
request, the request may be denied if it is still not reasonably
14
specific; and
15

Section 10:
7. 8. A public body shall designate certain persons who are
16
authorized to release records of the public body for inspection,
17
copying, or mechanical reproduction. At least one person shall be
18
available at all times to release records during the regular
19
business hours of the public body.
20

Section 11:
SECTION 3. This act shall become effective November 1, 2025.

then the public body may charge a reasonable fee to recover the
22
direct cost of record search and copying; however, publication in a

9 when the estimated cost exceeds Seventy-five Dollars ($75.00) or if
10 the requestor has outstanding fees from previous requests. Any
11 portion of an advance payment that exceeds the costs of responding

6 reproduced for the purpose of sale of the information;
7 6. A public body must provide prompt, reasonable access to its
8 records but may establish reasonable procedures which protect the
9 integrity and organization of its records and to prevent excessive
10 disruptions of its essential functions. A delay in providing access
11 to records shall be limited solely to the time required for
12 preparing the requested documents and the avoidance of excessive
13 disruptions of the public body’s essential functions. In no event
may production of a current request for records be unreasonably
14
delayed until after completion of a prior records request that will
15
take substantially longer than the current request. Any public body
16
which makes the requested records available on the Internet shall
17
meet the obligation of providing prompt, reasonable access to its
18
records as required by this paragraph;
19
7. A public body may require a requestor to complete a records
20
request form. If a records request does not describe the requested
21
records with reasonable specificity, a public body may ask the
22
requestor to clarify the request. To have reasonable specificity, a
23
request shall:
24
Req. No. 13490 Page 11

1 a. specify a general time frame within which the
2 requested records would have been created or
3 transmitted,
4 b. seek identifiable records, rather than general
5 information without any qualifiers or other
6 specifications, and
7 c. include search terms that are sufficiently specific to
8 assist the public body in identifying the requested
9 records.
10 If a public body has engaged with the requestor to seek the
11 information needed to fulfill the request and to identify the
12 records sought by the requestor, including providing the requestor
13 with general topics or a specific list of records related to the
request, the request may be denied if it is still not reasonably
14
specific; and
15
7. 8. A public body shall designate certain persons who are
16
authorized to release records of the public body for inspection,
17
copying, or mechanical reproduction. At least one person shall be
18
available at all times to release records during the regular
19
business hours of the public body.
