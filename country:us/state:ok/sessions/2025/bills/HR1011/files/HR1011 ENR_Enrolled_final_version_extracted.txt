Child Abuse can be prevented and everyone has a role to play; and
WHEREAS, every child deserves to be safe, nurtured, and

safe, nurtured, and supported in their community; and
WHEREAS, the estimated cost to treat the effects of child

annually; and
WHEREAS, everyone has a role to play in preventing child abuse,
and all citizens must become aware of the importance of supporting

and
WHEREAS, too many of our community's children are exposed to
extreme and sustained stress-like child abuse and neglect, which can
be devastating to a child's development; and

development when the entire community takes responsibility for
creating healthy environments in which to raise its children; and
WHEREAS, the children in our community who have fallen victim to
maltreatment deserve high-quality, evidence-based services delivered
