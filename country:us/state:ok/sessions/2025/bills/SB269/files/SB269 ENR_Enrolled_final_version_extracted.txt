Section 90:
SECTION 3. AMENDATORY 27A O.S. 2021, Section 3-5-101, is
amended to read as follows:

Section 91:
Section 3-5-101. A. This act shall be known and may be cited
as the “Oklahoma Carbon Capture and Geologic Sequestration Act”.
B. The Legislature finds and declares that:

Section 92:
1. Carbon dioxide is a valuable commodity to the citizens of
the state, particularly for its value in enhancing the recovery of
oil and gas and for its use in other industrial and commercial
processes and applications;

Section 93:
2. Carbon dioxide is a gas produced when carbon is oxidized by
any process, including the combustion of material that contains
carbon such as coal, natural gas, oil and wood, all of which exist
in abundance in our state, and the production and use of which form
one of the foundations of our state’s economy;

Section 94:
3. Carbon dioxide is currently being released into the
atmosphere in substantial volumes;

Section 95:
4. In 1982, Oklahoma became the first state in the Union to
inject anthropogenic carbon dioxide underground. Since that time,
the continued injection of carbon dioxide has benefited the citizens
of the state by assisting enhanced oil recovery efforts. When
carbon dioxide is injected for enhanced oil recovery and not
otherwise vented, emitted or removed, such carbon dioxide is
sequestered and/or stored underground;

Section 96:
5. In its first 100 years, Oklahoma produced approximately 15
billion barrels of oil. The Department of Energy for the United
States has determined that Oklahoma has the potential to produce at
least 9 billion barrels of oil and possibly as much as 20 billion
barrels of oil through the use of carbon dioxide in enhanced oil
recovery. To fully produce those natural resources, additional
regulation is not necessary or appropriate but state incentives may
be helpful;

Section 97:
6. Storage of carbon dioxide in geological formations is an
effective and feasible strategy to deposit, store or sequester large
volumes of carbon dioxide over long periods of time;
ENR. S. B. NO. 269 Page 22

Section 98:
7. Geologic storage and sequestration of carbon dioxide allows
for the capture of carbon dioxide emissions and the orderly
withdrawal of the carbon dioxide as appropriate or necessary,
thereby allowing carbon dioxide to be available for commercial,
industrial, or other uses, including enhanced oil or gas recovery;

Section 99:
8. The transportation of carbon dioxide to, and the storage or
sequestration of carbon dioxide in, underground geological
formations for beneficial use or reuse in industrial and commercial
applications is expected to increase in the United States and in
Oklahoma due to initiatives by federal, state and local governments,
industry and commerce, and other interested persons, and may present
an opportunity for economic growth and development for the state;
and

Section 100:
9. It remains in the public interest for carbon dioxide to be
injected underground in this state. The geologic sequestration and
storage of anthropogenic carbon dioxide for purposes other than
injection for enhanced oil or gas recovery will benefit the citizens
of the state.
C. It is the intent of the Legislature that:

Section 101:
1. Efforts to capture, purify, compress, transport, inject, and
store or sequester carbon dioxide will enhance the production of oil
and natural gas in the state, further the development and production
of natural resources in the state, and provide opportunities for
economic growth and development for the state; and

Section 102:
2. In the event the State of Oklahoma establishes a unitization
process to support the establishment of CO sequestration facilities
2
in this state In accordance with the Oklahoma Carbon Capture and
Geologic Sequestration Act, the Corporation Commission shall
regulate all aspects of such process, including being responsible
for making any necessary findings concerning the suitability of the
reservoir targeted for carbon sequestration, whether its use for
such purpose is in the public interest, and the impact of that use
on the oil, gas, coal-bed methane and mineral brine resources in the
State of Oklahoma this state.

2
under the owner of the surface or mineral estate.
C. The facility operator, with permission of the facility
owner, may produce, take, extract or reduce to possession any carbon
dioxide injected, stored or sequestered in a CO sequestration
2
facility. In the event an operator informs the Commission that it
intends to conduct enhanced oil or gas recovery operations on a

act the Oklahoma Carbon Capture and Geologic Sequestration Act shall
be without prejudice to the rights of any surface owner or mineral
owner, including a working interest and royalty owner, well
operator, and gas storage operator of the land encompassed within
the defined geographic boundary of the CO sequestration facility, as
2
established or a CO storage unit permitted or authorized by the
2
Agency Corporation Commission, to drill or bore through the approved
reservoir in a manner as shall comply with orders, rules and
regulations issued for the purpose of protecting the approved
reservoir against the escape of CO . For purposes of this
2
subsection, the Agency with jurisdiction under other state law for
regulating the well being drilled or bored through the approved
reservoir is the Agency having jurisdiction to adopt orders and
rules for such well in order to protect the CO sequestration
2
facility, regardless of which Agency has jurisdiction to permit the
CO sequestration facility pursuant to Section 3 of this act. If the
2
Agency with jurisdiction under other state law for regulating the
ENR. S. B. NO. 269 Page 32
well being drilled or bored through the approved reservoir is not
the Agency that has jurisdiction to permit the CO sequestration
2
facility pursuant to Section 3 of this act, then the former shall
promptly notify the latter in writing of the receipt of an
application for the drilling or boring of such a well and shall
consider all timely submitted comments of the latter in approving,
denying, or setting conditions for the well being drilled or bored.
The additional cost of complying with such orders, rules or
regulations in order to protect the CO sequestration facility shall
2
be borne by the facility operator. The surface estate is servient
to the dominant mineral estate for the purposes of oil and gas
development.
D. Nothing in this act the Oklahoma Carbon Capture and Geologic
Sequestration Act shall grant a private operator the right of
condemnation or eminent domain for any purpose.

SECTION 3. AMENDATORY 27A O.S. 2021, Section 3-5-101, is
amended to read as follows:
Section 3-5-101. A. This act shall be known and may be cited
as the “Oklahoma Carbon Capture and Geologic Sequestration Act”.
B. The Legislature finds and declares that:
1. Carbon dioxide is a valuable commodity to the citizens of
the state, particularly for its value in enhancing the recovery of
oil and gas and for its use in other industrial and commercial
processes and applications;
2. Carbon dioxide is a gas produced when carbon is oxidized by
any process, including the combustion of material that contains
carbon such as coal, natural gas, oil and wood, all of which exist
in abundance in our state, and the production and use of which form
one of the foundations of our state’s economy;
3. Carbon dioxide is currently being released into the
atmosphere in substantial volumes;
4. In 1982, Oklahoma became the first state in the Union to
inject anthropogenic carbon dioxide underground. Since that time,
the continued injection of carbon dioxide has benefited the citizens
of the state by assisting enhanced oil recovery efforts. When
carbon dioxide is injected for enhanced oil recovery and not
otherwise vented, emitted or removed, such carbon dioxide is
sequestered and/or stored underground;
5. In its first 100 years, Oklahoma produced approximately 15
billion barrels of oil. The Department of Energy for the United
States has determined that Oklahoma has the potential to produce at
least 9 billion barrels of oil and possibly as much as 20 billion
barrels of oil through the use of carbon dioxide in enhanced oil
recovery. To fully produce those natural resources, additional
regulation is not necessary or appropriate but state incentives may
be helpful;
6. Storage of carbon dioxide in geological formations is an
effective and feasible strategy to deposit, store or sequester large
volumes of carbon dioxide over long periods of time;
ENR. S. B. NO. 269 Page 22

7. Geologic storage and sequestration of carbon dioxide allows
for the capture of carbon dioxide emissions and the orderly
withdrawal of the carbon dioxide as appropriate or necessary,
thereby allowing carbon dioxide to be available for commercial,
industrial, or other uses, including enhanced oil or gas recovery;
8. The transportation of carbon dioxide to, and the storage or
sequestration of carbon dioxide in, underground geological
formations for beneficial use or reuse in industrial and commercial
applications is expected to increase in the United States and in
Oklahoma due to initiatives by federal, state and local governments,
industry and commerce, and other interested persons, and may present
an opportunity for economic growth and development for the state;
and
9. It remains in the public interest for carbon dioxide to be
injected underground in this state. The geologic sequestration and
storage of anthropogenic carbon dioxide for purposes other than
injection for enhanced oil or gas recovery will benefit the citizens
of the state.
C. It is the intent of the Legislature that:
1. Efforts to capture, purify, compress, transport, inject, and
store or sequester carbon dioxide will enhance the production of oil
and natural gas in the state, further the development and production
of natural resources in the state, and provide opportunities for
economic growth and development for the state; and
2. In the event the State of Oklahoma establishes a unitization
process to support the establishment of CO sequestration facilities
2
in this state In accordance with the Oklahoma Carbon Capture and
Geologic Sequestration Act, the Corporation Commission shall
regulate all aspects of such process, including being responsible
for making any necessary findings concerning the suitability of the
reservoir targeted for carbon sequestration, whether its use for
such purpose is in the public interest, and the impact of that use
on the oil, gas, coal-bed methane and mineral brine resources in the
State of Oklahoma this state.

2 2
with a CO sequestration facility is considered to be the personal
2
property of the facility owner.
B. Absent a final judgment of willful abandonment rendered by a
court of competent jurisdiction, or a regulatory determination of
willful abandonment, carbon dioxide injected into a CO sequestration
2
facility or a storage unit associated with a CO sequestration
2
facility is not considered to be the property of the owner of the
surface or mineral estate in the land encompassing the geographic
boundary of the CO sequestration facility, or any person claiming
2
under the owner of the surface or mineral estate.
C. The facility operator, with permission of the facility
owner, may produce, take, extract or reduce to possession any carbon
dioxide injected, stored or sequestered in a CO sequestration
2
facility. In the event an operator informs the Commission that it
intends to conduct enhanced oil or gas recovery operations on a
compulsory unit formed pursuant to Section 287.1 et seq. of Title 52
of the Oklahoma statutes, or its predecessor unitization act, then
during the time that such unit is in operation, such operator shall
be relieved of any obligation to either:
1. Plug and abandon any injection or production well within
such unit that is intended to be used in such enhanced oil or gas
recovery operations, unless required by the Commission pursuant to

facility.
SECTION 8. AMENDATORY 27A O.S. 2021, Section 3-5-106, is
amended to read as follows:
Section 3-5-106. A. Nothing in this act the Oklahoma Carbon
Capture and Geologic Sequestration Act shall supersede the
provisions of the Oklahoma Carbon Sequestration Enhancement Act,
Section 3-4-101 et seq. of Title 27A of the Oklahoma Statutes this
title.
B. Nothing in this act the Oklahoma Carbon Capture and Geologic
Sequestration Act shall alter the incidents of ownership, or other
rights, of the owners of the mineral estate or adversely affect
enhanced oil or gas recovery efforts in the state.
C. Any right granted to a facility operator pursuant to this
act the Oklahoma Carbon Capture and Geologic Sequestration Act shall
be without prejudice to the rights of any surface owner or mineral
owner, including a working interest and royalty owner, well
operator, and gas storage operator of the land encompassed within
the defined geographic boundary of the CO sequestration facility, as
2
established or a CO storage unit permitted or authorized by the
2
Agency Corporation Commission, to drill or bore through the approved
reservoir in a manner as shall comply with orders, rules and
regulations issued for the purpose of protecting the approved
reservoir against the escape of CO . For purposes of this
2
subsection, the Agency with jurisdiction under other state law for
regulating the well being drilled or bored through the approved
reservoir is the Agency having jurisdiction to adopt orders and
rules for such well in order to protect the CO sequestration
2
facility, regardless of which Agency has jurisdiction to permit the
CO sequestration facility pursuant to Section 3 of this act. If the
2
Agency with jurisdiction under other state law for regulating the
ENR. S. B. NO. 269 Page 32

well being drilled or bored through the approved reservoir is not
the Agency that has jurisdiction to permit the CO sequestration
2
facility pursuant to Section 3 of this act, then the former shall
promptly notify the latter in writing of the receipt of an
application for the drilling or boring of such a well and shall
consider all timely submitted comments of the latter in approving,
denying, or setting conditions for the well being drilled or bored.
The additional cost of complying with such orders, rules or
regulations in order to protect the CO sequestration facility shall
2
be borne by the facility operator. The surface estate is servient
to the dominant mineral estate for the purposes of oil and gas
development.
D. Nothing in this act the Oklahoma Carbon Capture and Geologic
Sequestration Act shall grant a private operator the right of
condemnation or eminent domain for any purpose.
SECTION 9. NEW LAW A new section of law to be codified
in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 3-5-107 of Title 27A, unless
there is created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:

presented by the parties as to such fair market value, including,
but not limited to, arm’s length consummated transactions involving
the transfer of the right to use pore space for the injection and
storage of CO , taking into account any differences in the
2
circumstances involved in any such consummated transaction, and the
specific circumstances involved in the proposed CO storage unit.
2
The Commission shall make provisions for payment of the amounts
set forth above to the owners of the right to inject and store CO in
2
the pore space of the approved reservoir who elect or are deemed to
