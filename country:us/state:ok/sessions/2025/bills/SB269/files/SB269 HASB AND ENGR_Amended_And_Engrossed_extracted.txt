4 SECTION 3. AMENDATORY 27A O.S. 2021, Section 3-5-101, is
5 amended to read as follows:
6 Section 3-5-101. A. This act shall be known and may be cited
7 as the “Oklahoma Carbon Capture and Geologic Sequestration Act”.
8 B. The Legislature finds and declares that:
9 1. Carbon dioxide is a valuable commodity to the citizens of
10 the state, particularly for its value in enhancing the recovery of
11 oil and gas and for its use in other industrial and commercial
12 processes and applications;
13 2. Carbon dioxide is a gas produced when carbon is oxidized by
14 any process, including the combustion of material that contains
15 carbon such as coal, natural gas, oil and wood, all of which exist
16 in abundance in our state, and the production and use of which form
17 one of the foundations of our state’s economy;
18 3. Carbon dioxide is currently being released into the
19 atmosphere in substantial volumes;
20 4. In 1982, Oklahoma became the first state in the Union to
21 inject anthropogenic carbon dioxide underground. Since that time,
22 the continued injection of carbon dioxide has benefited the citizens
23 of the state by assisting enhanced oil recovery efforts. When
24 carbon dioxide is injected for enhanced oil recovery and not
ENGR. H. A. to ENGR. S. B. NO. 269 Page 30
1 othe rwise vented, emitted or removed, such carbon dioxide is
2 sequestered and/or stored underground;
3 5. In its first 100 years, Oklahoma produced approximately 15
4 billion barrels of oil. The Department of Energy for the United
5 States has determined that Oklahoma has the potential to produce at
6 least 9 billion barrels of oil and possibly as much as 20 billion
7 barrels of oil through the use of carbon dioxide in enhanced oil
8 recovery. To fully produce those natural resources, additional
9 regulation is not necessary or appropriate but state incentives may
10 be helpful;
11 6. Storage of carbon dioxide in geological formations is an
12 effective and feasible strategy to deposit, store or sequester large
13 volumes of carbon dioxide over long periods of time;
14 7. Geologic storage and sequestration of carbon dioxide allows
15 for the capture of carbon dioxide emissions and the orderly
16 withdrawal of the carbon dioxide as appropriate or necessary,
17 thereby allowing carbon dioxide to be available for commercial,
18 industrial, or other uses, including enhanced oil or gas recovery;
19 8. The transportation of carbon dioxide to, and the storage or
20 sequestration of carbon dioxide in, underground geological
21 formations for beneficial use or reuse in industrial and commercial
22 applications is expected to increase in the United States and in
23 Oklahoma due to initiatives by federal, state and local governments,
24 industry and commerce, and other interested persons, and may present
ENGR. H. A. to ENGR. S. B. NO. 269 Page 31
1 an o pportunity for economic growth and development for the state;
2 and
3 9. It remains in the public interest for carbon dioxide to be
4 injected underground in this state. The geologic sequestration and
5 storage of anthropogenic carbon dioxide for purposes other than
6 injection for enhanced oil or gas recovery will benefit the citizens
7 of the state.
8 C. It is the intent of the Legislature that:
9 1. Efforts to capture, purify, compress, transport, inject, and
10 store or sequester carbon dioxide will enhance the production of oil
11 and natural gas in the state, further the development and production
12 of natural resources in the state, and provide opportunities for
13 economic growth and development for the state; and
14 2. In the event the State of Oklahoma establishes a unitization
15 process to support the establishment of CO sequestration facilities
2
16 in this state In accordance with the Oklahoma Carbon Capture and
17 Geologic Sequestration Act, the Corporation Commission shall
18 regulate all aspects of such process, including being responsible
19 for making any necessary findings concerning the suitability of the
20 reservoir targeted for carbon sequestration, whether its use for
21 such purpose is in the public interest, and the impact of that use
22 on the oil, gas, coal-bed methane and mineral brine resources in the
23 State of Oklahoma this state.

10 SECTION 16. AMENDATORY 27A O.S. 2021, Section 3-5-101,
11 is amended to read as follows:
12 Section 3-5-101. A. This act shall be known and may be cited
13 as the “Oklahoma Carbon Capture and Geologic Sequestration Act”.
14 B. The Legislature finds and declares that:
15 1. Carbon dioxide is a valuable commodity to the citizens of
16 the state, particularly for its value in enhancing the recovery of
17 oil and gas and for its use in other industrial and commercial
18 processes and applications;
19 2. Carbon dioxide is a gas produced when carbon is oxidized by
20 any process, including the combustion of material that contains
21 carbon such as coal, natural gas, oil and wood, all of which exist
22 in abundance in our state, and the production and use of which form
23 one of the foundations of our state’s economy;
24
ENGR. S. B. NO. 269 Page 28
1 3. Carbon dioxide is currently being released into the
2 atmosphere in substantial volumes;
3 4. In 1982, Oklahoma became the first state in the Union to
4 inject anthropogenic carbon dioxide underground. Since that time,
5 the continued injection of carbon dioxide has benefited the citizens
6 of the state by assisting enhanced oil recovery efforts. When
7 carbon dioxide is injected for enhanced oil recovery and not
8 otherwise vented, emitted or removed, such carbon dioxide is
9 sequestered and/or stored underground;
10 5. In its first 100 years, Oklahoma produced approximately 15
11 billion barrels of oil. The Department of Energy for the United
12 States has determined that Oklahoma has the potential to produce at
13 least 9 billion barrels of oil and possibly as much as 20 billion
14 barrels of oil through the use of carbon dioxide in enhanced oil
15 recovery. To fully produce those natural resources, additional
16 regulation is not necessary or appropriate but state incentives may
17 be helpful;
18 6. Storage of carbon dioxide in geological formations is an
19 effective and feasible strategy to deposit, store or sequester large
20 volumes of carbon dioxide over long periods of time;
21 7. Geologic storage and sequestration of carbon dioxide allows
22 for the capture of carbon dioxide emissions and the orderly
23 withdrawal of the carbon dioxide as appropriate or necessary,
24
ENGR. S. B. NO. 269 Page 29
1 ther eby allowing carbon dioxide to be available for commercial,
2 industrial, or other uses, including enhanced oil or gas recovery;
3 8. The transportation of carbon dioxide to, and the storage or
4 sequestration of carbon dioxide in, underground geological
5 formations for beneficial use or reuse in industrial and commercial
6 applications is expected to increase in the United States and in
7 Oklahoma due to initiatives by federal, state and local governments,
8 industry and commerce, and other interested persons, and may present
9 an opportunity for economic growth and development for the state;
10 and
11 9. It remains in the public interest for carbon dioxide to be
12 injected underground in this state. The geologic sequestration and
13 storage of anthropogenic carbon dioxide for purposes other than
14 injection for enhanced oil or gas recovery will benefit the citizens
15 of the state.
16 C. It is the intent of the Legislature that:
17 1. Efforts to capture, purify, compress, transport, inject, and
18 store or sequester carbon dioxide will enhance the production of oil
19 and natural gas in the state, further the development and production
20 of natural resources in the state, and provide opportunities for
21 economic growth and development for the state; and
22 2. In the event the State of Oklahoma establishes a unitization
23 process to support the establishment of CO sequestration facilities
2
24 in this state In accordance with the Oklahoma Carbon Capture and
ENGR. S. B. NO. 269 Page 30
1 Geol ogic Sequestration Act, the Corporation Commission shall
2 regulate all aspects of such process, including being responsible
3 for making any necessary findings concerning the suitability of the
4 reservoir targeted for carbon sequestration, whether its use for
5 such purpose is in the public interest, and the impact of that use
6 on the oil, gas, coal-bed methane and mineral brine resources in the
7 State of Oklahoma this state.

4 SECTION 3. AMENDATORY 27A O.S. 2021, Section 3-5-101, is
5 amended to read as follows:
6 Section 3-5-101. A. This act shall be known and may be cited
7 as the “Oklahoma Carbon Capture and Geologic Sequestration Act”.
8 B. The Legislature finds and declares that:
9 1. Carbon dioxide is a valuable commodity to the citizens of
10 the state, particularly for its value in enhancing the recovery of
11 oil and gas and for its use in other industrial and commercial
12 processes and applications;
13 2. Carbon dioxide is a gas produced when carbon is oxidized by
14 any process, including the combustion of material that contains
15 carbon such as coal, natural gas, oil and wood, all of which exist
16 in abundance in our state, and the production and use of which form
17 one of the foundations of our state’s economy;
18 3. Carbon dioxide is currently being released into the
19 atmosphere in substantial volumes;
20 4. In 1982, Oklahoma became the first state in the Union to
21 inject anthropogenic carbon dioxide underground. Since that time,
22 the continued injection of carbon dioxide has benefited the citizens
23 of the state by assisting enhanced oil recovery efforts. When
24 carbon dioxide is injected for enhanced oil recovery and not
ENGR. H. A. to ENGR. S. B. NO. 269 Page 30

1 othe rwise vented, emitted or removed, such carbon dioxide is
2 sequestered and/or stored underground;
3 5. In its first 100 years, Oklahoma produced approximately 15
4 billion barrels of oil. The Department of Energy for the United
5 States has determined that Oklahoma has the potential to produce at
6 least 9 billion barrels of oil and possibly as much as 20 billion
7 barrels of oil through the use of carbon dioxide in enhanced oil
8 recovery. To fully produce those natural resources, additional
9 regulation is not necessary or appropriate but state incentives may
10 be helpful;
11 6. Storage of carbon dioxide in geological formations is an
12 effective and feasible strategy to deposit, store or sequester large
13 volumes of carbon dioxide over long periods of time;
14 7. Geologic storage and sequestration of carbon dioxide allows
15 for the capture of carbon dioxide emissions and the orderly
16 withdrawal of the carbon dioxide as appropriate or necessary,
17 thereby allowing carbon dioxide to be available for commercial,
18 industrial, or other uses, including enhanced oil or gas recovery;
19 8. The transportation of carbon dioxide to, and the storage or
20 sequestration of carbon dioxide in, underground geological
21 formations for beneficial use or reuse in industrial and commercial
22 applications is expected to increase in the United States and in
23 Oklahoma due to initiatives by federal, state and local governments,
24 industry and commerce, and other interested persons, and may present
ENGR. H. A. to ENGR. S. B. NO. 269 Page 31

1 an o pportunity for economic growth and development for the state;
2 and
3 9. It remains in the public interest for carbon dioxide to be
4 injected underground in this state. The geologic sequestration and
5 storage of anthropogenic carbon dioxide for purposes other than
6 injection for enhanced oil or gas recovery will benefit the citizens
7 of the state.
8 C. It is the intent of the Legislature that:
9 1. Efforts to capture, purify, compress, transport, inject, and
10 store or sequester carbon dioxide will enhance the production of oil
11 and natural gas in the state, further the development and production
12 of natural resources in the state, and provide opportunities for
13 economic growth and development for the state; and
14 2. In the event the State of Oklahoma establishes a unitization
15 process to support the establishment of CO sequestration facilities
2
16 in this state In accordance with the Oklahoma Carbon Capture and
17 Geologic Sequestration Act, the Corporation Commission shall
18 regulate all aspects of such process, including being responsible
19 for making any necessary findings concerning the suitability of the
20 reservoir targeted for carbon sequestration, whether its use for
21 such purpose is in the public interest, and the impact of that use
22 on the oil, gas, coal-bed methane and mineral brine resources in the
23 State of Oklahoma this state.

10 SECTION 16. AMENDATORY 27A O.S. 2021, Section 3-5-101,
11 is amended to read as follows:
12 Section 3-5-101. A. This act shall be known and may be cited
13 as the “Oklahoma Carbon Capture and Geologic Sequestration Act”.
14 B. The Legislature finds and declares that:
15 1. Carbon dioxide is a valuable commodity to the citizens of
16 the state, particularly for its value in enhancing the recovery of
17 oil and gas and for its use in other industrial and commercial
18 processes and applications;
19 2. Carbon dioxide is a gas produced when carbon is oxidized by
20 any process, including the combustion of material that contains
21 carbon such as coal, natural gas, oil and wood, all of which exist
22 in abundance in our state, and the production and use of which form
23 one of the foundations of our state’s economy;
24
ENGR. S. B. NO. 269 Page 28

1 3. Carbon dioxide is currently being released into the
2 atmosphere in substantial volumes;
3 4. In 1982, Oklahoma became the first state in the Union to
4 inject anthropogenic carbon dioxide underground. Since that time,
5 the continued injection of carbon dioxide has benefited the citizens
6 of the state by assisting enhanced oil recovery efforts. When
7 carbon dioxide is injected for enhanced oil recovery and not
8 otherwise vented, emitted or removed, such carbon dioxide is
9 sequestered and/or stored underground;
10 5. In its first 100 years, Oklahoma produced approximately 15
11 billion barrels of oil. The Department of Energy for the United
12 States has determined that Oklahoma has the potential to produce at
13 least 9 billion barrels of oil and possibly as much as 20 billion
14 barrels of oil through the use of carbon dioxide in enhanced oil
15 recovery. To fully produce those natural resources, additional
16 regulation is not necessary or appropriate but state incentives may
17 be helpful;
18 6. Storage of carbon dioxide in geological formations is an
19 effective and feasible strategy to deposit, store or sequester large
20 volumes of carbon dioxide over long periods of time;
21 7. Geologic storage and sequestration of carbon dioxide allows
22 for the capture of carbon dioxide emissions and the orderly
23 withdrawal of the carbon dioxide as appropriate or necessary,
24
ENGR. S. B. NO. 269 Page 29

1 ther eby allowing carbon dioxide to be available for commercial,
2 industrial, or other uses, including enhanced oil or gas recovery;
3 8. The transportation of carbon dioxide to, and the storage or
4 sequestration of carbon dioxide in, underground geological
5 formations for beneficial use or reuse in industrial and commercial
6 applications is expected to increase in the United States and in
7 Oklahoma due to initiatives by federal, state and local governments,
8 industry and commerce, and other interested persons, and may present
9 an opportunity for economic growth and development for the state;
10 and
11 9. It remains in the public interest for carbon dioxide to be
12 injected underground in this state. The geologic sequestration and
13 storage of anthropogenic carbon dioxide for purposes other than
14 injection for enhanced oil or gas recovery will benefit the citizens
15 of the state.
16 C. It is the intent of the Legislature that:
17 1. Efforts to capture, purify, compress, transport, inject, and
18 store or sequester carbon dioxide will enhance the production of oil
19 and natural gas in the state, further the development and production
20 of natural resources in the state, and provide opportunities for
21 economic growth and development for the state; and
22 2. In the event the State of Oklahoma establishes a unitization
23 process to support the establishment of CO sequestration facilities
2
24 in this state In accordance with the Oklahoma Carbon Capture and
ENGR. S. B. NO. 269 Page 30

1 Geol ogic Sequestration Act, the Corporation Commission shall
2 regulate all aspects of such process, including being responsible
3 for making any necessary findings concerning the suitability of the
4 reservoir targeted for carbon sequestration, whether its use for
5 such purpose is in the public interest, and the impact of that use
6 on the oil, gas, coal-bed methane and mineral brine resources in the
7 State of Oklahoma this state.

20 A. There is hereby created in the State Treasury a revolving
21 fund for the Corporation Commission to be designated the “Class VI
22 Carbon Sequestration Storage Facility Revolving Fund”. The fund
23 shall be a continuing fund, not subject to fiscal year limitations,
24 and shall consist of all monies received by the Commission from
ENGR. S. B. NO. 269 Page 57

1 fine s and fees paid to the Corporation Commission pursuant to
2 Sections 9 and 10 of this act. All monies accruing to the credit of
3 the fund are hereby appropriated and may be budgeted and expended by
4 the Commission for the purpose provided for in this section.
5 Expenditures from the fund shall be made upon warrants issued by the
6 State Treasurer against claims filed as prescribed by law with the
7 Director of the Office of Management and Enterprise Services for
8 approval and payment.
9 B. If a CO sequestration facility or a CO storage unit as a
2 2
10 part of a CO sequestration facility at any time deposits more than
2
11 Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000.00) to the fund, the fee
12 assessments to that facility or unit shall cease until such time as
13 funds begin to be expended for that facility or unit. The State
14 Treasurer shall certify to the Corporation Commission the date on
15 which the balance in the fund for a facility or unit equals or
16 exceeds Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000.00). On and after the
17 first day of the second month following the certification, fees
18 shall not be collected from such facility or unit; provided, fee
19 collection shall resume on receipt of a certification by the State
20 Treasurer that, based on the expenditures and commitments to expend
21 monies, the fund has fallen below Four Million Dollars
22 ($4,000,000.00) of funds collected from that facility.
23 C. Expenditures from the fund may be used to:
24
