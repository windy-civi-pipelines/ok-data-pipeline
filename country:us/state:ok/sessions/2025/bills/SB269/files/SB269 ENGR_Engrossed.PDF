10 SECTION 3. AMENDATORY 27A O.S. 2021, Section 3-5-101, is
11 amended to read as follows:
12 Section 3-5-101. A. This act shall be known and may be cited
13 as the “Oklahoma Carbon Capture and Geologic Sequestration Act”.
14 B. The Legislature finds and declares that:
15 1. Carbon dioxide is a valuable commodity to the citizens of
16 the state, particularly for its value in enhancing the recovery of
17 oil and gas and for its use in other industrial and commercial
18 processes and applications;
19 2. Carbon dioxide is a gas produced when carbon is oxidized by
20 any process, including the combustion of material that contains
21 carbon such as coal, natural gas, oil and wood, all of which exist
22 in abundance in our state, and the production and use of which form
23 one of the foundations of our state’s economy;
24
ENGR. S. B. NO. 269 Page 28

1 3. Carbon dioxide is currently being released into the
2 atmosphere in substantial volumes;
3 4. In 1982, Oklahoma became the first state in the Union to
4 inject anthropogenic carbon dioxide underground. Since that time,
5 the continued injection of carbon dioxide has benefited the citizens
6 of the state by assisting enhanced oil recovery efforts. When
7 carbon dioxide is injected for enhanced oil recovery and not
8 otherwise vented, emitted or removed, such carbon dioxide is
9 sequestered and/or stored underground;
10 5. In its first 100 years, Oklahoma produced approximately 15
11 billion barrels of oil. The Department of Energy for the United
12 States has determined that Oklahoma has the potential to produce at
13 least 9 billion barrels of oil and possibly as much as 20 billion
14 barrels of oil through the use of carbon dioxide in enhanced oil
15 recovery. To fully produce those natural resources, additional
16 regulation is not necessary or appropriate but state incentives may
17 be helpful;
18 6. Storage of carbon dioxide in geological formations is an
19 effective and feasible strategy to deposit, store or sequester large
20 volumes of carbon dioxide over long periods of time;
21 7. Geologic storage and sequestration of carbon dioxide allows
22 for the capture of carbon dioxide emissions and the orderly
23 withdrawal of the carbon dioxide as appropriate or necessary,
24
ENGR. S. B. NO. 269 Page 29

1 ther eby allowing carbon dioxide to be available for commercial,
2 industrial, or other uses, including enhanced oil or gas recovery;
3 8. The transportation of carbon dioxide to, and the storage or
4 sequestration of carbon dioxide in, underground geological
5 formations for beneficial use or reuse in industrial and commercial
6 applications is expected to increase in the United States and in
7 Oklahoma due to initiatives by federal, state and local governments,
8 industry and commerce, and other interested persons, and may present
9 an opportunity for economic growth and development for the state;
10 and
11 9. It remains in the public interest for carbon dioxide to be
12 injected underground in this state. The geologic sequestration and
13 storage of anthropogenic carbon dioxide for purposes other than
14 injection for enhanced oil or gas recovery will benefit the citizens
15 of the state.
16 C. It is the intent of the Legislature that:
17 1. Efforts to capture, purify, compress, transport, inject, and
18 store or sequester carbon dioxide will enhance the production of oil
19 and natural gas in the state, further the development and production
20 of natural resources in the state, and provide opportunities for
21 economic growth and development for the state; and
22 2. In the event the State of Oklahoma establishes a unitization
23 process to support the establishment of CO sequestration facilities
2
24 in this state In accordance with the Oklahoma Carbon Capture and
ENGR. S. B. NO. 269 Page 30

1 Geol ogic Sequestration Act, the Corporation Commission shall
2 regulate all aspects of such process, including being responsible
3 for making any necessary findings concerning the suitability of the
4 reservoir targeted for carbon sequestration, whether its use for
5 such purpose is in the public interest, and the impact of that use
6 on the oil, gas, coal-bed methane and mineral brine resources in the
7 State of Oklahoma this state.
