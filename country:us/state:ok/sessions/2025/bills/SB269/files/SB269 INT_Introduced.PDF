SECTION 3. AMENDATORY 27A O.S. 2021, Section 3-5-101, is
10
11
amended to read as follows:
11
12
Section 3-5-101. A. This act shall be known and may be cited
12
13
as the “Oklahoma Carbon Capture and Geologic Sequestration Act”.
13
14
B. The Legislature finds and declares that:
14
15
1. Carbon dioxide is a valuable commodity to the citizens of
15
16
the state, particularly for its value in enhancing the recovery of
16
17
oil and gas and for its use in other industrial and commercial
17
18
processes and applications;
18
19
2. Carbon dioxide is a gas produced when carbon is oxidized by
19
20
any process, including the combustion of material that contains
20
21
carbon such as coal, natural gas, oil and wood, all of which exist
21
22
in abundance in our state, and the production and use of which form
22
23
one of the foundations of our state’s economy;
23
24
24
Req. No. 71 Page 29

1
3. Carbon dioxide is currently being released into the
1
2
atmosphere in substantial volumes;
2
3
4. In 1982, Oklahoma became the first state in the Union to
3
4
inject anthropogenic carbon dioxide underground. Since that time,
4
5
the continued injection of carbon dioxide has benefited the citizens
5
6
of the state by assisting enhanced oil recovery efforts. When
6
7
carbon dioxide is injected for enhanced oil recovery and not
7
8
otherwise vented, emitted or removed, such carbon dioxide is
8
9
sequestered and/or stored underground;
9
10
5. In its first 100 years, Oklahoma produced approximately 15
10
11
billion barrels of oil. The Department of Energy for the United
11
12
States has determined that Oklahoma has the potential to produce at
12
13
least 9 billion barrels of oil and possibly as much as 20 billion
13
14
barrels of oil through the use of carbon dioxide in enhanced oil
14
15
recovery. To fully produce those natural resources, additional
15
16
regulation is not necessary or appropriate but state incentives may
16
17
be helpful;
17
18
6. Storage of carbon dioxide in geological formations is an
18
19
effective and feasible strategy to deposit, store or sequester large
19
20
volumes of carbon dioxide over long periods of time;
20
21
7. Geologic storage and sequestration of carbon dioxide allows
21
22
for the capture of carbon dioxide emissions and the orderly
22
23
withdrawal of the carbon dioxide as appropriate or necessary,
23
24
24
Req. No. 71 Page 30

1
thereby allowing carbon dioxide to be available for commercial,
1
2
industrial, or other uses, including enhanced oil or gas recovery;
2
3
8. The transportation of carbon dioxide to, and the storage or
3
4
sequestration of carbon dioxide in, underground geological
4
5
formations for beneficial use or reuse in industrial and commercial
5
6
applications is expected to increase in the United States and in
6
7
Oklahoma due to initiatives by federal, state and local governments,
7
8
industry and commerce, and other interested persons, and may present
8
9
an opportunity for economic growth and development for the state;
9
10
and
10
11
9. It remains in the public interest for carbon dioxide to be
11
12
injected underground in this state. The geologic sequestration and
12
13
storage of anthropogenic carbon dioxide for purposes other than
13
14
injection for enhanced oil or gas recovery will benefit the citizens
14
15
of the state.
15
16
C. It is the intent of the Legislature that:
16
17
1. Efforts to capture, purify, compress, transport, inject, and
17
18
store or sequester carbon dioxide will enhance the production of oil
18
19
and natural gas in the state, further the development and production
19
20
of natural resources in the state, and provide opportunities for
20
21
economic growth and development for the state; and
21
22
2. In the event the State of Oklahoma establishes a unitization
22
23
process to support the establishment of CO sequestration facilities
2
23
24
in this state In accordance with the Oklahoma Carbon Capture and
24
Req. No. 71 Page 31

1
Geologic Sequestration Act, the Corporation Commission shall
1
2
regulate all aspects of such process, including being responsible
2
3
for making any necessary findings concerning the suitability of the
3
4
reservoir targeted for carbon sequestration, whether its use for
4
5
such purpose is in the public interest, and the impact of that use
5
6
on the oil, gas, coal-bed methane and mineral brine resources in the
6
7
State of Oklahoma.
