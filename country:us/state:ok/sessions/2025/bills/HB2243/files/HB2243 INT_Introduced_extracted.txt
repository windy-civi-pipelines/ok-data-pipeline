13 SECTION 1. NEW LAW A new section of law to be codified
14 in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 13001 of Title 74, unless there
15 is created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:
16 The Legislature finds that:
17 1. Antisemitism, including harassment on the basis of actual or
18 perceived Jewish origin, ancestry, ethnicity, identity, affiliation,
19 or faith, remains a persistent, pervasive, and disturbing problem in
20 contemporary American society;
21 2. Jewish people continue to be a targeted minority in the
22 United States. Data shows, for instance, that Jews are consistently
23 the most likely of all religious groups to be victimized by
24
Req. No. 11713 Page 1
1 inci dents of hate, and that such incidents are increasing at an
2 alarming rate;
3 3. State officials and institutions have a responsibility to
4 protect citizens from acts of hate and bigotry motivated by
5 discriminatory animus, including antisemitism, and must be given the
6 tools to do so;
7 4. Valid monitoring, informed analysis and investigation, and
8 effective policymaking all require uniform definitions;
9 5. While there can be no exhaustive definition of antisemitism,
10 as it can take many forms, the International Holocaust Remembrance
11 Alliance (IHRA) Working Definition has been an essential
12 definitional tool used to determine contemporary manifestations of
13 antisemitism and includes useful examples of discriminatory anti-
14 Israel acts that can cross the line into antisemitism;
15 6. The IHRA definition is used by various agencies of the
16 federal government and by over 30 governments around the world,
17 recommended for use by the European Council and the European
18 Parliament, endorsed by the Secretary-General of the United Nations,
19 included in policy guides prepared by the Organization for Security
20 and Cooperation in Europe, and has been formally adopted by a
21 growing number of nations, cities, universities, and civil society
22 organizations; and
23 7. Use of this definition of antisemitism, although it is not
24 to be taken as an exhaustive definition, will increase the awareness

1 and understanding of the parameters of contemporary anti-Jewish
2 discrimination in certain circumscribed areas.
3 SECTION 2. NEW LAW A new section of law to be codified
4 in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 13002 of Title 74, unless there
5 is created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:
6 A. As used in this section, the term "antisemitism" has the
7 same meaning as provided for in the working definition of
8 antisemitism adopted by the International Holocaust Remembrance
9 Alliance (IHRA) on May 26, 2016, and includes the examples of
10 antisemitism set forth therein.
11 B. All state departments and agencies shall consider
12 antisemitism as evidence of discriminatory intent for any law or
13 policy in this state which prohibits discrimination based on race,
14 color, religion, or national origin or provides for enhanced
15 criminal penalties for criminal offenses when the defendant
16 intentionally selected any victim or group of victims or any
17 property as the object of the offense because of such victim's or
18 group of victims' actual or perceived race, color, religion, or
19 national origin.
20 C. Nothing in this section shall be construed to diminish or
21 infringe upon any right protected under the First Amendment to the
22 United States Constitution or the Oklahoma Constitution.
23 D. Nothing in this section shall be construed to conflict with
24 local, federal, or state discrimination laws.
Req. No. 11713 Page 3
1 E. Nothing in this section shall be construed to alter the
2 evidentiary requirements pursuant to which an agency or department
3 makes a determination that conduct, including harassment, amounts to
4 actionable discrimination, or to diminish or infringe upon the
5 rights protected under any other provision of law.
6 F. Nothing in this section shall be construed to impair or
7 otherwise affect the authority granted by law to a department or
8 agency.
9 G. This section is not intended to and does not create any
10 right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or
11 in equity by any party against the state, its departments, agencies,
12 or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other
13 person.
