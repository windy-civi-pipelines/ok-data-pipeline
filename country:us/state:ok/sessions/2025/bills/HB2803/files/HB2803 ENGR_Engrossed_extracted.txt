16 pays the beer distributor the fair market value of the distribution
17 rights which will be lost or diminished by reason of the termination
18 and purchase any remaining non-expired inventory for laid in cost.
19 2. If such small brewer and beer distributor cannot mutually
20 agree to the fair market value of the applicable distribution rights
21 lost or diminished by reason of the termination, then the brewer
22 shall pay the beer distributor a good faith estimate of the fair
23 market value of the applicable distribution rights.
24
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2803 Page 12
1 3. If the beer distributor being terminated under paragraph 2
2 of this subsection disputes that the payment made by the small
3 brewer was less than the fair market value of the distribution
4 rights, then the beer distributor may within forty-five (45) days of
5 termination submit the question of fair market value of the
6 applicable distribution rights lost or diminished by reason of the
7 termination to binding arbitration before a panel of three neutral
8 arbitrators appointed in accordance with the commercial arbitration
9 rules of the American Arbitration Association, which panel shall
10 determine by majority decision whether the small brewer's payment
11 meets the requirements of paragraph 2 of this subsection.
12 4. If the arbitration panel rules that the payment made by the
13 small brewer to the beer distributor upon termination was less than
14 the fair market value of distribution rights lost or diminished by
15 reason of the termination, then the small brewer must pay the beer
16 distributor the difference between the payment made to the beer
17 distributor and the determined fair market value plus interest.
18 5. If the arbitration panel rules that the payment made by the
19 small brewer to the beer distributor upon termination was more than
20 the fair market value of distribution rights lost or diminished by
21 reason of the termination, then the beer distributor must pay the
22 small brewer the difference between the payment made to the beer
23 distributor and the determined fair market value, plus interest.
24
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2803 Page 13
1 6. All arbitration fees and expenses shall be equally divided
2 among the parties to the arbitration, except if the arbitration
3 panel determines that the small brewer's payment upon termination
4 was not a good-faith estimate of the fair market value, then the
5 panel may award up to one hundred percent (100%) of the arbitration
6 costs to the prevailing party.
7 H. 1. Any beer distributor or brewer who is aggrieved by a
8 violation of any provision of this section shall be entitled to the
9 recovery of damages caused by the violation. If a beer distributor
10 is not terminated in accordance with the provisions of this section,
11 damages may additionally include the fair market value of the
12 distribution rights and purchase any remaining non-expired inventory
13 for laid in cost. Damages shall be sought in a civil action in any
14 court of competent jurisdiction.
15 2. Any dispute arising under this section may also be settled
16 by such dispute resolution procedures as may be provided by a
17 written agreement between the parties.

19 prohibit good-faith settlements voluntarily entered into by the
20 parties.

18 distribution business in the subject territory.

18 distributor or successor beer distributor would have
19 had in the arbitration and is considered to have

17 rights which will be lost or diminished by reason of the termination
18 and purchase any remaining non-expired inventory for laid in cost.
19 2. If such small brewer and beer distributor cannot mutually
20 agree to the fair market value of the applicable distribution rights
21 lost or diminished by reason of the termination, then the brewer
22 shall pay the beer distributor a good faith estimate of the fair
23 market value of the applicable distribution rights.
24
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2803 Page 12

1 3. If the beer distributor being terminated under paragraph 2
2 of this subsection disputes that the payment made by the small
3 brewer was less than the fair market value of the distribution
4 rights, then the beer distributor may within forty-five (45) days of
5 termination submit the question of fair market value of the
6 applicable distribution rights lost or diminished by reason of the
7 termination to binding arbitration before a panel of three neutral
8 arbitrators appointed in accordance with the commercial arbitration
9 rules of the American Arbitration Association, which panel shall
10 determine by majority decision whether the small brewer's payment
11 meets the requirements of paragraph 2 of this subsection.
12 4. If the arbitration panel rules that the payment made by the
13 small brewer to the beer distributor upon termination was less than
14 the fair market value of distribution rights lost or diminished by
15 reason of the termination, then the small brewer must pay the beer
16 distributor the difference between the payment made to the beer
17 distributor and the determined fair market value plus interest.
18 5. If the arbitration panel rules that the payment made by the
19 small brewer to the beer distributor upon termination was more than
20 the fair market value of distribution rights lost or diminished by
21 reason of the termination, then the beer distributor must pay the
22 small brewer the difference between the payment made to the beer
23 distributor and the determined fair market value, plus interest.

1 6. All arbitration fees and expenses shall be equally divided
2 among the parties to the arbitration, except if the arbitration
3 panel determines that the small brewer's payment upon termination
4 was not a good-faith estimate of the fair market value, then the
5 panel may award up to one hundred percent (100%) of the arbitration
6 costs to the prevailing party.
7 H. 1. Any beer distributor or brewer who is aggrieved by a
8 violation of any provision of this section shall be entitled to the

12 distribution rights and purchase any remaining non-expired inventory
13 for laid in cost. Damages shall be sought in a civil action in any
14 court of competent jurisdiction.
15 2. Any dispute arising under this section may also be settled
16 by such dispute resolution procedures as may be provided by a
