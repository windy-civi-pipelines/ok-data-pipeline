14 SECTION 1. NEW LAW A new section of law to be codified
15 in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 3-7-111 of Title 27A, unless
16 there is created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:
17 A. This act shall be known and may be cited as the “Spring
18 Creek Watershed Study Act”.
19 B. The Legislature finds that:
20 1. Increasing pressure from agriculture and residential

1 by t he residents of the Spring Creek area and citizens of Oklahoma
2 as a whole as to the continued health of the watershed. The once
3 pristine stream is a prime example of how many similar high quality
4 Ozark waterbodies that draw millions of visitors to the area each
5 year, support water supplies for growing urban centers in Oklahoma,
6 and provide habitat for important wildlife and fisheries resources
7 are threatened without cooperative, voluntary protective action by
8 local communities and other stakeholders;
9 2. Improved voluntary land management practices including soil
10 conservation practices, riparian restoration and protection,
11 reforestation, streambank livestock exclusion, and other methods of
12 stewardship have great potential to improve and protect the quality
13 of water in the Spring Creek watershed while improving the
14 ecological health of the area; and
15 3. It is in the interest of the citizens of this state as a
16 whole and the residents of the Spring Creek watershed that the
17 Oklahoma Conservation Commission, in partnership with other local,
18 state, and federal agencies and nongovernmental organizations,
19 undertake a comprehensive water quality study of Spring Creek to
20 determine the best course of action to protect and improve the
21 health of the aquatic habitat in the watershed.
22 C. It is the intent of the Legislature that the findings of
23 this study will be used to direct implementation of voluntary,
24 incentive-based conservation practices by the Commission in

10 and protect the water quality and aquatic habitat in the Spring
11 Creek watershed through the utilization of voluntary, incentive-
12 based programs.
