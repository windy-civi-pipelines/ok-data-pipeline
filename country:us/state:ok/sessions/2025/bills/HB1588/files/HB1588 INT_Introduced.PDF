1 Wate rshed known as Spring Creek located in Cherokee, Delaware, and
2 Mayes counties near Kansas, Oklahoma, resulting in increased concern
3 by the residents of the Spring Creek area and citizens of Oklahoma
4 as a whole as to the continued health of the watershed. The once
5 pristine stream is a prime example of how many similar high quality
6 Ozark waterbodies that draw millions of visitors to the area each
7 year, support water supplies for growing urban centers in Oklahoma,
8 and provide habitat for important wildlife and fisheries resources
9 are threatened without cooperative, voluntary protective action by
10 local communities and other stakeholders;
11 2. Improved voluntary land management practices including soil
12 conservation practices, riparian restoration and protection,
13 reforestation, streambank livestock exclusion, and other methods of
14 stewardship have great potential to improve and protect the quality
15 of water in the Spring Creek watershed while improving the
16 ecological health of the area; and
17 3. It is in the interest of the citizens of this state as a
18 whole and the residents of the Spring Creek watershed that the
19 Oklahoma Conservation Commission, in partnership with other local,
20 state, and federal agencies and nongovernmental organizations
21 undertake a comprehensive water quality study of Spring Creek to
22 determine the best course of action to protect and improve the
23 health of the aquatic habitat in the watershed.
