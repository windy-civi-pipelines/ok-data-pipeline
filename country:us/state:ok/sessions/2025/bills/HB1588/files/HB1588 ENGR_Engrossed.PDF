18 SECTION 1. NEW LAW A new section of law to be codified
19 in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 3-7-111 of Title 27A, unless

1 1. Increasing pressure from agriculture and residential
2 development as well as stream bank erosion and other activities have
3 led to declining water quality levels in the Northeast Oklahoma
4 watershed known as Spring Creek located in Cherokee, Delaware, and
5 Mayes counties near Kansas, Oklahoma, resulting in increased concern
6 by the residents of the Spring Creek area and citizens of Oklahoma
7 as a whole as to the continued health of the watershed. The once
8 pristine stream is a prime example of how many similar high quality
9 Ozark waterbodies that draw millions of visitors to the area each
10 year, support water supplies for growing urban centers in Oklahoma,
11 and provide habitat for important wildlife and fisheries resources
12 are threatened without cooperative, voluntary protective action by
13 local communities and other stakeholders;
14 2. Improved voluntary land management practices including soil
15 conservation practices, riparian restoration and protection,
16 reforestation, streambank livestock exclusion, and other methods of
17 stewardship have great potential to improve and protect the quality
18 of water in the Spring Creek watershed while improving the
19 ecological health of the area; and
20 3. It is in the interest of the citizens of this state as a
21 whole and the residents of the Spring Creek watershed that the
22 Oklahoma Conservation Commission, in partnership with other local,
23 state, and federal agencies and nongovernmental organizations,
24 undertake a comprehensive water quality study of Spring Creek to

1 dete rmine the best course of action to protect and improve the
2 health of the aquatic habitat in the watershed.
3 C. It is the intent of the Legislature that the findings of
4 this study will be used to direct implementation of voluntary,
5 incentive-based conservation practices by the Commission in
6 partnership with other local, state, and federal agencies and
7 subject to availability of resources, in the Spring Creek watershed
8 to protect and improve the aquatic habitat and water quality in the
9 area.
10 SECTION 2. NEW LAW A new section of law to be codified
11 in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 3-7-112 of Title 27A, unless

14 comprehensive watershed-based water quality plan designed to improve
15 and protect the water quality and aquatic habitat in the Spring
16 Creek watershed through the utilization of voluntary, incentive-
17 based programs.
18 2. On or before June 1, 2026, the Commission shall publish an
19 electronic report of the findings. The Commission may, from time to
20 time, update such findings as conditions change and pertinent
