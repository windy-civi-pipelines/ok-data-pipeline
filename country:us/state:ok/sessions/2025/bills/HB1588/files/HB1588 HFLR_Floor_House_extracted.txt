1 A. This act shall be known and may be cited as the “Spring
2 Creek Watershed Study Act”.
3 B. The Legislature finds that:
4 1. Increasing pressure from agriculture and residential
5 development as well as stream bank erosion and other activities have
6 led to declining water quality levels in the Northeast Oklahoma
7 Watershed known as Spring Creek located in Cherokee, Delaware, and
8 Mayes counties near Kansas, Oklahoma, resulting in increased concern
9 by the residents of the Spring Creek area and citizens of Oklahoma
10 as a whole as to the continued health of the watershed. The once
11 pristine stream is a prime example of how many similar high quality
12 Ozark waterbodies that draw millions of visitors to the area each
13 year, support water supplies for growing urban centers in Oklahoma,
14 and provide habitat for important wildlife and fisheries resources
15 are threatened without cooperative, voluntary protective action by
16 local communities and other stakeholders;
17 2. Improved voluntary land management practices including soil
18 conservation practices, riparian restoration and protection,
19 reforestation, streambank livestock exclusion, and other methods of
20 stewardship have great potential to improve and protect the quality
21 of water in the Spring Creek watershed while improving the
22 ecological health of the area; and
23 3. It is in the interest of the citizens of this state as a
24 whole and the residents of the Spring Creek watershed that the

3 undertake a comprehensive water quality study of Spring Creek to
4 determine the best course of action to protect and improve the
5 health of the aquatic habitat in the watershed.
6 C. It is the intent of the Legislature that the findings of
7 this study will be used to direct implementation of voluntary,
8 incentive-based conservation practices by the Commission in
9 partnership with other local, state, and federal agencies and
10 subject to availability of resources, in the Spring Creek watershed
11 to protect and improve the aquatic habitat and water quality in the

17 comprehensive watershed-based water quality plan designed to improve

19 Creek watershed through the utilization of voluntary, incentive-
20 based programs.

24 information becomes available.
