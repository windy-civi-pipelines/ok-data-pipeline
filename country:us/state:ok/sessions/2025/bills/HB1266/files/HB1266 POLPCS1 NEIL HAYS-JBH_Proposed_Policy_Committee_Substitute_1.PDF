17 claims of loss. Personal property shall include everything in a
18 vehicle except the vehicle, the attached or installed equipment,
19 vehicle keys or devices to start and unlock the vehicle, and the
20 spare tire and tools to change the tire. Interlock devices may be

19 to be presented to an insurance company for payment by the wrecker
20 or towing service. A wrecker or towing service may hold the vehicle
