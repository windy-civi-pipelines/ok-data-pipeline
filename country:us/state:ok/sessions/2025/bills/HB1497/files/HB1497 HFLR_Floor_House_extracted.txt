3 a. the NAIC Liquidity Stress Test Framework includes
4 Scope Criteria applicable to a specific data year.

7 Any change to the NAIC Liquidity Stress Test Framework

19 threshold of the Scope Criteria are considered scoped
20 out of the NAIC Liquidity Stress Test Framework for
21 the specified data year, unless the lead state

23 Financial Stability Task Force or its successor,
24 determines the insurer should be scoped into the

2 avoid having insurers scoped in and out of the NAIC

9 specific year's Liquidity Stress Test shall comply
10 with the NAIC Liquidity Stress Test Framework's
11 instructions and reporting templates for that year and

13 in consultation with the Financial Stability Task
14 Force or its successor, provided within the Framework.
15 M. The failure to file a registration statement or any summary
16 of the registration statement or enterprise risk filing required by

7 lead state to comply with the NAIC group
8 supervision approach, as detailed in the NAIC
9 Financial Analysis Handbook, and
10 (2) whose non-United-States group-wide supervisor
11 that is not in a reciprocal jurisdiction

13 commissioner in regulation, the group capital
14 calculation as the world-wide group capital
15 assessment for U.S. insurance groups who operate
16 in that jurisdiction,
17 e. notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraphs c and
18 d of paragraph 2 of subsection L of this section, a

7 the ultimate controlling person from filing the annual
8 group capital calculation or to accept a limited group
9 capital filing or report in accordance with criteria
10 as specified by the commissioner in regulation, and
11 g. if the lead state commissioner determines that an
12 insurance holding company system no longer meets one
13 or more of the requirements for an exemption from

1 by t he procedures within the Financial Analysis Handbook adopted by
2 the NAIC:
3 a. the NAIC Liquidity Stress Test Framework includes
4 Scope Criteria applicable to a specific data year.
5 These Scope Criteria are reviewed at least annually by
6 the Financial Stability Task Force or its successor.
7 Any change to the NAIC Liquidity Stress Test Framework
8 or to the data year for which the Scope Criteria are
9 to be measured shall be effective on January 1 of the
10 year following the calendar year when such changes are
11 adopted. Insurers meeting at least one threshold of
12 the Scope Criteria are considered scoped into the NAIC
13 Liquidity Stress Test Framework for the specified data
14 year unless the lead state insurance commissioner, in
15 consultation with the NAIC Financial Stability Task
16 Force or its successor, determines the insurer should
17 not be scoped into the Framework for that data year.
18 Similarly, insurers that do not trigger at least one
19 threshold of the Scope Criteria are considered scoped
20 out of the NAIC Liquidity Stress Test Framework for
21 the specified data year, unless the lead state
22 insurance commissioner, in consultation with the NAIC
23 Financial Stability Task Force or its successor,
24 determines the insurer should be scoped into the
HB1497 HFLR Page 16

1 Framework for that data year. Regulators wish to
2 avoid having insurers scoped in and out of the NAIC
3 Liquidity Stress Test Framework on a frequent basis.
4 The lead state insurance commissioner, in consultation
5 with the Financial Stability Task Force or its
6 successor, will assess this concern as part of the
7 determination for an insurer, and
8 b. the performance of, and filing of the results from, a
9 specific year's Liquidity Stress Test shall comply
10 with the NAIC Liquidity Stress Test Framework's
11 instructions and reporting templates for that year and
12 any lead state insurance commissioner determinations,
13 in consultation with the Financial Stability Task
14 Force or its successor, provided within the Framework.
15 M. The failure to file a registration statement or any summary
16 of the registration statement or enterprise risk filing required by

18 violation of this section.
