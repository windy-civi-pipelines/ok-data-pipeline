3. Either paragraph 2 of subsection A of Section 6 1636 of this
act title or a provision such as the following: Each registered
insurer shall keep current the information required to be disclosed

subject to subsection B of Section 6 1636 of this act title, each
registered insurer shall so report all dividends and other

the declaration thereof.
Any insurer which is subject to registration under this section
shall register within fifteen (15) days after it becomes subject to
registration, and annually thereafter by May 1 of each year for the
previous calendar year, unless the Commissioner for good cause shown
extends the time for registration, and then within the extended
time. The Commissioner may require any insurer authorized to do
business in the state which is a member of an insurance holding

section, to furnish a copy of the registration statement, the
summary specified in subsection C of this section or other
information filed by the insurance company with the insurance
regulatory authority of its domiciliary jurisdiction.

the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Exchange

C. All registration statements shall contain a summary
outlining all items in the current registration statement

D. No information need be disclosed on the registration
statement filed pursuant to subsection B of this section if the
information is not material for the purposes of this section.
Unless the Commissioner by rule, regulation or order provides
otherwise, sales, purchases, exchanges, loans or extensions of
credit, investments, or guarantees involving one-half of one percent
(.5%) or less of an insurer's admitted assets as of December 31 next
preceding shall not be deemed material for purposes of this section.
The definition of materiality provided in this subsection shall not
apply for purposes of the Group Capital Calculation Instructions or
the Liquidity Stress Test Framework.
E. Subject to subsection B of Section 6 1636 of this act title,
each registered insurer shall report to the Commissioner all
dividends and other distributions to shareholders within fifteen
(15) business days following the declaration thereof.
F. Any person within an insurance holding company system
subject to registration shall be required to provide complete and

section.
ENR. H. B. NO. 1497 Page 7

J. The provisions of this section shall not apply to any
insurer, information or transaction if and to the extent that the
Commissioner by rule, regulation or order shall exempt the same from
the provisions of this section.
K. Any person may file with the Commissioner a disclaimer of
affiliation with any authorized insurer or a disclaimer may be filed
by the insurer or any member of an insurance holding company system.
The disclaimer shall fully disclose all material relationships and
bases for affiliation between the person and the insurer as well as
the basis for disclaiming the affiliation. A disclaimer of
affiliation shall be deemed to have been granted unless the
Commissioner, within thirty (30) days following receipt of a
complete disclaimer, notifies the filing party the disclaimer is
disallowed. In the event of disallowance, the disclaiming party may
request an administrative hearing, which shall be granted. The
disclaiming party shall be relieved of its duty to register under
this section if approval of the disclaimer has been granted by the
Commissioner, or if the disclaimer is deemed to have been approved.
L. 1. The ultimate controlling person of every insurer subject
to registration shall also file an annual enterprise risk report.
The report shall, to the best of the ultimate controlling person's
knowledge and belief, identify the material risks within the
insurance holding company system that could pose enterprise risk to
the insurer. The report shall be filed with the lead state
Commissioner of the insurance holding company system as determined
by the procedures within the Financial Analysis Handbook adopted by
the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.
2. Except as provided below, the ultimate controlling person of
every insurer subject to registration shall concurrently file with
the registration an annual group capital calculation as directed by
the lead state Commissioner. The report shall be completed in
accordance with the NAIC Group Capital Calculation Instructions,
which may permit the lead state Commissioner to allow a controlling
person that is not the ultimate controlling person to file the group
capital calculation. The report shall be filed with the lead state
Commissioner of the insurance holding company system as determined
by the commissioner in accordance with the procedures within the
Financial Analysis Handbook adopted by the NAIC. Insurance holding
company systems described below are exempt from filing the group
capital calculation:
ENR. H. B. NO. 1497 Page 8

a. an insurance holding company system that has only one
insurer within its holding company structure, that
only writes business in its domestic state, and
assumes no business from any other insurer,
b. an insurance holding company system that is required
to perform a group capital calculation specified by
the United States Federal Reserve Board. The lead
state Commissioner shall request the calculation from
the Federal Reserve Board under the terms of
information sharing agreements in effect. If the
Federal Reserve Board cannot share the calculation
with the lead state Commissioner, the insurance
holding company system is not exempt from the group
capital calculation filing,
c. an insurance holding company system whose non-United
States group-wide supervisor is located within a
reciprocal jurisdiction as described in Section 5122
of Title 36 of the Oklahoma Statutes that recognizes
the United States state regulatory approach to group
supervision and group capital,
d. an insurance holding company system:
(1) that provides information to the lead state that
meets the requirements for accreditation under
the NAIC financial standards and accreditation
program, either directly or indirectly through
the group-wide supervisor, who has determined
such information is satisfactory to allow the
lead state to comply with the NAIC group
supervision approach, as detailed in the NAIC
Financial Analysis Handbook, and
(2) whose non-United States group-wide supervisor
that is not in a reciprocal jurisdiction
recognizes and accepts, as specified by the
commissioner in regulation, the group capital
calculation as the world-wide group capital
assessment for United States insurance groups who
operate in that jurisdiction,
e. notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraphs c and
d of paragraph 2 of subsection L of this section, a
ENR. H. B. NO. 1497 Page 9

lead state Commissioner shall require the group
capital calculation for U.S. operations of any non-
United States-based insurance holding company system
where, after any necessary consultation with other
supervisors or officials, it is deemed appropriate by
the lead state Commissioner for prudential oversight
and solvency monitoring purposes or for ensuring the
competitiveness of the insurance marketplace,
f. notwithstanding the exemptions from filing the group
capital calculation stated in subparagraphs a through
d of paragraph 2 of subsection L of this section, the
lead state Commissioner has the discretion to exempt
the ultimate controlling person from filing the annual
group capital calculation or to accept a limited group
capital filing or report in accordance with criteria
as specified by the commissioner in regulation, and
g. if the lead state Commissioner determines that an
insurance holding company system no longer meets one
or more of the requirements for an exemption from
filing the group capital calculation under this
section, the insurance holding company system shall
file the group capital calculation at the next annual
filing date unless given an extension by the lead
state Commissioner based on reasonable grounds shown;
3. The ultimate controlling person of every insurer subject to
registration and also scoped into the NAIC Liquidity Stress Test
Framework shall file the results of a specific year's Liquidity
Stress Test. The filing shall be made to the lead state insurance
commissioner of the insurance holding company system as determined
by the procedures within the Financial Analysis Handbook adopted by
the NAIC:
a. the NAIC Liquidity Stress Test Framework includes
Scope Criteria applicable to a specific data year.
These Scope Criteria are reviewed at least annually by
the Financial Stability Task Force or its successor.
Any change to the NAIC Liquidity Stress Test Framework
or to the data year for which the Scope Criteria are
to be measured shall be effective on January 1 of the
year following the calendar year when such changes are
adopted. Insurers meeting at least one threshold of
the Scope Criteria are considered scoped into the NAIC
ENR. H. B. NO. 1497 Page 10

Liquidity Stress Test Framework for the specified data
year unless the lead state insurance commissioner, in
consultation with the NAIC Financial Stability Task
Force or its successor, determines the insurer should
not be scoped into the Framework for that data year.
Similarly, insurers that do not trigger at least one
threshold of the Scope Criteria are considered scoped
out of the NAIC Liquidity Stress Test Framework for
the specified data year, unless the lead state
insurance commissioner, in consultation with the NAIC
Financial Stability Task Force or its successor,
determines the insurer should be scoped into the
Framework for that data year. Regulators wish to
avoid having insurers scoped in and out of the NAIC
Liquidity Stress Test Framework on a frequent basis.
The lead state insurance commissioner, in consultation
with the Financial Stability Task Force or its
successor, will assess this concern as part of the
determination for an insurer, and
b. the performance of, and filing of the results from, a
specific year's Liquidity Stress Test shall comply
with the NAIC Liquidity Stress Test Framework's
instructions and reporting templates for that year and
any lead state insurance commissioner determinations,
in consultation with the Financial Stability Task
Force or its successor, provided within the Framework.
M. The failure to file a registration statement or any summary
of the registration statement or enterprise risk filing required by
this section within the time specified for filing shall be a
violation of this section.

amended to read as follows:
Section 1640. A. Documents, materials or other information in
the possession or control of the Insurance Department that are

maintain the confidentiality and privileged status of
the documents, materials or other information and has
verified in writing the legal authority to maintain
such confidentiality,

NAIC and its affiliates and subsidiaries or a third-

Commissioner,
c. excluding documents, material or information reported

1635 of this title, in the case of an agreement
involving a third-party consultant, provide for
notification of the identity of the consultant to the
applicable insurers.
D. The sharing of information by the Commissioner pursuant to
this act shall not constitute a delegation of regulatory authority
or rulemaking, and the Commissioner is solely responsible for the
administration, execution and enforcement of the provisions of this
act.
E. No waiver of any applicable privilege or claim of
confidentiality in the documents, materials or information shall
occur as a result of disclosure to the Commissioner under this
section or as a result of sharing as authorized in subsection C of
this section.

Commissioner pursuant to this act shall be confidential by law and

ratio required under paragraph 2 of subsection L of Section 1635 of
this title and the Liquidity Stress Test along with its results and
supporting disclosures required under paragraph 3 of subsection L of
Section 1635 of this title are regulatory tools for assessing group
risks and capital adequacy and group liquidity risks, respectively,
and are not intended as a means to rank insurers or insurance
holding company systems generally. Therefore, except as otherwise
may be required under the provisions of this title, the making,
publishing, disseminating, circulating or placing before the public,
or causing directly or indirectly to be made, published,
disseminated, circulated or placed before the public in a newspaper,
magazine or other publication, or in the form of a notice, circular,
pamphlet, letter or poster, or over any radio or television station
or any electronic means of communication available to the public, or
in any other way as an advertisement, announcement or statement
containing a representation or statement with regard to the group
capital calculation, group capital ratio, the Liquidity Stress Test
results, or supporting disclosures for the Liquidity Stress Test of
any insurer or any insurer group, or of any component derived in the
ENR. H. B. NO. 1497 Page 15

calculation by an insurer, broker, or other person engaged in any
manner in the insurance business would be misleading and is
therefore prohibited; provided however, that if any materially false
statement with respect to the group capital calculation, resulting
group capital ratio, an inappropriate comparison of any amount to an
insurer's or insurance group's group capital calculation or
resulting group capital ratio, Liquidity Stress Test result,
supporting disclosures for the Liquidity Stress Test, or an
inappropriate comparison of any amount to an insurer's or insurance
group's Liquidity Stress Test result or supporting disclosures is
published in any written publication and the insurer is able to
demonstrate to the Commissioner with substantial proof the falsity
of such statement or the inappropriateness, as the case may be, then
the insurer may publish announcements in a written publication if
the sole purpose of the announcement is to rebut the materially
false statement.
