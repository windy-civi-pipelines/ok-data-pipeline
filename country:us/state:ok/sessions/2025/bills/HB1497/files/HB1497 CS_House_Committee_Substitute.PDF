23 such information is satisfactory to allow the
24 lead state to comply with the NAIC group
Req. No. 13015 Page 13
1 supervision approach, as detailed in the NAIC
2 Financial Analysis Handbook, and
3 (2) whose non-United-States group-wide supervisor
4 that is not in a reciprocal jurisdiction
5 recognizes and accepts, as specified by the
6 commissioner in regulation, the group capital
7 calculation as the world-wide group capital
8 assessment for U.S. insurance groups who operate
9 in that jurisdiction,
10 e. notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraphs c and
11 d of paragraph 2 of subsection L of this section, a
12 lead state commissioner shall require the group
13 capital calculation for U.S. operations of any non-

Req. No. 13015 Page 14
1 group capital calculation or to accept a limited group
2 capital filing or report in accordance with criteria
3 as specified by the commissioner in regulation, and
4 g. if the lead state commissioner determines that an
5 insurance holding company system no longer meets one
6 or more of the requirements for an exemption from
7 filing the group capital calculation under this
8 section, the insurance holding company system shall
9 file the group capital calculation at the next annual
10 filing date unless given an extension by the lead
11 state commissioner based on reasonable grounds shown;
12 3. The ultimate controlling person of every insurer subject to
13 registration and also scoped into the NAIC Liquidity Stress Test
14 Framework shall file the results of a specific year's Liquidity
15 Stress Test. The filing shall be made to the lead state insurance
16 commissioner of the insurance holding company system as determined
17 by the procedures within the Financial Analysis Handbook adopted by
18 the NAIC:
19 a. the NAIC Liquidity Stress Test Framework includes
20 Scope Criteria applicable to a specific data year.
21 These Scope Criteria are reviewed at least annually by
22 the Financial Stability Task Force or its successor.
23 Any change to the NAIC Liquidity Stress Test Framework
24 or to the data year for which the Scope Criteria are
Req. No. 13015 Page 15
1 to be measured shall be effective on January 1 of the
2 year following the calendar year when such changes are
3 adopted. Insurers meeting at least one threshold of
4 the Scope Criteria are considered scoped into the NAIC
5 Liquidity Stress Test Framework for the specified data
6 year unless the lead state insurance commissioner, in
7 consultation with the NAIC Financial Stability Task
8 Force or its successor, determines the insurer should
9 not be scoped into the Framework for that data year.
10 Similarly, insurers that do not trigger at least one
11 threshold of the Scope Criteria are considered scoped
12 out of the NAIC Liquidity Stress Test Framework for
13 the specified data year, unless the lead state
14 insurance commissioner, in consultation with the NAIC
15 Financial Stability Task Force or its successor,
16 determines the insurer should be scoped into the
17 Framework for that data year. Regulators wish to
18 avoid having insurers scoped in and out of the NAIC
19 Liquidity Stress Test Framework on a frequent basis.
20 The lead state insurance commissioner, in consultation
21 with the Financial Stability Task Force or its
22 successor, will assess this concern as part of the
23 determination for an insurer, and
24
Req. No. 13015 Page 16
1 b. the performance of, and filing of the results from, a
2 specific year's Liquidity Stress Test shall comply

7 Force or its successor, provided within the Framework.

9 of the registration statement or enterprise risk filing required by
10 this section within the time specified for filing shall be a
11 violation of this section.

17 d. an insurance holding company system:
18 (1) that provides information to the lead state that
19 meets the requirements for accreditation under
20 the NAIC financial standards and accreditation
21 program, either directly or indirectly through
22 the group-wide supervisor, who has determined
23 such information is satisfactory to allow the
24 lead state to comply with the NAIC group
Req. No. 13015 Page 13

1 supervision approach, as detailed in the NAIC
2 Financial Analysis Handbook, and
3 (2) whose non-United-States group-wide supervisor
4 that is not in a reciprocal jurisdiction
5 recognizes and accepts, as specified by the
6 commissioner in regulation, the group capital
7 calculation as the world-wide group capital
8 assessment for U.S. insurance groups who operate
9 in that jurisdiction,
10 e. notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraphs c and
11 d of paragraph 2 of subsection L of this section, a
12 lead state commissioner shall require the group
13 capital calculation for U.S. operations of any non-
14 United-States based insurance holding company system

16 supervisors or officials, it is deemed appropriate by
17 the lead state commissioner for prudential oversight
18 and solvency monitoring purposes or for ensuring the
19 competitiveness of the insurance marketplace,
20 f. notwithstanding the exemptions from filing the group
21 capital calculation stated in subparagraphs a through
22 d of paragraph 2 of subsection L of this section, the
23 lead state commissioner has the discretion to exempt
24 the ultimate controlling person from filing the annual
Req. No. 13015 Page 14

1 group capital calculation or to accept a limited group
2 capital filing or report in accordance with criteria
3 as specified by the commissioner in regulation, and
4 g. if the lead state commissioner determines that an
5 insurance holding company system no longer meets one
6 or more of the requirements for an exemption from
7 filing the group capital calculation under this
8 section, the insurance holding company system shall
9 file the group capital calculation at the next annual
10 filing date unless given an extension by the lead
11 state commissioner based on reasonable grounds shown;
12 3. The ultimate controlling person of every insurer subject to
13 registration and also scoped into the NAIC Liquidity Stress Test
14 Framework shall file the results of a specific year's Liquidity
15 Stress Test. The filing shall be made to the lead state insurance
16 commissioner of the insurance holding company system as determined
17 by the procedures within the Financial Analysis Handbook adopted by
18 the NAIC:
19 a. the NAIC Liquidity Stress Test Framework includes
20 Scope Criteria applicable to a specific data year.
21 These Scope Criteria are reviewed at least annually by
22 the Financial Stability Task Force or its successor.
23 Any change to the NAIC Liquidity Stress Test Framework
24 or to the data year for which the Scope Criteria are
Req. No. 13015 Page 15

1 to be measured shall be effective on January 1 of the
2 year following the calendar year when such changes are
3 adopted. Insurers meeting at least one threshold of
4 the Scope Criteria are considered scoped into the NAIC
5 Liquidity Stress Test Framework for the specified data
6 year unless the lead state insurance commissioner, in
7 consultation with the NAIC Financial Stability Task
8 Force or its successor, determines the insurer should
9 not be scoped into the Framework for that data year.
10 Similarly, insurers that do not trigger at least one
11 threshold of the Scope Criteria are considered scoped
12 out of the NAIC Liquidity Stress Test Framework for
13 the specified data year, unless the lead state
14 insurance commissioner, in consultation with the NAIC
15 Financial Stability Task Force or its successor,
16 determines the insurer should be scoped into the
17 Framework for that data year. Regulators wish to
18 avoid having insurers scoped in and out of the NAIC
19 Liquidity Stress Test Framework on a frequent basis.
20 The lead state insurance commissioner, in consultation
21 with the Financial Stability Task Force or its
22 successor, will assess this concern as part of the
23 determination for an insurer, and
24
Req. No. 13015 Page 16

1 b. the performance of, and filing of the results from, a
2 specific year's Liquidity Stress Test shall comply
3 with the NAIC Liquidity Stress Test Framework's
4 instructions and reporting templates for that year and
5 any lead state insurance commissioner determinations,
6 in consultation with the Financial Stability Task
7 Force or its successor, provided within the Framework.
8 M. The failure to file a registration statement or any summary
9 of the registration statement or enterprise risk filing required by
10 this section within the time specified for filing shall be a
11 violation of this section.
12 SECTION 3. AMENDATORY 36 O.S. 2021, Section 1640, is
13 amended to read as follows:
14 Section 1640. A. Documents, materials or other information in
15 the possession or control of the Insurance Department that are

17 the course of an examination or investigation made pursuant to

20 13 of subsection B of Section 3 1633 of this act title, Section 5
21 1635 of this act title, Section 6 1636 of this act title, and

24 confidential by law and privileged, shall not be subject to open
Req. No. 13015 Page 17

1 reco rds, or freedom of information, shall not be subject to
2 subpoena, and shall not be subject to discovery or admissible in
3 evidence in any private civil action. However, the Commissioner is
4 authorized to use the documents, materials or other information in
5 the furtherance of any regulatory or legal action brought as a part
6 of the Commissioner's official duties. The Commissioner shall not
7 otherwise make the documents, materials or other information public
8 without the prior written consent of the insurer to which it
9 pertains unless the Commissioner, after giving the insurer and its
10 affiliates who would be affected thereby notice and opportunity to
11 be heard, determines that the interest of policyholders,
