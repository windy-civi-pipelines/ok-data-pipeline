SECTION 1. AMENDATORY 63 O.S. 2021, Section 425, as
13
14
amended by Section 10, Chapter 182, O.S.L. 2024 (63 O.S. Supp. 2024,
14
15
Section 425), is amended to read as follows:
15
16
Section 425. A. No school or landlord may refuse to enroll or
16
17
lease to and may not otherwise penalize a person solely for his or
17
18
her status as a licensed medical marijuana patient, unless failing
18
19
to do so would cause the school or landlord the potential to lose a
19
20
monetary or licensing-related benefit under federal law or
20
21
regulations.
21
22
B. 1. Unless a failure to do so would cause an employer the
22
23
potential to lose a monetary or licensing-related benefit under
23
24
federal law or regulations, an employer may not discriminate against
24
Req. No. 1447 Page 1

1
a person in hiring, termination terminating or imposing any term or
1
2
condition of employment or otherwise penalize a person based upon
2
3
the status of the person as a licensed medical marijuana patient.
3
4
2. Employers may take action against a licensed medical
4
5
marijuana patient if the licensed medical marijuana patient uses or
5
6
possesses marijuana while in his or her place of employment or
6
7
during the hours of employment. Employers may not take action
7
8
against the licensed medical marijuana patient solely based upon the
8
9
status of an employee as a licensed medical marijuana patient or the
9
10
results of a drug test showing positive for marijuana or its
10
11
components.
11
12
C. For the purposes of medical care, including organ
12
13
transplants, the authorized use of marijuana by a licensed medical
13
14
marijuana patient shall be considered the equivalent of the use of
14
15
any other medication under the direction of a physician and does not
15
16
constitute the use of an illicit substance or otherwise disqualify a
16
17
registered qualifying patient from medical care.
17
18
D. No licensed medical marijuana patient may be denied custody
18
19
of or visitation or parenting time with a minor child, and there is
19
20
no presumption of neglect or child endangerment for conduct allowed
20
21
under this law, unless the behavior of the person creates an
21
22
unreasonable danger to the safety of the minor child.
22
23
E. No licensed medical marijuana patient may unduly be withheld
23
24
from holding a state-issued license by virtue of their being a
24
Req. No. 1447 Page 2

1
licensed medical marijuana patient including, but not limited to, a
1
2
concealed carry permit.
2
3
F. 1. No city or local municipality may unduly change or
3
4
restrict zoning laws to prevent the opening of a medical marijuana
4
5
dispensary.
5
6
2. For purposes of this subsection, an undue change or
6
7
restriction of municipal zoning laws means an act which entirely
7
8
prevents medical marijuana dispensaries from operating within
8
9
municipal boundaries as a matter of law. Municipalities may follow
9
10
their standard planning and zoning procedures to determine if
10
11
certain zones or districts would be appropriate for locating
11
12
marijuana-licensed premises, medical marijuana businesses or any
12
13
other premises where marijuana or its by-products are cultivated,
13
14
grown, processed, stored or manufactured.
14
15
3. For purposes of this section, a medical marijuana dispensary
15
16
does not include those other entities licensed by the Oklahoma
16
17
Medical Marijuana Authority as marijuana-licensed premises, medical
17
18
marijuana businesses or other facilities or locations where
18
19
marijuana or any product containing marijuana or its by-products
19
20
byproducts are cultivated, grown, processed, stored or manufactured.
20
21
G. 1. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the
21
22
location of any medical marijuana dispensary is specifically
22
23
prohibited within one thousand (1,000) three thousand (3,000) feet
23
24
of any school entrance. On and after the effective date of this act
24
Req. No. 1447 Page 3

1
May 28, 2021, for purposes of calculating the 1,000-foot three-
1
2
thousand-foot setback distance, the measurement shall be determined
2
3
by calculating the distance in a straight line from the school door
3
4
nearest the front door of the retail marijuana dispensary to the
4
5
front door of the retail marijuana dispensary.
5
6
2. On and after June 26, 2018, if any school is established
6
7
within one thousand (1,000) three thousand (3,000) feet of any
7
8
retail marijuana dispensary after a license has been issued by the
8
9
Authority for that location, the setback distance between properties
9
10
shall not apply as long as the licensed property is used for its
10
11
original licensed purpose. The licensed location shall be
11
12
grandfathered in as to the setback distance as long as the property
12
13
is used in accordance with the original licensed purpose.
13
14
3. On and after June 26, 2018, the Authority, due to an error
14
15
in measurement of the setback distance or failure to measure the
15
16
setback distance by the Authority prior to issuance of an original
16
17
license at a location, shall not:
17
18
a. deny any issuance or renewal of a license at that
18
19
location,
19
20
b. deny any transfer of license pursuant to a change in
20
21
ownership at that location, or
21
22
c. revoke any license due to an error in measurement or
22
23
failure to measure the setback distance, except as
23
24
otherwise provided by law.
24
Req. No. 1447 Page 4

1
The retail marijuana dispensary shall be grandfathered in as to
1
2
the setback distance, subject only to the municipal compliance
2
3
provisions of Section 426.1 of this title.
3
4
4. For purposes of this subsection and subsection H of this
4
5
section:
5
6
a. “school” means the same as defined in Section 427.2 of
6
7
this title, and
7
8
b. “error in measurement” means a mistake made by the
8
9
Authority or a municipality in the setback measurement
9
10
process where either the distance between a retail
10
11
marijuana dispensary and a school is miscalculated due
11
12
to mathematical error or the method used to measure
12
13
the setback distance is inconsistent with this
13
14
section. The setback measurement process is allowed
14
15
an error in measurement up to and including five
15
16
hundred (500) feet when remeasured after an original
16
17
license has been issued.
17
18
H. The location of any medical marijuana commercial grower
18
19
shall not be within one thousand (1,000) three thousand (3,000) feet
19
20
of any school as measured from the nearest property line of such
20
21
school to the nearest property line of the licensed premises of such
21
22
medical marijuana commercial grower. Additionally, the location of
22
23
the medical marijuana commercial grower shall not adjoin to any
23
24
school or be located at the same physical address as the school. If
24
Req. No. 1447 Page 5

1
a medical marijuana commercial grower met the requirements of this
1
2
subsection at the time of its initial licensure, the medical
2
3
marijuana commercial grower licensee shall be permitted to continue
3
4
operating at the licensed premises in the same manner and not be
4
5
subject to nonrenewal or revocation due to subsequent events or
5
6
changes in regulations occurring after licensure that would render
6
7
the medical marijuana commercial grower in violation of this
7
8
subsection. If any school is established within one thousand
8
9
(1,000) three thousand (3,000) feet of any medical marijuana
9
10
commercial grower after such medical marijuana commercial grower has
10
11
been licensed, or if any school is established adjoining to or at
11
12
the same physical address as any medical marijuana commercial grower
12
13
after such medical marijuana commercial grower has been licensed,
13
14
the provisions of this subsection shall not be a deterrent to the
14
15
renewal of such license or warrant revocation of the license. For
15
16
purposes of this subsection, a property owned, used, or operated by
16
17
a school that is not used for classroom instruction on core
17
18
curriculum, such as an administrative building, athletic facility,
18
19
ballpark, field, or stadium, shall not constitute a school unless
19
20
such property is located on the same campus as a building used for
20
21
classroom instruction on core curriculum.
21
22
SECTION 2. This act shall become effective November 1, 2025.
