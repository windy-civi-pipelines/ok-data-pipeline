18 lease to and may not otherwise penalize a person solely for his or

24 potential to lose a monetary or licensing-related benefit under

16 grown, processed, stored or manufactured.
17 3. For purposes of this section, a medical marijuana dispensary

3 effective date of this act. On and after the effective date of this
4 act May 28, 2021, for purposes of calculating the 1,000-foot three-

6 by calculating the distance in a straight line from the school door
7 nearest the front door of the retail marijuana dispensary to the
8 front door of the retail marijuana dispensary.
9 2. On and after June 26, 2018 the effective date of this act,
10 if any school is established within one thousand (1,000) three
11 thousand (3,000) feet of any retail marijuana dispensary after a
12 license has been issued by the Authority for that location, the
13 setback distance between properties shall not apply as long as the

16 distance as long as the property is used in accordance with the
17 original licensed purpose.
18 3. On and after the effective date of this act, if any place of
19 worship is established within three thousand (3,000) feet of any
20 retail marijuana dispensary after a license has been issued by the

22 shall not apply as long as the licensed property is used for its

8 location,

14 The retail marijuana dispensary shall be grandfathered in as to
15 the setback distance, subject only to the municipal compliance
16 provisions of Section 426.1 of this title.
17 4. 5. For purposes of this subsection and subsection H of this
18 section:
19 a. “school” means the same as defined in Section 427.2 of
20 this title, and
21 b. “error in measurement” means a mistake made by the
22 Authority or a municipality in the setback measurement
23 process where either the distance between a retail
24 marijuana dispensary and a school is miscalculated due
ENGR. S. B. NO. 640 Page 5
1 to mathematical error or the method used to measure
2 the setback distance is inconsistent with this
3 section. The setback measurement process is allowed

5 hundred (500) feet when remeasured after an original
6 license has been issued, and
7 c. “place of worship” means any permanent building,
8 structure, facility, or office space owned, leased, or

18 medical marijuana commercial grower. Additionally, the location of
19 the medical marijuana commercial grower shall not adjoin to any
20 school or be located at the same physical address as the school. If

22 subsection at the time of its initial licensure, the medical
23 marijuana commercial grower licensee shall be permitted to continue
24 operating at the licensed premises in the same manner and not be
ENGR. S. B. NO. 640 Page 6
1 subj ect to nonrenewal or revocation due to subsequent events or
2 changes in regulations occurring after licensure that would render

5 (1,000) three thousand (3,000) feet of any medical marijuana
6 commercial grower after such medical marijuana commercial grower has
7 been licensed, or if any school is established adjoining to or at
8 the same physical address as any medical marijuana commercial grower
9 after such medical marijuana commercial grower has been licensed,
10 the provisions of this subsection shall not be a deterrent to the
11 renewal of such license or warrant revocation of the license. For
12 purposes of this subsection, a property owned, used, or operated by
13 a school that is not used for classroom instruction on core
14 curriculum, such as an administrative building, athletic facility,
15 ballpark, field, or stadium, shall not constitute a school unless
16 such property is located on the same campus as a building used for
17 classroom instruction on core curriculum.
18 2. On and after the effective date of this act, if any place of
19 worship is established within three thousand (3,000) feet of any
20 retail marijuana grower after a license has been issued by the

22 shall not apply as long as the licensed property is used for its
23 original licensed purpose. The licensed location shall be
