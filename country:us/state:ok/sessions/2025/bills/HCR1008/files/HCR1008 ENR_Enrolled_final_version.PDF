A Concurrent Resolution related to the severe wind
event of the period beginning March 14, 2025;
recognizing courage and dedication of paid and
volunteer firefighters and firefighting personnel of
Native American tribes; and directing distribution.
WHEREAS, during the period from the morning of Friday, March 14,
2025, continuing into the weekend, Oklahoma experienced
extraordinarily high winds over most of the area of the state; and
WHEREAS, low humidity, high winds and pre-existing drought
conditions created the risk for an outbreak of wildfires; and
WHEREAS, hundreds of wildfires broke out beginning in western
Oklahoma and continuing eastward, damaging or destroying pasture,
crops, barns, buildings, homes, businesses, infrastructure and other
assets; and
WHEREAS, at least four persons lost their lives as a result of
the wildfires or the high winds or a combination of both; and

WHEREAS, hundreds of persons were injured as a result of the
high winds or the wildfires or a combination of both; and
WHEREAS, this type of event strains firefighting personnel and
resources beyond all reasonable limits; and
WHEREAS, the paid and volunteer firefighters in both rural and
incorporated areas, along with the firefighting personnel of many
Native American tribes and many first responders used their training
and expertise to combat the fires, to preserve property, to save
lives, to treat injured persons and to provide all forms of
assistance as required; and
WHEREAS, the efforts of the brave people who engage in
firefighting services and other first responders are always to be
highly valued even without the kind of severe weather event that
triggered the wildfire outbreak; and
WHEREAS, were it not for the combined efforts of the people
engaged in firefighting services across the state, the loss of life
and property and the damage to private property and public
infrastructure would have been far worse; and
WHEREAS, the courage and highest standards of public service
exhibited by the paid and volunteer firefighting personnel and the
firefighting personnel of the Native American tribes and first
responders from all areas of the state should be specially
recognized.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
OF THE 1ST SESSION OF THE 60TH OKLAHOMA LEGISLATURE, THE SENATE
CONCURRING THEREIN:
THAT the Oklahoma House of Representatives and the Oklahoma
State Senate recognize the efforts of paid and volunteer
firefighters, the firefighters of the several Native American tribes
across the State of Oklahoma, and the first responders serving many
governmental entities within the state.
THAT the courage and dedication of all persons engaged in fire
prevention efforts, firefighting efforts and the provision of
emergency medical services during the period of the severe weather
high wind event should be acknowledged.

THAT the Oklahoma House of Representatives and the Oklahoma
State Senate wish to express gratitude and most sincere appreciation
on behalf of all people of the State of Oklahoma for the
professional services, courage, dedication and the spirit of public
service demonstrated by both paid and volunteer firefighters, the
firefighting personnel of several Native American tribes and all
first responders during this critical period of time.
THAT prayers be offered in support of people who have lost their
homes, their businesses, and their belongings.
THAT copies of this resolution be distributed to the Oklahoma
State Firefighters Association, the Oklahoma Fire Chiefs
Association, the Professional Firefighters of Oklahoma and to the
several Native American tribes the firefighting personnel of which
were called into service during the severe weather high wind event.
