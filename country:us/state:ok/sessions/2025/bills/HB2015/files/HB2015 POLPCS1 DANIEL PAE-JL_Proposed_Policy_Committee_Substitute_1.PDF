5 health or safety, the tenant may deliver to the landlord a written
6 notice specifying the acts and omissions constituting the breach and
7 that the rental agreement will terminate upon a date not less than
8 thirty (30) days after receipt of the notice if action to correct

18 title,
19 b. the landlord has been given a reasonable amount of

9 in a workmanlike manner and, after submitting to the landlord an
10 itemized statement, deduct from his or her rent the actual and
11 reasonable cost or the fair and reasonable value of the work, not
12 exceeding the amount specified in this subsection, in which event
13 the rental agreement shall not terminate by reason of that breach.
14 If the cost of necessary repairs exceeds one month's rent, after

16 tenant may withhold payment of rent and immediately deposit it in a
17 separate bank or savings and loan account, written evidence of such
18 action to be provided to the landlord upon deposit, maintained only

23 for.

5 of this section.

10 under Sections 131 or 132 of this title, and the matter is found in
11 favor of the tenant or if the landlord is determined to have brought
12 the action in bad faith, the tenant may recover reasonable attorney
13 fees and damages equivalent to two (2) months rent.
14 E. G. All rights of the tenant under this section do not arise
15 until he or she has given written notice to the landlord or if the
16 condition complained of was caused by the deliberate or negligent
17 act or omission of the tenant, a member of his or her family, his or
18 her animal or pet or other person or animal on the premises with his
19 or her consent.
20 SECTION 2. This act shall become effective November 1, 2025.
