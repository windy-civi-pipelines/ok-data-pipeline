13 WHEREAS, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a chronic cardiac
14 disease involving thickening of the heart muscle and can potentially
15 lead to debilitating symptoms and serious complications including
16 heart failure, atrial fibrillation, stroke, and in rare cases sudden
17 cardiac death; and
18 WHEREAS, HCM is the most common inheritable heart disease and
19 can affect anyone regardless of age, gender, or ethnicity with a
20 reported prevalence ranging from 1 in 200 to 1 in 500 in the general
21 population; and
22 WHEREAS, an estimated 700,000 to 1,650,000 people in the United

1 WHEREAS, HCM shares symptoms with other common cardiovascular
2 and pulmonary diseases, such as shortness of breath, chest pain,
3 fatigue, palpitations, and fainting, making it difficult to
4 distinguish HCM from these other diseases; and
5 WHEREAS, when untreated, all-caused mortality risk is 3 to 4
6 times higher in patients with HCM than that of the general
7 population; and
8 WHEREAS, knowing one's medical history and any signs and
9 symptoms of HCM is an important first step in receiving an accurate
10 diagnosis of HCM; and
11 WHEREAS, a health care provider must conduct a thorough
12 screening with cardiac health questions to help identify a risk of
13 cardiac disorders both genetic and congenital; and
14 WHEREAS, a health care provider may conduct several tests,
15 including an echocardiogram, a cardiac MRI, or genetic testing to
16 confirm a family history of HCM, and must examine the heart to
17 diagnose HCM; and
18 WHEREAS, following a diagnosis of HCM, it is important for
19 patients to work with their health care provider to learn more about
20 their disease and understand different management options, including
21 prescription medications and surgical treatment options that may
22 help; and
23 WHEREAS, the fourth Wednesday in February is an appropriate day
24 to observe Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Awareness Day.
