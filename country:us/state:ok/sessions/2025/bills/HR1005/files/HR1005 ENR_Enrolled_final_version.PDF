RESOLUTION NO. 1005 By: Sneed
A Resolution recognizing February 26, 2025, as
Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Awareness Day at the
State Capitol; and expressing the importance of
Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Awareness Day.
WHEREAS, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a chronic cardiac
disease involving thickening of the heart muscle and can potentially
lead to debilitating symptoms and serious complications including
heart failure, atrial fibrillation, stroke, and in rare cases sudden
cardiac death; and
WHEREAS, HCM is the most common inheritable heart disease and
can affect anyone regardless of age, gender, or ethnicity with a
reported prevalence ranging from 1 in 200 to 1 in 500 in the general
population; and
WHEREAS, an estimated 700,000 to 1,650,000 people in the United
States have HCM, yet 85% of them may remain undiagnosed; and
WHEREAS, HCM shares symptoms with other common cardiovascular
and pulmonary diseases, such as shortness of breath, chest pain,
fatigue, palpitations, and fainting, making it difficult to
distinguish HCM from these other diseases; and
WHEREAS, when untreated, all-caused mortality risk is 3 to 4
times higher in patients with HCM than that of the general
population; and
WHEREAS, knowing one's medical history and any signs and
symptoms of HCM is an important first step in receiving an accurate
diagnosis of HCM; and

WHEREAS, a health care provider must conduct a thorough
screening with cardiac health questions to help identify a risk of
cardiac disorders both genetic and congenital; and
WHEREAS, a health care provider may conduct several tests,
including an echocardiogram, a cardiac MRI, or genetic testing to
confirm a family history of HCM, and must examine the heart to
diagnose HCM; and
WHEREAS, following a diagnosis of HCM, it is important for
patients to work with their health care provider to learn more about
their disease and understand different management options, including
prescription medications and surgical treatment options that may
help; and
WHEREAS, the fourth Wednesday in February is an appropriate day
to observe Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Awareness Day.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
OF THE 1ST SESSION OF THE 60TH OKLAHOMA LEGISLATURE:
THAT the fourth Wednesday, February 26, 2025, is hereby
recognized by the Oklahoma House of Representatives and the State of
Oklahoma as Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Awareness Day, in order to
raise public awareness about hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
THAT the Oklahoma House of Representatives acknowledges the
critical importance of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy awareness to
improve cardiovascular health in the State of Oklahoma.
THAT the Oklahoma House of Representatives supports raising
awareness of the consequences of undiagnosed and untreated
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and the need to seek appropriate care
for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy as a serious public health issue.
