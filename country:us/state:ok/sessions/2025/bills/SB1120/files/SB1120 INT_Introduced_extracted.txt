GENERAL RULES OF PLEADING
20
21
A. CLAIMS FOR RELIEF. A pleading which sets forth a claim for
21
22
relief, whether an original claim, counterclaim, cross-claim or
22
23
third-party claim, shall contain:
23
24
24
Req. No. 1313 Page 1
1

Section 4:
1. A short and plain statement, made with particularity of all
1
2
material facts known to the pleading party that support the claim
2
3
showing, that creates a reasonable inference that the pleader is
3
4
plausibly entitled to relief. For the purposes of this paragraph, a
4
5
material fact is a fact that is necessary to the claim and without
5
6
which the claim could not be supported. As to facts pleaded on
6
7
belief, the pleading party shall set forth with particularity the
7
8
factual information supporting the pleading party’s belief; and
8
9

Section 5:
2. A demand for judgment for the relief to which he or she
9
10
deems himself or herself entitled. Every pleading demanding relief
10
11
for damages in money in excess of the amount required for diversity
11
12
jurisdiction pursuant to Section 1332 of Title 28 of the United
12
13
States Code shall, without demanding any specific amount of money,
13
14
set forth only that the amount sought as damages is in excess of the
14
15
amount required for diversity jurisdiction pursuant to Section 1332
15
16
of Title 28 of the United States Code, except in actions sounding in
16
17
contract. Every pleading demanding relief for damages in money in
17
18
an amount that is required for diversity jurisdiction pursuant to
18
19

Section 6:
Section 1332 of Title 28 of the United States Code or less shall
19
20
specify the amount of such damages sought to be recovered. Relief
20
21
in the alternative or of several different types may be demanded.
21
22
B. DEFENSES; FORM OF DENIALS. A party shall state in short and
22
23
plain terms his or her defenses to each claim asserted and shall
23
24
admit or deny the averments upon which the adverse party relies. If
24
Req. No. 1313 Page 2
1
he or she is without knowledge or information sufficient to form a
1
2
belief as to the truth of an averment, he or she shall so state and
2
3
this statement has the effect of a denial. Denials shall fairly
3
4
meet the substance of the averments denied. When a pleader intends
4
5
in good faith to deny only a part or a qualification of an averment,
5
6
he or she shall specify so much of it as is true and material and
6
7
shall deny only the remainder. Unless the pleader intends in good
7
8
faith to controvert all the averments of the preceding pleading, he
8
9
or she may make his or her denials as specific denials of designated
9
10
averments or paragraphs or he or she may generally deny all the
10
11
averments except such designated averments or paragraphs as he or
11
12
she expressly admits; but, when he or she does so intend to
12
13
controvert all its averments, he or she may do so by general denial
13
14
subject to the obligations set forth in Section 2011 of this title.
14
15
C. AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES. In pleading to a preceding pleading,

12
13
defense.
13
14
When a party has mistakenly designated a defense as a
14
15
counterclaim or a counterclaim as a defense, the court on terms, if
15
16
justice so requires, shall treat the pleading as if there had been a
16
17
proper designation.
17
18
D. EFFECT OF FAILURE TO DENY. Averments in a pleading to which
18
19
a responsive pleading is required, other than those as to the amount
19
20
of damage, are admitted when not denied in the responsive pleading.
20

Averments in a pleading to which no responsive pleading is required

3
4
statements of a claim or defense alternately or hypothetically,
4
5
either in one count or defense or in separate counts or defenses.
5
6
When two or more statements are made in the alternative and one of
6
7
them if made independently would be sufficient, the pleading is not
7
8
made insufficient by the insufficiency of one or more of the
8
9
alternative statements. A party may also state as many separate
9
10
claims or defenses as he or she has regardless of consistency and
10
11
whether based on legal or equitable grounds. All statements shall
11
12
be made subject to the obligations set forth in Section 2011 of this
12
13
title.
13
14
F. CONSTRUCTION OF PLEADINGS. All pleadings shall be so
14
15
construed as to do substantial justice.

sued in a representative capacity or the legal existence of an
22
23
organized association of persons that is made a party. When a party
23
24
desires to raise an issue as to the legal existence of any party or
24
Req. No. 1313 Page 5
1
the capacity of any party to sue or be sued or the authority of a
1
2

4
supporting particulars as are peculiarly within the pleader’s
4
5
knowledge, and he or she shall have the burden of proof on that
5
6
issue.

B. FRAUD, MISTAKE, CONDITION OF THE MIND. In accordance with
7
8
paragraph 1 of subsection A of Section 2008 of this title, in all

9
averments of fraud or mistake, the circumstances constituting fraud
9
10
or mistake shall be stated with particularity. Malice, intent,
10
11
knowledge, and other condition of mind of a person may be averred
11
12
generally.
12
13
C. CONDITIONS PRECEDENT. In pleading the performance or
13
14
occurrence of conditions precedent, if the pleading otherwise
14
15
satisfies the requirements of paragraph 1 of subsection A of Section
15
16
2008 of this title, it is sufficient to aver generally that all
16
17
conditions precedent have been performed or have occurred. A denial
17
18
of performance or occurrence shall be made specifically and with
18
19
particularity.

D. OFFICIAL DOCUMENT OR ACT. In pleading an official document
20

24
or foreign court, judicial or quasi-judicial tribunal, or of a board
24

1
2
without setting forth matter showing jurisdiction to render it.
2
3

3
4
of a pleading, averments of time and place are material and shall be
4
5
considered like all other averments of material matter.

6
7
their nature shall be specifically stated. In actions where
7
8
exemplary or punitive damages are sought, the petition shall not

9
10
state whether the amount of damages sought to be recovered is in
10
11
excess of or not in excess of the amount required for diversity
11
12
jurisdiction pursuant to Section 1332 of Title 28 of the United
12
13
States Code.
13
14
H. MOTION TO CLARIFY DAMAGES. If the amount of damages sought
14
15
to be recovered by the plaintiff is less than the amount required
15
16
for diversity jurisdiction pursuant to Section 1332 of Title 28 of
16
17
the United States Code, the defendant may file, for purposes of
17
18
establishing diversity jurisdiction only, a Motion to Clarify
18
19
Damages prior to the pretrial order to require the plaintiff to show
19
20
by a preponderance of the evidence that the amount of damages, if
20
21
awarded, will not exceed the amount required for diversity. If the
21
22
court finds that any damages awarded are more likely than not to
22
23
exceed the amount of damages required for diversity jurisdiction,
23
24
the plaintiff shall amend his or her pleadings in conformance with
24
Req. No. 1313 Page 7
