defining terms; requiring the Commission to
9
promulgate rules; establishing provisions for the
9
consideration of electric grid qualifications;
10
prohibiting approval of certain actions by the
10
Commission; providing for certain considerations for
11
the retiring of certain electric generation
11

Section 2:
SECTION 1. NEW LAW A new section of law to be codified
17
18
in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 295 of Title 17, unless there is
18
19
created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:
19
20
A. As used in this section:
20
21

Section 3:
1. “Firming power” means power sources that can provide at
21
22
least forty-eight (48) hours of back-up power to intermittent
22
23
generation at the expected maximum level of power provided by the
23
24
24
Req. No. 59 Page 1
1
intermittent generation, predicted using an industry-standard
1
2
methodology;
2
3

Section 4:
2. “Guaranteed power capacity” means the sum of the on-demand
3
4
power and firming power available, calculated without double-
4
5
counting any power source;
5
6

Section 5:
3. “Intermittent generation” means electric generation that
6
7
requires intermittent sources of energy such as sunlight or wind;
7
8

Section 6:
4. “On-demand power” means electric power from sources that do
8
9
not depend on intermittent sources of energy such as sunlight or
9
10
wind and whose output can be provided within eight (8) hours and
10
11
controlled to meet changes in demand. Provided, on-demand power
11
12
does not include electric power from batteries or other storage
12
13
mechanisms that are charged in whole or in part by intermittent
13
14
generation; and
14
15

Section 7:
5. “Peak net load” means the estimated peak demand minus the
15
16
estimated minimum level of power provided by intermittent generation
16
17
at the time of peak demand, predicted using an industry-standard
17
18
methodology.
18
19
B. The Corporation Commission shall promulgate rules and
19
20
procedures to ensure that any electric grid serving ratepayers in
20
21
this state is affordable and reliable as set forth in this act.
21
22
C. An electric grid shall not be considered affordable and
22
23
reliable unless:
23
24
24
Req. No. 59 Page 2

Section 8:
1. Any new power generation resource is chosen and approved
1
2
based solely on achieving the lowest total monetary cost among
2
3
available options. The lowest total monetary cost shall be
3
4
calculated by adding the total monetary cost of construction and
4
5
operation of such resource that will be charged to ratepayers, the
5
6
fiscal costs to any level of government of direct and indirect
6
7
monetary subsidies applicable to such resource, the monetary cost of
7
8
providing firming power if required by this act or otherwise, and
8
9
other system costs necessary to integrate the resource;
9
10

Section 9:
2. Existing power generation resources are not retired prior to
10
11
the end of their potential useful lives, including where such useful
11
12
lives can be extended through repairs or other modifications, unless
12
13
retirement results in a lower total monetary cost among available
13
14
options and the requirements of subsection E of this section are
14
15
met;
15
16

Section 10:
3. The grid maintains a guaranteed power capacity of at least
16
17
one hundred fifteen percent (115%) of peak net load;
17
18

Section 11:
4. Power generation resources serving the grid meet continuous
18
19
operating requirements for summer and winter peaks, including
19
20
extreme weather events that necessitate on-site fuel storage, dual
20
21
fuel capability, or fuel supply arrangements to ensure performance
21
22
for seven (7) days in the event of extreme weather; and
22
23

Section 12:
5. System-wide loss of load events, such as power shortages or
23
24
brownouts, are not expected to occur, to an industry-standard level
24
Req. No. 59 Page 3
1
of certainty, more than once in ten (10) years, and for a duration
1
2
of five (5) hours or fewer.
2
3
D. The Corporation Commission shall not take any action
3
4
approving a new intermittent generation source unless the source has
4
5
the support of firming power up to the expected maximum output level
5
6
of the source for forty-eight (48) hours during periods of peak load
6
7
on the grid, and the cost of constructing or contracting for that
7
8
firming power shall be included in calculating the total monetary
8
9
cost of the intermittent generation source.
9
10
E. Guaranteed power capacity shall be a primary consideration
10
11
of the Corporation Commission when considering matters related to
11
12
the retiring or adding of electric generation. The Commission shall
12
13
not approve retiring any electric generation source that provides
13
14
on-demand power, including by approving a certificate of convenience
14
15
or a permit to build or acquire intermittent generation, unless the
15
16
utility establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that the
16
17
applicable electric grid will have, at the time of retirement, a
17
18
guaranteed power capacity equal to or greater than described in
18
19
paragraph 3 of subsection C of this section.
19
20
F. The Corporation Commission shall coordinate with regional
20
21
transmission organizations to develop policies which provide power
21
22
for the region in a cost-effective manner that is not weather-
22
23
dependent, can be controlled to meet changes in demand, and meets
23
24
the requirements prescribed by this section.
