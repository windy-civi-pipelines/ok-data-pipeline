1 The Legislature finds that Oklahoma's groundwater resources face
2 critical threats from depletion and contamination due to unqualified
3 workers and improper water access practices. There is a nationwide
4 geoscience workforce shortage projected by the United States
5 Department of Labor to peak at 130,000 workers by 2029, leaving
6 Oklahoma's groundwater industry struggling to fill positions with
7 adequately trained professionals. The growing reliance on untrained
8 workers in the groundwater industry jeopardizes the safety of homes,
9 businesses, and communities and accelerates the degradation of these
10 essential water resources. Immediate action is needed to protect
11 these vital water resources and to equip the groundwater workforce
12 with the skills necessary to ensure sustainable water management
13 practices.
