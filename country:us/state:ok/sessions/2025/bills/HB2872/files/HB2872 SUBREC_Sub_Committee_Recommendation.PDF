2 of the intended turnpike action, afford a comment period for all
3 interested persons to submit data, views, or arguments in writing.
4 The Authority shall consider fully all written submissions regarding
5 the proposed turnpike;
6 3. Within thirty (30) days of the close of the public comment
7 period, schedule a hearing on any proposed turnpike or modification
8 of an existing turnpike. At such hearing, persons may present oral
9 argument, data, and views on the proposed turnpike to the Authority;
10 4. Consider the effect its intended action may have on the
11 various types of property owners, businesses, and governmental
12 entities. Except where such modification or variance is prohibited
13 by statutory or constitutional constraints, if the Authority finds
14 that its actions may adversely affect any such entity, the Authority
15 may modify its proposal. For business entities, the Authority shall
16 include a description of the probable quantitative and qualitative
17 impact of the proposed turnpike, economic or otherwise, and use
18 quantifiable data to the extent possible, considering both short-
19 term and long-term consequences;
20 5. Consider the effect its intended action may have on the
21 various types of consumer groups. If the Authority finds that its
22 actions may adversely affect such groups, the Authority may modify
23 its proposal to exclude the activity that may potentially cause such
24 adverse effects; and
