9 royalty proceeds on such production and all resulting costs or

22 holder of such proceeds shall be relieved of any
23 further liability for the proper payment of such
24 proceeds and interest thereon.
ENGR. H. B. NO. 1371 Page 6
1 c. Where such proceeds are not paid because the physical

3 undeliverable or the physical payment check is never
4 cashed by the royalty owner, such proceeds shall not
5 earn interest after the date the physical payment
6 check was mailed. The payor operator shall maintain

8 amend existing or future contractual rights provided for in gas
9 balancing agreements or other written agreements which expressly
10 provide for the taking, sharing, marketing or balancing of gas or
