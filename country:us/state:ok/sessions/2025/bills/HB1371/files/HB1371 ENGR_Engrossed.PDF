9 royalty proceeds on such production and all resulting costs or

23 further liability for the proper payment of such
24 proceeds and interest thereon.
ENGR. H. B. NO. 1371 Page 6
1 c. Where such proceeds are not paid because the physical

3 undeliverable or the physical payment check is never
4 cashed by the royalty owner, such proceeds shall not
5 earn interest after the date the physical payment
6 check was mailed. The payor operator shall maintain
