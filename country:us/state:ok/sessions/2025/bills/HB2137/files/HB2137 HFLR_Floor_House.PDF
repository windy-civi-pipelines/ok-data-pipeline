1 Section 1175.8. A. If the medical supervisor reports that the

13 office who filed the criminal petition, and the attorney for the
14 person. The prosecuting office or the Department or designee may,

21 indicate:
22 1. If the treating physician of the person believes the person
23 lacks the capacity to make a decision regarding administration of
24 the medication and the reasons for that belief;
HB2137 HFLR Page 2
BOLD FACE denotes Committee Amendments.

11 cause is shown.

16 attorney;

6 1. There exists an important state interest that justifies
7 overriding the lack of consent by the person to the administration
8 of medication;
9 2. Involuntary medication is substantially likely to render the
10 person competent to stand trial and substantially unlikely to have
11 side effects that will interfere significantly with the ability of
12 the person to assist trial counsel;
13 3. Involuntary medication is necessary to further the interests
14 of the state and any alternative, less intrusive treatments are not
15 likely to achieve substantially the same results; and
16 4. The administration of the medication is in the best medical
17 interest of the person in light of the medical condition of the
18 person.
19 G. The court shall make specific findings of fact concerning:
20 1. Each consideration listed under the provisions of subsection
21 F of this section;

2 medication.
3 H. An order for the administration of medications entered
4 following a hearing conducted pursuant to this section shall be

8 involuntary medication. The order shall specify all medications to
9 be potentially involuntarily administered and corresponding dosage
10 ranges.
11 I. Nothing in this section shall be construed to invalidate,
