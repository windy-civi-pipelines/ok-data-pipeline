(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)

1 inco mpetency, the court shall hold another competency hearing to
2 determine if the person has achieved competency. If competency has
3 been achieved, the criminal proceedings shall be resumed.
4 B. If the Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse
5 Services or designee wishes to administer medication, including
6 psychotropic medication, to a person in custody under the provisions
7 of subsection A of Section 1175.6a of this title and has reason to
8 believe the person lacks the capacity to consent to or refuse
9 medication or the person refuses to take the medication voluntarily,
10 the Department or designee shall notify the court, the prosecuting
11 office who filed the criminal petition, and the attorney for the
12 person. The prosecuting office or the Department or designee may,
13 on behalf of the state, file an application for an order authorizing
14 medication for purposes of competency restoration with the court.
15 Any such application shall also seek authorization to continue
16 medication for purposes of maintaining the level of restoration in
17 jail following competency restoration.
18 C. An application seeking authorization of medication shall
19 indicate:
20 1. If the treating physician of the person believes the person
21 lacks the capacity to make a decision regarding administration of
22 the medication and the reasons for that belief;
23
24
SENATE FLOOR VERSION - HB2137 SFLR Page 2
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)

1 2. A summary of the individualized treatment plan of the
2 person, including the specific medications to be potentially
3 administered and the corresponding dosage ranges;
4 3. The diagnosis of the person made by the treating physician;
5 and
6 4. The proposed method for administering the medication and, if
7 the method is not customary, an explanation justifying the departure
8 from the customary method.
9 D. The hearing on the application shall be held no later than
10 thirty (30) days after the filing of the application, unless good
11 cause is shown.
12 E. A person for whom an application for an order to authorize
13 the administration of medication is filed is entitled to:
14 1. An attorney to represent the person at the hearing. If the
15 person cannot afford an attorney, the court shall appoint an
16 attorney;
17 2. Meet with the attorney as soon as is practicable to prepare
18 for the hearing;

(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)

1 6. Request from the court an independent expert; and
2 7. Notification at the conclusion of the hearing of the
3 determination made by the court.
4 F. The administration of medication shall not be ordered unless
5 the petitioning party proves by clear and convincing evidence that:
6 1. There exists an important state interest that justifies
7 overriding the lack of consent by the person to the administration
8 of medication;
9 2. Involuntary medication is substantially likely to render the
10 person competent to stand trial and substantially unlikely to have
11 side effects that will interfere significantly with the ability of
12 the person to assist trial counsel;
13 3. Involuntary medication is necessary to further the interests
14 of the state and any alternative, less intrusive treatments are not
15 likely to achieve substantially the same results; and
16 4. The administration of the medication is in the best medical
17 interest of the person in light of the medical condition of the
18 person.
19 G. The court shall make specific findings of fact concerning:
20 1. Each consideration listed under the provisions of subsection
21 F of this section;
22 2. The desires of the person regarding the proposed treatment;
23 and
24
SENATE FLOOR VERSION - HB2137 SFLR Page 4
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)

1 3. The capacity of the person to consent to or refuse
2 medication.
3 H. An order for the administration of medications entered
4 following a hearing conducted pursuant to this section shall be
5 effective for the period of the current involuntary commitment
6 order, and any interim period during which the person is awaiting
7 trial or a hearing on a new petition for involuntary treatment or
8 involuntary medication. The order shall specify all medications to
9 be potentially involuntarily administered and corresponding dosage
10 ranges.
11 I. Nothing in this section shall be construed to invalidate,
12 prohibit, or alter the administration of medication to a person
13 under other laws or regulations of this state.
14 SECTION 2. This act shall become effective November 1, 2025.
