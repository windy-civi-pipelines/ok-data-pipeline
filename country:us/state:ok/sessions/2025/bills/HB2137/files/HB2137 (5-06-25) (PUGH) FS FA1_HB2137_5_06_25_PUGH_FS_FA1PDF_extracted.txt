10 overriding the lack of consent by the person to the administration

17 of the state and any alternative, less intrusive treatments are not
18 likely to achieve substantially the same results; and

20 interest of the person in light of the medical condition of the
21 person.

9 a hearing on a new petition for involuntary treatment or involuntary
10 medication. The order shall specify all medications to be
11 potentially involuntarily administered and corresponding dosage
