3 B. If the Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse
4 Services or designee wishes to administer medication, including
5 psychotropic medication, to a person in custody under the provisions
6 of subsection A of Section 1175.6a of this title and has reason to
7 believe the person lacks the capacity to consent to or refuse
8 medication or the person refuses to take the medication voluntarily,
9 the Department or designee shall notify the court, the prosecuting
10 office who filed the criminal petition, and the attorney for the
11 person. The prosecuting office or the Department or designee may,
12 on behalf of the state, file an application for an order authorizing
13 medication for purposes of competency restoration with the court.

15 medication for purposes of maintaining the level of restoration in
16 jail following competency restoration.
17 C. An application seeking authorization of medication shall
18 indicate:
19 1. If the treating physician of the person believes the person
20 lacks the capacity to make a decision regarding administration of
21 the medication and the reasons for that belief;
22 2. A summary of the individualized treatment plan of the
23 person, including the specific medications to be potentially
24 administered and the corresponding dosage ranges;
Req. No. 12829 Page 2

1 3. The diagnosis of the person made by the treating physician;
2 and
3 4. The proposed method for administering the medication and, if
4 the method is not customary, an explanation justifying the departure
5 from the customary method.
6 D. The hearing on the application shall be held no later than
7 thirty (30) days after the filing of the application, unless good
8 cause is shown.
9 E. A person for whom an application for an order to authorize
10 the administration of medication is filed is entitled to:
11 1. An attorney to represent the person at the hearing. If the
12 person cannot afford an attorney, the court shall appoint an
13 attorney;
14 2. Meet with the attorney as soon as is practicable to prepare

Req. No. 12829 Page 3

1 F. The administration of medication shall not be ordered unless
2 the petitioning party proves by clear and convincing evidence that:
3 1. There exists an important state interest that justifies
4 overriding the lack of consent by the person to the administration
5 of medication;
6 2. Involuntary medication is substantially likely to render the
7 person competent to stand trial and substantially unlikely to have
8 side effects that will interfere significantly with the ability of
9 the person to assist trial counsel;
10 3. Involuntary medication is necessary to further the interests
11 of the state and any alternative, less intrusive treatments are not
12 likely to achieve substantially the same results; and
13 4. The administration of the medication is in the best medical
14 interest of the person in light of the medical condition of the
15 person.
16 G. The court shall make specific findings of fact concerning:
17 1. Each consideration listed under the provisions of subsection
18 F of this section;
19 2. The desires of the person regarding the proposed treatment;
20 and
21 3. The capacity of the person to consent to or refuse
22 medication.
23 H. An order for the administration of medications entered
24 following a hearing conducted pursuant to this section shall be
Req. No. 12829 Page 4

1 effe ctive for the period of the current involuntary commitment
2 order, and any interim period during which the person is awaiting
3 trial or a hearing on a new petition for involuntary treatment or
4 involuntary medication. The order shall specify all medications to
5 be potentially involuntarily administered and corresponding dosage
6 ranges.
7 I. Nothing in this section shall be construed to invalidate,
8 prohibit, or alter the administration of medication to a person
9 under other laws or regulations of this state.
10 SECTION 2. This act shall become effective November 1, 2025.
