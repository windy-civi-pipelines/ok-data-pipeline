Section 2:
SECTION 1. NEW LAW A new section of law not to be
15
16
codified in the Oklahoma Statutes reads as follows:
16
17
A. This act shall be known and may be cited as the “Oklahoma
17
18

20

Section 3:
1. During the years 2020 through 2022, federal government
20
21
agencies collaborated with medical organizations, media
21
22
personalities, social media platforms, and other influential
22
23
entities to orchestrate a coordinated and coercive propaganda
23
24
campaign. This campaign was characterized by psychological pressure
24
Req. No. 1436 Page 1

and public shaming directed at individuals who declined COVID-19
1
2
vaccinations, coupled with the aggressive suppression of dissenting
2
3
views, including those expressed by esteemed medical and scientific
3
4
professionals with extensive credentials;
4
5

Section 4:
2. This coordinated effort created an environment conducive to
5
6
the implementation of unconstitutional and unethical medical
6
7
mandates at federal, state, and local levels. These mandates
7
8
disregarded individual autonomy and the principles of informed
8
9
consent and due process, which are cornerstones of ethical medical
9
10
practice;
10
11

Section 5:
3. As a result of these mandates, thousands of Americans in the
11
12
public and private sectors, including Oklahoma citizens, were
12
13
unjustly terminated from their employment and/or lost retirement
13
14
benefits for exercising their right to medical freedom. Many others
14
15
were denied access to essential public accommodations, violating
15
16
their constitutional rights and creating severe social and economic
16
17
repercussions;
17
18

Section 6:
4. Emerging peer-reviewed studies and post-marketing
18
19
surveillance data have revealed that COVID-19 vaccinations, contrary
19
20
to the assertions of the propaganda campaign:
20
21
a. provided a substantially lower level of protection
21
22
against contracting and transmitting COVID-19 than
22
23
initially claimed, undermining the justification for
23
24
their widespread and mandatory administration, and
24
Req. No. 1436 Page 2
1
b. were associated with increased risks to heart health,
1
2
including myocarditis and pericarditis, particularly
2
3
in younger populations, as well as potential adverse
3
4
effects on fertility, raising significant public
4
5
health concerns; and
5
6

Section 7:
5. The State of Oklahoma bears a profound ethical and
6
7
constitutional obligation to safeguard its citizens from any future
7
8
recurrence of coercive medical mandates or campaigns that compromise
8
9
the principles of bodily autonomy, medical ethics, and public trust
9
10
in health care.
10
11

Section 8:

14
A. The right of a person to refuse any medical procedure,
14
15

16
questioned or interfered with in any manner. The right of a person
16
17
to public accommodation, to the equal protection of the law, and to

18
19
because of the exercise of the rights contained in this section.
19
20
B. Health care professionals, including physicians, nurses, and
20
21
allied health providers, shall be protected from any disciplinary
21
22
action, loss of licensure, or professional penalties for:
22
23

Section 9:
1. Voicing concerns or dissent regarding medical mandates,
23
24
treatments, or protocols;
24
Req. No. 1436 Page 3
1

Section 10:
2. Advocating for patients’ rights to informed consent, medical

3
4
mandates, or improper actions by health care institutions or
4
5
governing bodies.
5
6
C. State medical licensing boards, professional oversight
6
7
organizations, or any other regulatory authority shall not:
7
8

12
13
recommendations or practices.
13
14
D. A cause of action is hereby created for any health care
14
15
professional who experiences retaliation, intimidation, or

professional harm as a result of engaging in protected activities
16
17
under this act. Such individuals may seek:

23
professional that is alleged to violate this section shall be
23
24
subject to expedited judicial review. The burden of proof shall
24
Req. No. 1436 Page 4
