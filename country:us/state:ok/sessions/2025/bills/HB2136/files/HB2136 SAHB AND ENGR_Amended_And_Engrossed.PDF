10 B. The provisions of this section shall only be applicable to a
11 member of the Oklahoma National Guard who has accrued enough service

13 from the system maintained by the Defense Finance and Accounting
14 Service, or its successor in interest, for the benefit of members of

ENGR. H. B. NO. 2136 Page 2

1 1. Determine the amount of retirement the member would receive
2 if the member had reached the age to accrue federal retirement
3 benefits;
4 2. If the members of the active duty military retirement system
5 were eligible for a cost-of-living adjustment for the year for which
6 the computation of the payment amount authorized by this section is
7 to be made, the cost-of-living adjustment amount in an annualized
8 form shall be added to the result of the computation in paragraph 1
9 of this subsection each year; and
10 3. The resulting amount shall be paid to the Oklahoma National
11 Guard member in twelve equal monthly amounts with allowance as
12 required for rounding.
13 E. Any benefit payable to an eligible member of the Oklahoma
14 National Guard shall only be payable during the member's lifetime,
15 and no benefit authorized pursuant to the provisions of this section
16 shall be payable to a beneficiary other than amounts paid to a
17 member prior to the member's death which are payable to another
18 person pursuant to the provisions of a joint tenancy bank account
19 with a right of survivorship naming a person or persons as
20 beneficiary, a bank account with a transfer on death or payable on
21 death feature, an express trust, including, but not limited to, a

4 of this act may only be made to a person who has become eligible to

6 supervision of the Defense Finance and Accounting Service, or its
7 successor in interest, as of the date the first payment pursuant to
8 this act is authorized.
9 G. The payments authorized by this section shall be paid to the
10 eligible member until the member begins to receive federal
11 retirement benefits from the Defense Finance and Accounting Service,
12 or its successor in interest, but shall not be paid for any period
13 of time after such time period.
14 H. In the event the funds required for full payment to all
15 eligible members pursuant to the provisions of this section are not
16 sufficient, the payments to the eligible members shall be prorated
17 by dividing the total number of eligible members by the total amount
18 of available funds. The resulting quotient shall be multiplied by
19 the payment amount otherwise due to the eligible member and the
20 result of that computation shall be the reduced dollar amount paid
21 to each member for the applicable period. For any period of time
22 during which payments are prorated pursuant to this subsection, the
23 next increment of available funds shall be used to make payments to
24
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2136 Page 4
