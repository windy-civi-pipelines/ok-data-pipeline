5. The net income or loss remaining after the separate
12
13
allocation in paragraph 4 of this subsection, being that which is
13
14
derived from a unitary business enterprise, shall be apportioned to
14
15
this state on the basis of the arithmetical average of three factors
15
16
consisting of property, payroll and sales or gross revenue
16
17
enumerated as subparagraphs a, b and c of this paragraph. Net

other property used in the unitary enterprise. Deductions used in
23
24
computing such net income or loss shall not include taxes based on

equaling or exceeding Two Hundred Million Dollars ($200,000,000.00)
7
8
over a period not to exceed three (3) years, and such expansion is
8
9
commenced on or after January 1, 2000, the three factors shall be
9
10
apportioned with property and payroll, each comprising twenty-five
10
11
percent (25%) of the apportionment factor and sales comprising fifty
11
12
percent (50%) of the apportionment factor. The apportionment
12
13
factors shall be computed as follows:
13
14
a. The property factor is a fraction, the numerator of
14
15
which is the average value of the taxpayer’s real and
15
16
tangible personal property owned or rented and used in
16
17
this state during the tax period and the denominator
17
18
of which is the average value of all the taxpayer’s
18
19
real and tangible personal property everywhere owned
19
20
or rented and used during the tax period.
20
21
(1) Property, the income from which is separately
21
22
allocated in paragraph 4 of this subsection,
22
23
shall not be included in determining this
23
24
fraction. The numerator of the fraction shall
24
Req. No. 933 Page 21

1
include a portion of the investment in
1
2
transportation and other equipment having no
2
3
fixed situs, such as rolling stock, buses, trucks
3
4
and trailers, including machinery and equipment
4
5
carried thereon, airplanes, salespersons’
5
6
automobiles and other similar equipment, in the
6
7
proportion that miles traveled in Oklahoma this
7
8
state by such equipment bears to total miles
8
9
traveled,
9
10
(2) Property owned by the taxpayer is valued at its
10
11
original cost. Property rented by the taxpayer
11
12
is valued at eight times the net annual rental
12
13
rate. Net annual rental rate is the annual
13
14
rental rate paid by the taxpayer, less any annual
14
15
rental rate received by the taxpayer from
15
16
subrentals,
16
17
(3) The average value of property shall be determined
17
18
by averaging the values at the beginning and
18
19
ending of the tax period but the Oklahoma Tax
19
20
Commission may require the averaging of monthly
20
21
values during the tax period if reasonably
21
22
required to reflect properly the average value of
22
23
the taxpayer’s property;
23
24
24
Req. No. 933 Page 22

b. The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of
1
2
which is the total compensation for services rendered
2
3
in the state during the tax period, and the
3
4
denominator of which is the total compensation for
4
5
services rendered everywhere during the tax period.
5
6
“Compensation”, as used in this subsection, means
6
7
those paid-for services to the extent related to the
7
8
unitary business but does not include officers’
8
9
salaries, wages and other compensation.
9
10
(1) In the case of a transportation enterprise, the
10
11
numerator of the fraction shall include a portion
11
12
of such expenditure in connection with employees
12
13
operating equipment over a fixed route, such as
13
14
railroad employees, airline pilots, or bus
14
15
drivers, in this state only a part of the time,
15
16
in the proportion that mileage traveled in
16
17
Oklahoma this state bears to total mileage
17
18
traveled by such employees,
18
19
(2) In any case the numerator of the fraction shall
19
20
include a portion of such expenditures in
20
21
connection with itinerant employees, such as
21
22
traveling salespersons, in this state only a part
22
23
of the time, in the proportion that time spent in
23
24
24
Req. No. 933 Page 23

1
Oklahoma this state bears to total time spent in
1
2
furtherance of the enterprise by such employees;
2
3
c. The sales factor is a fraction, the numerator of which
3
4
is the total sales or gross revenue of the taxpayer in
4
5
this state during the tax period, and the denominator
5
6
of which is the total sales or gross revenue of the
6
7
taxpayer everywhere during the tax period. “Sales”,
7
8
as used in this subsection, does not include sales or
8
9
gross revenue which are separately allocated in
9
10
paragraph 4 of this subsection.
10
11
(1) Sales of tangible personal property have a situs
11
12
in this state if the property is delivered or
12
13
shipped to a purchaser other than the United
13
14
States government, within this state regardless
14
15
of the FOB Freight on Board (FOB) point or other
15
16
conditions of the sale; or the property is
16
17
shipped from an office, store, warehouse, factory
17
18
or other place of storage in this state and (a)
18
19
the purchaser is the United States government or
19
20
(b) the taxpayer is not doing business in the
20
21
state of the destination of the shipment.
21
22
(2) In the case of a railroad or interurban railway
22
23
enterprise, the numerator of the fraction shall
23
24
not be less than the allocation of revenues to
24
Req. No. 933 Page 24

1
this state as shown in its annual report to the
1
2
Corporation Commission.

4
5
car or other railroad equipment enterprise, the
5
6
numerator of the fraction shall include a portion
6
7
of revenue from interstate transportation in the
7
8
proportion that interstate mileage traveled in
8
9
Oklahoma this state bears to total interstate
9
10
mileage traveled.
10
11
(4) In the case of an oil, gasoline or gas pipeline
11
12
enterprise, the numerator of the fraction shall
12
13
be either the total of traffic units of the
13
14
enterprise within Oklahoma this state or the
14
15
revenue allocated to Oklahoma this state based
15
16
upon miles moved, at the option of the taxpayer,
16
17
and the denominator of which shall be the total
17
18
of traffic units of the enterprise or the revenue
18
19
of the enterprise everywhere as appropriate to
19
20
the numerator. A “traffic unit” is hereby
20
21
defined as the transportation for a distance of
21
22
one (1) mile of one (1) barrel of oil, one (1)

(5) In the case of a telephone or telegraph or other
3
4
communication enterprise, the numerator of the
4
5
fraction shall include that portion of the
5
6
interstate revenue as is allocated pursuant to
6
7
the accounting procedures prescribed by the
7
8
Federal Communications Commission; provided that
8
9
in respect to each corporation or business entity
9
10
required by the Federal Communications Commission
10
11
to keep its books and records in accordance with
11
12
a uniform system of accounts prescribed by such
12
13
Commission, the intrastate net income shall be
13
14
determined separately in the manner provided by
14
15
such uniform system of accounts and only the
15
16
interstate income shall be subject to allocation
16
17
pursuant to the provisions of this subsection.
17
18
Provided further, that the gross revenue factors
18
19
shall be those as are determined pursuant to the
19
20
accounting procedures prescribed by the Federal
20
21
Communications Commission.
21
22
In any case where the apportionment of the three factors
22
23
prescribed in this paragraph attributes to Oklahoma this state a
23
24
portion of net income of the enterprise out of all appropriate
24
Req. No. 933 Page 26

1
proportion to the property owned and/or business transacted within
1
2
this state, because of the fact that one or more of the factors so
2
3
prescribed are not employed to any appreciable extent in furtherance
3
4
of the enterprise; or because one or more factors not so prescribed
4
5
are employed to a considerable extent in furtherance of the
5
6
enterprise; or because of other reasons, the Tax Commission is
6
7
empowered to permit, after a showing by taxpayer that an excessive
7
8
portion of net income has been attributed to Oklahoma this state, or
8
9
require, when in its judgment an insufficient portion of net income
9
10
has been attributed to Oklahoma this state, the elimination,
10
11
substitution, or use of additional factors, or reduction or increase
11
12
in the weight of such prescribed factors. Provided, however, that
12
13
any such variance from such prescribed factors which has the effect
13
14
of increasing the portion of net income attributable to Oklahoma
14
15
this state must not be inherently arbitrary, and application of the
15
16
recomputed final apportionment to the net income of the enterprise
16
17
must attribute to Oklahoma this state only a reasonable portion
17
18
thereof.

6. For calendar years 1997 and 1998, the owner of a new or
19

4
the exemption shall be adjusted annually so that the total estimated
4
5
reduction in tax liability does not exceed One Million Dollars
5
6
($1,000,000.00) annually. The Tax Commission shall promulgate rules
6
7
for determining the percentage of the investment which each eligible
7
8
taxpayer may exclude. The exclusion provided by this paragraph
8
9
shall be taken in the taxable year when the investment is made. In
9
10
the event the total reduction in tax liability authorized by this
10
11
paragraph exceeds One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) in any
11
12
calendar year, the Tax Commission shall permit any excess over One
12
13
Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) and shall factor such excess into
13
14
the percentage for subsequent years. Any amount of the exemption
14
15
permitted to be excluded pursuant to the provisions of this
15
16
paragraph but not used in any year may be carried forward as an
16
17
exemption from income pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph
17
18
for a period not exceeding six (6) years following the year in which
18
19
the investment was originally made.
