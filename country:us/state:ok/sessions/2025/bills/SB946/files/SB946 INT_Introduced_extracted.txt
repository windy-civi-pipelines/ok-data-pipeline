4
5
which would be a felony if committed by an adult, the court on its
5
6
own motion or at the request of the district attorney shall conduct
6
7
a preliminary hearing to determine whether or not there is
7
8
prosecutive merit to the complaint. If the court finds that
8
9
prosecutive merit exists, it shall continue the hearing for a
9
10
sufficient period of time to conduct an investigation and further
10
11
hearing to determine if the child should be held accountable for

12
acts of the child as if the child were an adult if the child should
12
13
be found to have committed the alleged act or omission.
13
14
Consideration shall be given to:
14
15

Section 6:
1. The seriousness of the alleged offense to the community, and
15
16
whether the alleged offense was committed in an aggressive, violent,
16
17
premeditated or willful manner;
17
18

Section 7:
2. Whether the offense was against persons or property, greater
18
19
weight being given to transferring the accused person to the adult
19
20
criminal justice system for offenses against persons and, if
20
21
personal injury resulted, the degree of personal injury;
21
22

Section 8:
3. The sophistication and maturity of the juvenile and
22
23
capability of the juvenile of distinguishing right from wrong as
23
24
determined by consideration of a psychological evaluation of the
24
Req. No. 665 Page 2
1
juvenile, home, environmental situation, emotional attitude and
1
2
pattern of living;
2
3

Section 9:

7
juvenile institutions;

12
juvenile court; and

13

Section 12:
7. Whether the offense occurred while the juvenile was escaping
13
14
or in an escape status from an institution for delinquent children.
14
15
After the investigation and hearing, the court may in its
15
16
discretion proceed with the juvenile proceeding, or it shall state
16
17
its reasons in writing and shall certify, based on clear and
17
18
convincing evidence, that the child shall be held accountable for
18
19
acts of the child as if the child were an adult and shall be held
19
20
for proper criminal proceedings for the specific offense charged, by
20
21
any other division of the court which would have trial jurisdiction
21
22
of the offense if committed by an adult. The juvenile proceeding
22
23
shall not be dismissed until the criminal proceeding has commenced
23
24
and if no criminal proceeding commences within thirty (30) days of
24
Req. No. 665 Page 3

summons at the commencement of a juvenile proceeding, but

11
B. Prior to the entry of any order of certification, any child

in custody shall have the same right to be released upon bail as
12
13
would an adult under the same circumstances. Subsequent to the
13
14
entry of an order that a child stand trial as an adult, the child
14
15
shall have all the statutory and constitutional rights and
15
16
protections of an adult accused of a crime. Upon conviction, the
16
17
juvenile may be incarcerated in an adult jail, adult lockup, adult
17
18
detention facility or other adult facility if that facility is
18
19

19
20
eighteen (18) years of age in compliance with Sections 2-3-101 and

If, prior to the entry of any order of certification, the child
3
4
becomes eighteen (18) years of age, the child may be detained in a
4
5
county jail or released on bail. If a child is certified to stand
5
6
trial as an adult, the court shall make every effort to avoid
6
7
duplication of the adult preliminary hearing and the prosecutorial
7
8
hearing in the juvenile certification process. The parties may
8
9
jointly stipulate to the court that the record for the prosecutorial
9
10
merit hearing in the juvenile proceeding be used for all or part of
10
11
the preliminary hearing.

of the juvenile court or be eligible to be tried as a youthful
16

offender in any further proceedings.

18
19

constitute a felony if committed by an adult and it
10

12
the child requires detention. The detention of any

hearing on such application, the court, for good and
16

6
7
a preliminary hearing to determine whether or not there is
7
8
prosecutive merit to the complaint. If the court finds that
8
9
prosecutive merit exists, it shall continue the hearing for a
9
10
sufficient period of time to conduct an investigation and further
10
11
hearing to determine if the child should be held accountable for
11
12
acts of the child as if the child were an adult if the child should
12
13
be found to have committed the alleged act or omission.
13
14
Consideration shall be given to:
14
15
1. The seriousness of the alleged offense to the community, and
15
16
whether the alleged offense was committed in an aggressive, violent,
16
17
premeditated or willful manner;
17
18
2. Whether the offense was against persons or property, greater
18
19
weight being given to transferring the accused person to the adult
19
20
criminal justice system for offenses against persons and, if
20
21
personal injury resulted, the degree of personal injury;
21
22
3. The sophistication and maturity of the juvenile and
22
23
capability of the juvenile of distinguishing right from wrong as
23
24
determined by consideration of a psychological evaluation of the
24
Req. No. 665 Page 2

1
juvenile, home, environmental situation, emotional attitude and
1
2
pattern of living;
2
3
4. The record and previous history of the accused person,
3
4
including previous contacts with community agencies, law enforcement
4
5
agencies, schools, juvenile or criminal courts and other
5
6
jurisdictions, prior periods of probation or prior commitments to
6
7
juvenile institutions;
7
8
5. The prospects for adequate protection of the public;
8
9
6. The likelihood of reasonable rehabilitation of the juvenile
9
10
if the juvenile is found to have committed the alleged offense, by
10
11
the use of procedures and facilities currently available to the
11
12
juvenile court; and
12
13
7. Whether the offense occurred while the juvenile was escaping
13
14
or in an escape status from an institution for delinquent children.
14
15
After the investigation and hearing, the court may in its
15
16
discretion proceed with the juvenile proceeding, or it shall state
16
17
its reasons in writing and shall certify, based on clear and
17
18
convincing evidence, that the child shall be held accountable for
18
19
acts of the child as if the child were an adult and shall be held
19
20
for proper criminal proceedings for the specific offense charged, by
20
21
any other division of the court which would have trial jurisdiction
21
22
of the offense if committed by an adult. The juvenile proceeding
22
23
shall not be dismissed until the criminal proceeding has commenced
23
24
and if no criminal proceeding commences within thirty (30) days of
24
Req. No. 665 Page 3

the date of the certification, unless stayed pending appeal, the
1
2
court shall proceed with the juvenile proceeding and the

consider whether a child should be certified for trial as an adult
5
6
shall be given to all persons who are required to be served with a
6
7
summons at the commencement of a juvenile proceeding, but

is not required. The purpose of the hearing shall be clearly stated
9
10
in the notice.
10
11
B. Prior to the entry of any order of certification, any child
11
12
in custody shall have the same right to be released upon bail as
12
13
would an adult under the same circumstances. Subsequent to the
13
14
entry of an order that a child stand trial as an adult, the child
14
15
shall have all the statutory and constitutional rights and
15
16
protections of an adult accused of a crime. Upon conviction, the
16
17
juvenile may be incarcerated in an adult jail, adult lockup, adult
17
18
detention facility or other adult facility if that facility is
18
19
licensed by the State Department of Health to detain children under
19
20
eighteen (18) years of age in compliance with Sections 2-3-101 and

24
provisions of Section 192 of Title 74 of the Oklahoma Statutes,
24
Req. No. 665 Page 4

shall notify the State Department of Health within twenty-four (24)
1
2
hours of holding or detaining a person pursuant to this section.
2
3
If, prior to the entry of any order of certification, the child
3
4
becomes eighteen (18) years of age, the child may be detained in a
4
5
county jail or released on bail. If a child is certified to stand
5
6
trial as an adult, the court shall make every effort to avoid
6
7
duplication of the adult preliminary hearing and the prosecutorial
7
8
hearing in the juvenile certification process. The parties may
8
9
jointly stipulate to the court that the record for the prosecutorial
9
10
merit hearing in the juvenile proceeding be used for all or part of
10
11
the preliminary hearing.
11
12
C. Any child who has been certified to stand trial as an adult
12
13
pursuant to any order entered by any competent court of this state
13
14
or any other state shall be tried as an adult in all subsequent
14
15
criminal prosecutions, and shall not be subject to the jurisdiction
15
16
of the juvenile court or be eligible to be tried as a youthful
16
17
offender in any further proceedings.
17
18
D. An order either certifying a person as a child or an adult
18
19
pursuant to subsection A of this section or denying such
19
20
certification shall be a final order, appealable when entered and
20
21
shall not be modified.

4
5
public.
5
6
1. a. No child twelve (12) years of age or younger shall be
6
7
placed in a juvenile detention facility unless all
7
8
alternatives have been exhausted and the child is
8
9
currently charged with a criminal offense that would
9
10
constitute a felony if committed by an adult and it
10
11
has been indicated by a risk-assessment screening that
11
12
the child requires detention. The detention of any
12
13
child twelve (12) years of age or younger shall be
13
14
judicially reviewed pursuant to subparagraph c of this
14
15
paragraph.

19
20
criminal offense that would constitute a felony if
20
21

3
4
sufficient cause shown, may extend the effective
4
5
period of such an order for an additional period not
5
6
to exceed sixty (60) days. If the child is being
6
7
detained for the commission of a murder, the court
7
8

8
9
the effective period of such an order an additional

11
12
juvenile detention facility, an order for secure

hearing on such application, the court, for good and
16

sufficient cause shown, may extend the effective

6
telephone device that allows all parties, including
6
7
the child, to hear and be heard by the other parties
7
8
at the hearing. After the hearing, the court may
8
9
order continued detention in a juvenile detention
