17 SECTION 3. AMENDATORY 10A O.S. 2021, Section 1-4-811, is
18 amended to read as follows:
19 Section 1-4-811. A. 1. The court shall conduct a permanency

24 placement and every six (6) months thereafter, and
Req. No. 10851 Page 11
1 b. thirty (30) days after a determination by the court
2 that reasonable efforts to return a child to either
3 parent are not required pursuant to the provisions of
4 Section 1-4-809 of this title.
5 2. A child shall be considered to have entered out-of-home
6 placement on the earlier of:
7 a. the adjudication date, or
8 b. the date that is sixty (60) days after the date on
9 which the child is removed from the home.
10 3. Subsequent permanency hearings shall be held at least every
11 six (6) months for any child who continues to be in an out-of-home
12 placement. At the request of a party, the Department of Human
13 Services, or on the motion of the court, the initial and subsequent
14 permanency hearings may be held more frequently. If the child's
15 permanency goal is adoption, the court shall hold a permanency
16 hearing within thirty (30) days of a scheduled trial to terminate
17 parental rights, if a party requests such hearing, to determine
18 whether adoption is still the appropriate permanency goal.
19 4. At each permanency hearing, the court may consider testimony
20 of any person who has relevant information about the status of the
21 child or the status of the treatment plan. All parties shall have
22 the opportunity to present evidence and to cross-examine witnesses.
23 The rules of evidence shall not apply to permanency hearings and all
24 evidence helpful in determining the proper permanency goal shall be
Req. No. 10851 Page 12
1 cons idered including, but not limited to, oral and written reports,
2 which may be admitted and may be relied upon to the extent of their
3 probative value, even though not competent for the purposes of the
4 adjudicatory hearing.
5 5. The permanency plan for the child in transition to a
6 successful adulthood shall be developed in consultation with the
7 child and, at the option of the child, with up to two members of the
8 permanency planning team to be chosen by the child, excluding the
9 foster parent and caseworker for the child, subject to the following
10 provisions:
11 a. one individual selected by the child may be designated
12 to be the advisor and, as necessary, advocate of the
13 child, with respect to the application of the
14 reasonable and prudent parent standard to the child,
15 and
16 b. the Department of Human Services may reject an
17 individual selected by the child to be a member of the
18 permanency planning team at any time if the Department
19 has good cause to believe that the selected individual
20 would not act in the best interests of the child.
21 B. A permanency hearing may be held concurrently with a
22 dispositional or review hearing.
23 C. If a foster parent, preadoptive parent, or relative is
24 currently providing care for a child, the Department shall give the
Req. No. 10851 Page 13
1 fost er parent, preadoptive parent, or relative notice of a
2 proceeding concerning the child. A foster parent, preadoptive
3 parent, or relative providing care for a child has the right to be
4 heard at the proceeding. Except when allowed to intervene, the
5 foster parent, preadoptive parent, or relative providing care for
6 the child is not considered a party to the juvenile court proceeding
7 solely because of notice and the right to be heard at the
8 proceeding.
9 D. At the hearing, the court shall determine or review the
10 continued appropriateness of the permanency plan of the child and
11 whether a change in the plan is necessary, the date by which the
12 goal of permanency for the child is scheduled to be achieved, and
13 whether the current placement of the child continues to be the most
14 suitable for the health, safety, and welfare of the child. The
15 court shall also, in an age-appropriate manner, inquire or cause
16 inquiry to be made of the child regarding the proposed permanency
17 plan and if the child is age fourteen (14) or older, the planning
18 for the transition of the child to a successful adulthood.
19 E. A transcript shall be made of each permanency hearing or the
20 proceeding shall be memorialized by appropriate written findings of
21 facts, and the court having considered all relevant information
22 shall order one of the following permanency plans for the child:
23 1. Reunification with the parent, parents, or legal guardian of
24 the child where:
Req. No. 10851 Page 14
1 a. reunification can be expected to occur within an
2 established time frame that is consistent with the
3 developmental needs of the child, and
4 b. the health and safety of the child can be adequately
5 safeguarded if returned home;
6 2. Placement for adoption after the rights of the parents have
7 been terminated or after a petition has been filed to terminate
8 parental rights;
9 3. Placement with a person who will be the permanent guardian
10 of the child and is able to adequately and appropriately safeguard
11 the health, safety, and welfare of the child; or
12 4. a. Placement in the legal custody of the Department under
13 a planned alternative permanent placement, provided
14 the child is age sixteen (16) or older and there are
15 compelling reasons documented by the Department and
16 presented to the court at each permanency hearing that
17 include the intensive, ongoing and, as of the date of
18 the hearing, unsuccessful efforts made to:
19 (1) return the child home, or
20 (2) place the child with a fit and willing relative,

2 utilizing search technology, including social
3 media.
4 b. The Department shall also document at each permanency
5 hearing the steps taken, including inquiry of the
6 child in an age-appropriate manner, to ensure that:
7 (1) the foster family home of the child or facility
8 where the child is placed is following the
9 reasonable and prudent parent standard, and
10 (2) the child has regular, ongoing opportunities to
11 engage in age-appropriate or developmentally
12 appropriate activities.
13 c. When a planned alternative permanent placement is the
14 court-ordered permanency plan for the child, the court
15 shall at each permanency hearing:
16 (1) ask the child about the permanency outcome the
17 child desires, and
18 (2) make a judicial determination, as of the date of
19 the hearing, why a planned alternative permanent
20 placement is the best permanency plan for the
21 child and provide compelling reasons why it
22 continues to not be in the best interests of the
23 child to return home or be placed for adoption
24 with a legal guardian or with a fit and willing
Req. No. 10851 Page 16
1 relative, taking into consideration whether the
2 child has a close and positive relationship with
3 the parent.
4 F. In addition to the findings required under subsection E of
5 this section, the court shall also make written findings related to:
6 1. Whether the Department has made reasonable efforts to
7 finalize the permanency plan that is in effect for the child and a
8 summary of the efforts the Department has made; or, in the case of
9 an Indian child, whether the Department has made active efforts to
10 provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs as required by
11 25 U.S.C., Section 1912(d);
12 2. If the permanency plan is for the child to remain in out-of-
13 home care, whether the child's out-of-home placement continues to be
14 appropriate and in the best interests of the child;
15 3. If the current placement is not expected to be permanent,
16 the court's projected timetable for return home or for placement in
17 an adoptive home with a guardian, or another planned permanent
18 living arrangement; and
19 4. Whether reasonable efforts, in accordance with the safety or
20 well-being of any child, have been made to:
21 a. place siblings, who have been removed, together in the
22 same foster care, guardianship, or adoptive placement,
23 and
24
Req. No. 10851 Page 17
1 b. provide for frequent visitation or other ongoing
2 interaction in the case of siblings who have been
3 removed and who are not placed together.
4 G. The court may make appropriate orders to ensure timely
5 implementation of the permanency plan and shall order the plan to be
6 accomplished within a specified period of time.

23 a. six (6) months after placing the child in out-of-home
24 placement and every six (6) months thereafter, and
Req. No. 10851 Page 11

1 b. thirty (30) days after a determination by the court
2 that reasonable efforts to return a child to either
3 parent are not required pursuant to the provisions of
4 Section 1-4-809 of this title.
5 2. A child shall be considered to have entered out-of-home
6 placement on the earlier of:
7 a. the adjudication date, or
8 b. the date that is sixty (60) days after the date on
9 which the child is removed from the home.
10 3. Subsequent permanency hearings shall be held at least every
11 six (6) months for any child who continues to be in an out-of-home
12 placement. At the request of a party, the Department of Human
13 Services, or on the motion of the court, the initial and subsequent
14 permanency hearings may be held more frequently. If the child's
15 permanency goal is adoption, the court shall hold a permanency
16 hearing within thirty (30) days of a scheduled trial to terminate
17 parental rights, if a party requests such hearing, to determine
18 whether adoption is still the appropriate permanency goal.
19 4. At each permanency hearing, the court may consider testimony
20 of any person who has relevant information about the status of the
21 child or the status of the treatment plan. All parties shall have
22 the opportunity to present evidence and to cross-examine witnesses.
23 The rules of evidence shall not apply to permanency hearings and all
24 evidence helpful in determining the proper permanency goal shall be
Req. No. 10851 Page 12

1 cons idered including, but not limited to, oral and written reports,
2 which may be admitted and may be relied upon to the extent of their
3 probative value, even though not competent for the purposes of the
4 adjudicatory hearing.
5 5. The permanency plan for the child in transition to a
6 successful adulthood shall be developed in consultation with the
7 child and, at the option of the child, with up to two members of the
8 permanency planning team to be chosen by the child, excluding the
9 foster parent and caseworker for the child, subject to the following
10 provisions:
11 a. one individual selected by the child may be designated
12 to be the advisor and, as necessary, advocate of the
13 child, with respect to the application of the
14 reasonable and prudent parent standard to the child,
15 and

21 B. A permanency hearing may be held concurrently with a
22 dispositional or review hearing.
23 C. If a foster parent, preadoptive parent, or relative is
24 currently providing care for a child, the Department shall give the
Req. No. 10851 Page 13

1 fost er parent, preadoptive parent, or relative notice of a
2 proceeding concerning the child. A foster parent, preadoptive
3 parent, or relative providing care for a child has the right to be
4 heard at the proceeding. Except when allowed to intervene, the
5 foster parent, preadoptive parent, or relative providing care for
6 the child is not considered a party to the juvenile court proceeding
7 solely because of notice and the right to be heard at the
8 proceeding.
9 D. At the hearing, the court shall determine or review the
10 continued appropriateness of the permanency plan of the child and
11 whether a change in the plan is necessary, the date by which the
12 goal of permanency for the child is scheduled to be achieved, and
13 whether the current placement of the child continues to be the most
14 suitable for the health, safety, and welfare of the child. The
15 court shall also, in an age-appropriate manner, inquire or cause
16 inquiry to be made of the child regarding the proposed permanency
17 plan and if the child is age fourteen (14) or older, the planning
18 for the transition of the child to a successful adulthood.
19 E. A transcript shall be made of each permanency hearing or the
20 proceeding shall be memorialized by appropriate written findings of
21 facts, and the court having considered all relevant information
22 shall order one of the following permanency plans for the child:
23 1. Reunification with the parent, parents, or legal guardian of
24 the child where:
Req. No. 10851 Page 14

11 the health, safety, and welfare of the child; or
12 4. a. Placement in the legal custody of the Department under
13 a planned alternative permanent placement, provided
14 the child is age sixteen (16) or older and there are

2 utilizing search technology, including social
3 media.
4 b. The Department shall also document at each permanency
5 hearing the steps taken, including inquiry of the
6 child in an age-appropriate manner, to ensure that:
7 (1) the foster family home of the child or facility
8 where the child is placed is following the
9 reasonable and prudent parent standard, and
10 (2) the child has regular, ongoing opportunities to
11 engage in age-appropriate or developmentally
12 appropriate activities.
13 c. When a planned alternative permanent placement is the
14 court-ordered permanency plan for the child, the court
15 shall at each permanency hearing:
16 (1) ask the child about the permanency outcome the
17 child desires, and
18 (2) make a judicial determination, as of the date of
19 the hearing, why a planned alternative permanent
20 placement is the best permanency plan for the
21 child and provide compelling reasons why it
22 continues to not be in the best interests of the
23 child to return home or be placed for adoption
24 with a legal guardian or with a fit and willing
Req. No. 10851 Page 16

1 relative, taking into consideration whether the
2 child has a close and positive relationship with
3 the parent.
4 F. In addition to the findings required under subsection E of
5 this section, the court shall also make written findings related to:
6 1. Whether the Department has made reasonable efforts to
7 finalize the permanency plan that is in effect for the child and a
8 summary of the efforts the Department has made; or, in the case of
9 an Indian child, whether the Department has made active efforts to
10 provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs as required by
11 25 U.S.C., Section 1912(d);
12 2. If the permanency plan is for the child to remain in out-of-
13 home care, whether the child's out-of-home placement continues to be
14 appropriate and in the best interests of the child;
15 3. If the current placement is not expected to be permanent,
16 the court's projected timetable for return home or for placement in
17 an adoptive home with a guardian, or another planned permanent
18 living arrangement; and
19 4. Whether reasonable efforts, in accordance with the safety or
20 well-being of any child, have been made to:
21 a. place siblings, who have been removed, together in the
22 same foster care, guardianship, or adoptive placement,
23 and
24
Req. No. 10851 Page 17

1 b. provide for frequent visitation or other ongoing
2 interaction in the case of siblings who have been
3 removed and who are not placed together.
4 G. The court may make appropriate orders to ensure timely
5 implementation of the permanency plan and shall order the plan to be
6 accomplished within a specified period of time.
7 SECTION 4. AMENDATORY 12 O.S. 2021, Section 591, is
8 amended to read as follows:
