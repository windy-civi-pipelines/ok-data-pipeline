18 SECTION 1. NEW LAW A new section of law to be codified
19 in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 1161.1 of Title 22, unless there
20 is created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:
21 A. In matters governing individuals who have been adjudicated
22 not guilty by reason of mental illness, it is the intent of the
23 Legislature to ensure the protection of the public while also
24 providing to these individuals the appropriate care they deserve.
Req. No. 11435 Page 1

1 This care includes, but is not limited to: therapeutic
2 interventions, psychiatric treatment, support services, relevant
3 clinical services, protection from harm, administrative oversight,
4 and judicial oversight. While recognizing that some individuals may
5 require permanent institutional care and oversight, the focus should
6 always be upon a recovery-based model of treatment. Best efforts
7 should be utilized by the State of Oklahoma, through the Department
8 of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services (ODMHSAS) to secure
9 adequate facilities for the delivery of treatment and services for
10 these individuals. Likewise, meaningful administrative oversight by
11 ODMHSAS should be established to shepherd these individuals safely
12 and securely while under its care and supervision. Courts provide
13 invaluable oversight regarding compliance by ODMHSAS and these
14 individuals. As such, Courts should exercise their ability to
15 frequently monitor the progress, or lack thereof of ODMHSAS and
16 these individuals while receiving treatment or supervision.
17 B. The ODMHSAS shall prepare and maintain a written
18 individualized service plan for any person who has been adjudicated
19 to be not guilty by reason of mental illness (NGRI/MI). Integral to
20 the development of the service plan is obtaining a comprehensive
21 psychological evaluation upon admission to include any relevant
22 psychological testing, structured risk assessment, and treatment
23 recommendations. Additionally, upon admission a comprehensive
24

11 The protection of the public as well as the health and safety of the
12 individual shall be the paramount concern in the development of the
13 plan.
14 2. If any part of the plan is disputed or not approved by the
15 court, an evidentiary hearing may be held and at its conclusion, the
16 court shall determine the content of the individualized service plan
17 in accord with the evidence presented and the best interests of the
