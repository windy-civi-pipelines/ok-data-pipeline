9 SECTION 9. NEW LAW A new section of law to be codified
10 in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 479.9 of Title 59, unless there
11 is created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:
12 A. The State Board of Medical Licensure and Supervision, in
13 consultation with the State Board of Osteopathic Examiners, shall
14 promulgate rules applicable to graduate physicians that are
15 consistent with the guidelines established for federally funded
16 clinics. The rulemaking authority granted to the State Board of
17 Medical Licensure and Supervision in this subsection does not extend
18 to graduate physician collaborative practice arrangements of
19 hospital employees providing inpatient care within hospitals.
20 B. The State Board of Medical Licensure and Supervision or the
21 State Board of Osteopathic Examiners shall not deny, revoke,
22 suspend, or otherwise take disciplinary action against a
23 collaborating physician for services delegated to a graduate
24 physician as long as the provisions of this section and any
Req. No. 10145 Page 10

1 appl icable rules promulgated by the State Board of Medical Licensure
2 and Supervision are satisfied.
3 C. Within thirty (30) days of any licensure change, the State
4 Board of Medical Licensure and Supervision or the State Board of
5 Osteopathic Examiners shall require every physician to identify
6 whether the physician is engaged in a graduate physician
7 collaborative practice arrangement, and to report to the physician’s
8 licensing board the name of each graduate physician with whom the
9 physician has entered into an arrangement. Each board may make the
10 information available to the public. The State Board of Medical
11 Licensure and Supervision shall track the reported information and
12 may routinely conduct reviews or inspections to ensure that the
13 arrangements are being carried out in compliance with this act.
14 D. A contract or other agreement shall not require a physician
15 to act as a collaborating physician for a graduate physician against
16 the physician’s will. A physician has the right to refuse to act as
17 a collaborating physician, without penalty, for a particular
18 graduate physician. A contract or other agreement shall not limit
19 the collaborating physician’s authority over any protocols or
20 standing orders, or delegate the physician’s authority to a graduate
21 physician. However, this subsection does not authorize a physician
22 in implementing protocols, standing orders, or delegation to violate
23 applicable standards for safe medical practice established by a
24 hospital’s medical staff.
Req. No. 10145 Page 11

1 E. A contract or other agreement shall not require a graduate
2 physician to serve as a graduate physician for any collaborating
3 physician against the graduate physician’s will. A graduate
4 physician has the right to refuse to collaborate, without penalty,
5 with a particular physician.
6 F. All collaborating physicians and graduate physicians under a
7 graduate physician collaborative practice arrangement shall wear
8 identification badges while acting within the scope of the
9 arrangement. The identification badges shall prominently display
10 the licensure status of the collaborating physician and the graduate
11 physician.
12 SECTION 10. NEW LAW A new section of law to be codified
13 in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 479.10 of Title 59, unless there
14 is created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:
15 A. The collaborating physician shall complete a certification
16 course, which may include material on the laws pertaining to the
17 professional relationship. The certification course shall be
18 approved by the State Board of Medical Licensure and Supervision or
19 the State Board of Osteopathic Examiners.
20 B. A graduate physician collaborative practice arrangement
21 shall supersede current hospital licensing regulations governing
22 hospital medication orders under protocols or standing orders for
23 the purpose of delivering inpatient or emergency care within a
24 hospital as defined in Section 1-701 of Title 63 of the Oklahoma
Req. No. 10145 Page 12

1 Stat utes, if the protocols or standing orders have been approved by
2 the hospital’s medical staff and pharmaceutical therapeutics
