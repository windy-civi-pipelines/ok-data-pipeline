Effective September 8, 2009, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary of the System, the System, which as a governmental plan
(within the meaning of Section 414(d) of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended), is treated as having complied with Section
401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, for all
years to which Section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended, applies to the System if the System complies with
a reasonable and good faith interpretation of Section 401(a)(9) of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
A member who was required to join the System effective July 1,
1980, because of the transfer of the employing agency from the
Oklahoma Public Employees Retirement System to the System, and was
not a member of the Oklahoma Public Employees Retirement System on
the date of such transfer shall be allowed to receive credit for
prior law enforcement service rendered to this state, if the member
is not receiving or eligible to receive retirement credit or
benefits for such service in any other public retirement system,
upon payment to the System of the employee contribution the member
would have been subject to had the member been a member of the
System at the time, plus five percent (5%) interest. Service credit
received pursuant to this paragraph shall be used in determining the
member's retirement benefit, and shall be used in determining years
of service for retirement or vesting purposes;
9. "Actual paid base salary" means the salary received by a
member, excluding payment for any accumulated leave or uniform
allowance. Salary shall include any amount of nonelective salary
reduction under Section 414(h) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986;
10. "Final average salary" means the average of the highest
thirty (30) consecutive complete months of actual paid gross salary.
ENR. H. B. NO. 1027 Page 6

RBH No. 10296
Gross salary shall include any amount of elective salary reduction
under Section 457 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,
and any amount of nonelective salary reduction under Section 414(h)
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Effective July 1,
1992, gross salary shall include any amount of elective salary
reduction under Section 125 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended. Effective July 1, 1998, gross salary shall include any
amount of elective salary reduction not includable in the gross
income of the member under Section 132(f)(4) of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended. Effective July 1, 1998, for purposes of
determining a member's compensation, any contribution by the member
to reduce his or her regular cash remuneration under Section
132(f)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, shall be
treated as if the member did not make such an election. Only salary
on which required contributions have been made may be used in
computing the final average salary. Gross salary shall not include
severance pay.
In addition to other applicable limitations, and notwithstanding
any other provision to the contrary, for plan years beginning on or
after July 1, 2002, the annual gross salary of each "Noneligible
Member" taken into account under the System shall not exceed the
Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 ("EGTRRA")
annual salary limit. The EGTRRA annual salary limit is Two Hundred
Thousand Dollars ($200,000.00), as adjusted by the Commissioner for
increases in the cost of living in accordance with Section
401(a)(17)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The
annual salary limit in effect for a calendar year applies to any
period, not exceeding twelve (12) months, over which salary is
determined ("determination period") beginning in such calendar year.
If a determination period consists of fewer than twelve (12) months,
the EGTRRA salary limit will be multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of months in the determination
period, and the denominator of which is twelve (12). For purposes
of this section, a "Noneligible Member" is any member who first
became a member during a plan year commencing on or after July 1,
1996.
For plan years beginning on or after July 1, 2002, any reference
in the System to the annual salary limit under Section 401(a)(17) of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, shall mean the EGTRRA
salary limit set forth in this provision.
Effective January 1, 2008, gross salary for a plan year shall
also include gross salary, as described above, for services, but
ENR. H. B. NO. 1027 Page 7

RBH No. 10296
paid by the later of two and one-half (2 1/2) months after a
member's severance from employment or the end of the calendar year
that includes the date the member terminated employment, if it is a
payment that, absent a severance from employment, would have been
paid to the member while the member continued in employment with the
employer.
Effective January 1, 2008, any payments not described above
shall not be considered gross salary if paid after severance from
employment, even if they are paid by the later of two and one-half
(2 1/2) months after the date of severance from employment or the
end of the calendar year that includes the date of severance from
employment, except payments to an individual who does not currently
perform services for the employer by reason of qualified military
service within the meaning of Section 414(u)(5) of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, to the extent these payments do
not exceed the amounts the individual would have received if the
individual had continued to perform services for the employer rather
than entering qualified military service.
Effective January 1, 2008, back pay, within the meaning of
Section 1.415(c)-2(g)(8) of the Income Tax Regulations, shall be
treated as gross salary for the limitation year to which the back
pay relates to the extent the back pay represents wages and
compensation that would otherwise be included in this definition.
Effective for years beginning after December 31, 2008, gross
salary shall also include differential wage payments under Section
414(u)(12) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended;

RBH No. 10296
B. Each member of the System shall make contributions to the
fund in an amount equal to eight percent (8%) of the actual paid

Although the contributions so picked up are designated as member
contributions, such contributions shall be treated as contributions
being paid by the employer in lieu of contributions by the member in
determining tax treatment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986
and such picked up contributions shall not be includable in the
gross income of the member until such amounts are distributed or
made available to the member or the beneficiary of the member. The
member, by the terms of this System, shall not have any option to

ENR. H. B. NO. 1027 Page 11

RBH No. 10296
unused sick leave accumulated while a member of the System. Such
credit shall be added in terms of whole months. Twenty (20) days of
unused sick leave shall equal one (1) month for purposes of service
credit. If unused sick leave entitles a member to an additional
year or fraction thereof of service credit, the member's employer
shall reimburse the System for the cost of funding the additional
reserve by paying the amount determined by the Board pursuant to
Section 25 of this act. Each employer shall provide the System with
adequate and timely information necessary to determine additional
benefits and its cost under this section. This section shall apply
to members retiring or vesting on or after July 1, 1985, and shall
not be retroactive. The amount of accrued sick leave available for
determination of a member's monthly benefit for purposes of the
deferred option election shall be limited to the accrued sick leave
available as of the effective date of the deferred option election,
but not to exceed two hundred forty (240) days. The member's
monthly benefit determined as of the effective date of the deferred
option election shall not be adjusted for additional accrued sick
leave earned by the member after the deferred option election.
B. Whenever any member is unable to perform the member's duties
because of sickness or temporary disability caused or sustained
while in the discharge of the member's duty as a member, is
receiving a temporary total disability benefit under Section 1 et
seq. of Title 85A of the Oklahoma Statutes, and does not purchase
service credit as described below, such member shall only receive
prorated service credit based on the contributions made by the
member and the member's employer while the member is receiving a
temporary total disability benefit under Section 1 et seq. of Title
85A of the Oklahoma Statutes. Whenever any member is unable to
perform the member's duties because of sickness or temporary
disability caused or sustained while in the discharge of the
member's duty as a member and is receiving a temporary disability
benefit under Section 1 et seq. of Title 85A of the Oklahoma
Statutes, such member shall have the option to purchase service
credit for the time related to such leave of absence for such
sickness or temporary disability.
1. The payment for such purchase must be completed no later
than three (3) years from the date the member commenced receipt of a
temporary total disability benefit.
2. The purchase price shall be:

RBH No. 10296
a. the actual paid base salary that the member was
entitled to immediately prior to the member's sickness
or temporary disability minus any vacation or sick
leave payments received by the member during such
sickness or temporary disability, multiplied by,
b. the following percent, as applicable:

member's purchase of service credit, ten percent (10%) of the
employer contribution percentage, pursuant to Section 2-304 of this
title, times the actual paid base salary that the member was
entitled to immediately prior to the member's sickness or temporary
disability minus any vacation or sick leave payments received by the
member during such sickness or temporary disability.
3. The member may purchase such service credit through:
a. a cash lump-sum payment,
b. a trustee-to-trustee transfer of non-Roth funds from a
Code Section 403(b) annuity or custodial account, an
eligible deferred compensation plan described in Code
Section 457(b) which is maintained by an eligible
employer described in Code Section 457(e)(1)(A),
and/or a Code Section 401(a) qualified plan,

Re: RBH No. 10296
RBH No. 10296 adds CLEET certified Police officers employed by
University of Oklahoma or Oklahoma State University to become
participants in the Oklahoma Law Enforcement Retirement System.
Current participants of Oklahoma Teachers Retirement System
contributions will be transferred OLERS to purchase prior years of
service.
RBS No. 10296 is a fiscal bill as defined OPLAAA because it
increases the accrued actuarial liability. The bill will not
increase the unfunded accrued actuarial liability.
I am a member of the American Academy of Actuaries and meet the
Qualification Standards of the American Academy of Actuaries to
render the actuarial opinion herein.
