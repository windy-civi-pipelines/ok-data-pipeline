Section 3:
Section 8C. A. Despite any provision to the contrary,
beginning January 1, 2005 2027, the fair cash value, as determined
by law, on each homestead of an individual head of household whose
gross household income from all sources for the preceding calendar
Req. No. 10806 Page 1
year did not exceed an amount as provided in subsection B of this

Section 4:
section, and which individual head of household who is sixty-five
(65) years of age or older who has occupied the property for a
period of at least ten (10) years prior to the first January 1 date
following the year during which the person attains the age of sixty-
five (65) years, shall not exceed the fair cash value placed upon
the property during the first year in which the individual head of
household was sixty-five (65) years of age or older and had gross
household income from all sources which did not exceed an amount as
provided in subsection B of this section. For purposes of this

Section 5:
section, absence from the homestead for a period not to exceed three
hundred sixty-five (365) days during any ten-year period shall not
disqualify the owner from eligibility. The provisions of this

Section 6:
section shall only be applicable to a homestead with a fair cash
value of Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000.00) or less. For
purposes of this section, the fair cash value shall be determined in
the same manner as provided by Section 8B of Article X of the
Oklahoma Constitution. Subject to the limitations of this section,
the fair cash value shall not exceed such amount as long as the
individual head of household who is sixty-five (65) years of age or
older owns and occupies the property and as long as the gross
household income from all sources does not exceed an amount as
provided in subsection B of this section. If any improvements are
made to the property, the fair cash value of the improvements shall
Req. No. 10806 Page 2
be assessed in accordance with law by the county assessor and added
to the assessed value of the property. Once the fair cash value of
the improvements has been added to the fair cash value of the
property, the total fair cash value shall not exceed the revised
valuation of the property so long as the individual head of
household who is sixty-five (65) years of age or older owns and
occupies the property and so long as the gross household income from
all sources does not exceed an amount as provided in subsection B of
this section. For any individual head of household who is sixty-
five (65) years of age or older prior to January 1, 1997, and has
gross household income from all sources of Twenty-five Thousand
Dollars ($25,000.00) or less in calendar year 1996, the fair cash
value of the real property shall be the fair cash value placed upon
the property on January 1, 1997. If the individual head of
household ceases to own and occupy the property or if the gross
household income from all sources exceeds an amount as provided in
subsection B of this section, the fair cash value of the property
shall be determined as if the provisions of Section 8 of Article X
of the Constitution of the State of Oklahoma or any other provisions
relating to a limitation on the fair cash value of locally assessed
real property had been in effect during the time the property was
valued pursuant to the provisions of this section.
B. The income threshold for the gross household income from all
sources for an individual head of household under this section shall
Req. No. 10806 Page 3
not exceed the amount determined by the United States Department of
Housing and Urban Development to be the estimated median income for
the preceding year for the county or metropolitan statistical area
which includes such county. The Oklahoma Tax Commission shall
provide such information to each county assessor each year as soon
as such information becomes available.

Section 7:
SECTION 2. The Ballot Title for the proposed Constitutional
amendment as set forth in SECTION 1 of this resolution shall be in
the following form:
BALLOT TITLE
Legislative Referendum No. ____ State Question No. ____
THE GIST OF THE PROPOSITION IS AS FOLLOWS:
This measure amends Section 8C of Article 10 of the Oklahoma
Constitution. Increases in fair cash value of homesteads are
limited for individual heads of household age sixty-five (65) or
older. The increase cannot exceed the fair cash value of the
property during the first year in which the owner was sixty-five
(65) years of age or older. This limit applies if the
individual head of household meets both the age requirement and
an income limit determined by the United States Department of
Housing and Urban Development. This measure would eliminate the
income limit requirement. The age limit would not change. The
person would be required to have occupied the homestead for ten
(10) years. A person could be away from the homestead for a
Req. No. 10806 Page 4
period not to exceed three hundred sixty-five (365) days in a
ten-year period and still qualify. The limit on increases in
fair cash value of homestead property would only apply if the
fair cash value of the homestead is Five Hundred Thousand
Dollars ($500,000.00) or less. This value would be determined
the same way as it is determined for all other purposes in the
property tax system.
