last amended by Section 1, Chapter 54, O.S.L. 2024 (22 O.S. Supp.
2024, Section 1101), is amended to read as follows:
Section 1101. A. Except as otherwise provided by law, bail, by
sufficient sureties, shall be admitted upon all arrests in criminal
cases where the offense is not punishable by death and in such cases
it may be taken by any of the persons or courts authorized by law to
arrest, to imprison offenders or to perform pretrial services, or by
the clerk of the district court or his or her deputy, or by the
judge of such courts.
B. In criminal cases where the defendant is currently an
escaped prisoner from the Department of Corrections, the defendant
must be processed back into the Department of Corrections prior to
bail being set on new criminal charges.

C. All persons shall be bailable by sufficient sureties, except
that bail may be denied for:
1. Capital offenses when the proof of guilt is evident, or the
presumption thereof is great;
2. Violent offenses;
3. Offenses where the maximum sentence may be life imprisonment
or life imprisonment without parole;
4. Felony offenses where the person charged with the offense
has been convicted of two or more felony offenses arising out of
different transactions; and

must be great, and it must be on the grounds that no condition of
release would assure the safety of the community or any person.

violation of Section 741 of Title 21 of the Oklahoma Statutes.

Protection from Domestic Abuse Act or a violent crime provided for
in Section 571 of Title 57 of the Oklahoma Statutes, the court shall
