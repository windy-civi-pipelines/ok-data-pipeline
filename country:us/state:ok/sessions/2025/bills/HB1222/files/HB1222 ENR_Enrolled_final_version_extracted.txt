Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services shall solicit or refer
any person evaluated and assessed pursuant to this section for any

subsection, the report shall be furnished to the Department of
Corrections with the judgment and sentence. Any evaluation and
assessment report submitted to the court pursuant to the provisions
of this subsection shall be handled in a manner which will keep such
report confidential from the general public's review. Nothing

double the amount of the fine imposed for the underlying driving
under the influence (DUI) violation which shall be in addition to
any other penalties allowed by this section.

a violation of this section or a violation pursuant to the
provisions of any law of this state or another state prohibiting the
offenses provided for in this section, Section 11-904 of this title,
or paragraph 4 of subsection A of Section 852.1 of Title 21 of the

laboratory that is exempt from the Board rules pursuant to Section
759 of this title, for sixty (60) days from the date of collection.
At any time within that period, the tested person or his or her
attorney may direct that such blood specimen be sent or delivered to
a laboratory of his or her own choosing and approved by the Board
for an independent analysis. Neither the tested person, nor any
agent of such person, shall have access to the additional blood
specimen prior to the completion of the independent analysis, except
the analyst performing the independent analysis and agents of the
analyst.
F. The costs of collecting blood specimens for the purpose of
determining the alcohol or other intoxicating substance thereof, by
or at the direction of a law enforcement officer, shall be borne by
the law enforcement agency employing such officer; provided, if the
person is convicted for any offense involving the operation of a
motor vehicle while under the influence of or while impaired by
alcohol or an intoxicating substance, or both, as a direct result of
the incident which caused the collection of blood specimens, an
amount equal to the costs shall become a part of the court costs of
the person and shall be collected by the court and remitted to the
law enforcement agency bearing the costs. The cost of collecting,
retaining and sending or delivering to an independent laboratory the
excess specimens of blood for independent analysis at the option of
the tested person shall also be borne by such law enforcement
agency. The cost of the independent analysis of such specimen of
blood shall be borne by the tested person at whose option such
analysis is performed. The tested person, or his or her agent,
shall make all necessary arrangements for the performance of such
ENR. H. B. NO. 1222 Page 15
independent analysis other than the forwarding or delivery of such
specimen.
G. Tests of blood or breath for the purpose of determining the
alcohol concentration thereof, and tests of blood for the purpose of
determining the presence or concentration of any other intoxicating
substance therein, under the provisions of this title, whether
administered by or at the direction of a law enforcement officer or
administered independently, at the option of the tested person, on
the excess specimen of such person's blood to be considered valid
and admissible in evidence under the provisions of this title, shall
have been administered in accordance with Section 759 of this title.
H. Any person who has been arrested for any offense arising out
of acts alleged to have been committed while the person was
operating or in actual physical control of a motor vehicle while

the combined influence of alcohol and any other intoxicating
substance who is not requested by a law enforcement officer to
submit to a test shall be entitled to have an independent test of
his or her blood for the purpose of determining its alcohol
concentration or the presence or concentration of any other
intoxicating substance therein, performed by a person of his or her
own choosing who is qualified as stipulated in this section. The
arrested person shall bear the responsibility for making all
necessary arrangements for the administration of such independent
test and for the independent analysis of any specimens obtained, and
bear all costs thereof. The failure or inability of the arrested
person to obtain an independent test shall not preclude the
admission of other competent evidence bearing upon the question of
whether such person was under the influence of alcohol, or any other
intoxicating substance or the combined influence of alcohol and any
other intoxicating substance.
I. Any agency or laboratory certified by the Board or any
agency or laboratory that is exempt from the Board rules pursuant to

upon the allowance of bail and the execution of the requisite
recognizance, bond, or undertaking to the state, the magistrate,
judge, or court shall, if the defendant is in custody, make and sign
an order for discharge. The court, in its discretion, may prescribe
by court rule the conditions under which the court clerk or deputy
court clerk, or the sheriff or deputy sheriff, may prepare and
execute an order of release on behalf of the court.
B. No police officer or sheriff may release a person arrested
for a violation of an ex parte or final protective order as provided
in Sections 60.2 and 60.3 of this title, or arrested for an act
constituting domestic abuse as specified in Section 644 of Title 21
of the Oklahoma Statutes, or arrested for any act constituting
domestic abuse, stalking or harassment as defined by Section 60.1 of
this title, or arrested for an act constituting domestic assault and
battery or domestic assault and battery with a deadly weapon
pursuant to Section 644 of Title 21 of the Oklahoma Statutes,
without the violator appearing before a magistrate, judge or court.
To the extent that any of the following information is available to
the court, the magistrate, judge or court shall consider, in
addition to any other circumstances, before determining bond and
other conditions of release as necessary for the protection of the
alleged victim, the following:
1. Whether the person has a history of domestic violence or a
history of other violent acts;
2. The mental health of the person;
3. Whether the person has a history of violating the orders of
any court or governmental entity;

person;
5. Whether the person has a history of abusing alcohol or any

D. No police officer or sheriff may release a person arrested
for any violation of subsection G of Section 2-401 of Title 63 of
the Oklahoma Statutes, without the violator appearing before a
magistrate, judge, or court. In determining bond and other
conditions of release, the magistrate, judge, or court shall
consider any evidence that the person is in any manner dependent
upon a controlled dangerous substance or has a pattern of regular,

dangerous substance or has a pattern of regular illegal use of a
controlled dangerous substance, and the violation referred to in
paragraph 1 of this subsection was committed or attempted in order
to maintain or facilitate the dependence or pattern of illegal use
in any manner.
E. No police officer or sheriff may release a person arrested
for a second or subsequent violation of Section 11-902 of Title 47
of the Oklahoma Statutes, without the granting of bail by a
magistrate, court, judge, or on-call judge, whether by telephone or
in person. In determining bond and other conditions of release, the
magistrate, judge, on-call judge or court shall consider any
evidence that the person is in any manner dependent upon alcohol or
a controlled dangerous substance or has a pattern of regular abuse
of alcohol or the illegal use of any controlled dangerous substance.
If the person was arrested for any crime provided for in Section 11-
902 of Title 47 of the Oklahoma Statutes, the court shall consider
the threat the person poses to the public safety and shall present
written findings on the bail amount.

G. Any person who is found guilty of a violation of the

made in the assessment and evaluation for treatment. The court
shall order the person to reimburse the agency or assessor for the
evaluation and assessment. Payment shall be remitted by the

provided, no state-appropriated funds are utilized. The fee for an
evaluation and assessment shall be the amount provided in subsection
C of Section 3-460 of Title 43A of the Oklahoma Statutes. The
evaluation and assessment shall be conducted at a certified
assessment agency, the office of a certified assessor or at another
location as ordered by the court. The agency or assessor shall,
within seventy-two (72) hours from the time the person is evaluated
and assessed, submit a written report to the court for the purpose
of assisting the court in its sentencing determination. The court
shall, as a condition of any sentence imposed, including deferred
ENR. H. B. NO. 1222 Page 10

and suspended sentences, require the person to participate in and
successfully complete all recommendations from the evaluation, such
as an alcohol and substance abuse treatment program pursuant to
Section 3-452 of Title 43A of the Oklahoma Statutes. If such report
indicates that the evaluation and assessment shows that the
defendant would benefit from a ten-hour or twenty-four-hour alcohol
and drug substance abuse course or a treatment program or both, the
court shall, as a condition of any sentence imposed, including
deferred and suspended sentences, require the person to follow all
recommendations identified by the evaluation and assessment and
ordered by the court. No person, agency or facility operating an
evaluation and assessment program certified by the Department of
Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services shall solicit or refer
any person evaluated and assessed pursuant to this section for any
treatment program or substance abuse service in which such person,
agency or facility has a vested interest; however, this provision
shall not be construed to prohibit the court from ordering
participation in or any person from voluntarily utilizing a
treatment program or substance abuse service offered by such person,
agency or facility. If a person is sentenced to imprisonment in the
custody of the Department of Corrections and the court has received
a written evaluation report pursuant to the provisions of this
subsection, the report shall be furnished to the Department of
Corrections with the judgment and sentence. Any evaluation and
assessment report submitted to the court pursuant to the provisions
of this subsection shall be handled in a manner which will keep such
report confidential from the general public's review. Nothing
contained in this subsection shall be construed to prohibit the
court from ordering judgment and sentence in the event the defendant
fails or refuses to comply with an order of the court to obtain the
evaluation and assessment required by this subsection. If the
defendant fails or refuses to comply with an order of the court to
obtain the evaluation and assessment, the Department of Public
Safety shall not reinstate driving privileges until the defendant
has complied in full with such order. Nothing contained in this
subsection shall be construed to prohibit the court from ordering
judgment and sentence and any other sanction authorized by law for
failure or refusal to comply with an order of the court.
H. Any person who is found guilty of a violation of the
provisions of this section shall be required by the court to attend
a victims impact panel program, as defined in subsection H of
Section 991a of Title 22 of the Oklahoma Statutes, if such a program
is offered in the county where the judgment is rendered, and to pay
a fee of Seventy-five Dollars ($75.00), as set by the governing
ENR. H. B. NO. 1222 Page 11

authority of the program and approved by the court, to the program
to offset the cost of participation by the defendant, if in the
opinion of the court the defendant has the ability to pay such fee.
I. Any person who is found guilty of a felony violation of the
provisions of this section shall be required to submit to electronic
monitoring as authorized and defined by Section 991a of Title 22 of
the Oklahoma Statutes.
J. Any person who is found guilty of a violation of the
provisions of this section who has been sentenced by the court to
perform any type of community service shall not be permitted to pay
a fine in lieu of performing the community service.
K. When a person is found guilty of a violation of the
provisions of this section, the court shall order, in addition to
any other penalty, the defendant to pay a one-hundred-dollar
assessment to be deposited in the Drug Abuse Education and Treatment
Revolving Fund created in Section 2-503.2 of Title 63 of the
Oklahoma Statutes, upon collection.
L. 1. When a person is eighteen (18) years of age or older,
and is the driver, operator, or person in physical control of a
vehicle, and is convicted of violating any provision of this section
while transporting or having in the motor vehicle any child less
than eighteen (18) years of age, the fine shall be enhanced to
double the amount of the fine imposed for the underlying driving
under the influence (DUI) violation which shall be in addition to
any other penalties allowed by this section.
2. Nothing in this subsection shall prohibit the prosecution of
a person pursuant to Section 852.1 of Title 21 of the Oklahoma
Statutes who is in violation of any provision of this section or
Section 11-904 of this title.
M. Any plea of guilty, nolo contendere or finding of guilt for
a violation of this section or a violation pursuant to the
provisions of any law of this state or another state prohibiting the
offenses provided for in this section, Section 11-904 of this title,
or paragraph 4 of subsection A of Section 852.1 of Title 21 of the
Oklahoma Statutes, shall constitute a conviction of the offense for
the purpose of this section; provided, any deferred judgment shall
only be considered to constitute a conviction for a period of ten
(10) years following the completion of any court-imposed
probationary term.
ENR. H. B. NO. 1222 Page 12

N. If qualified by knowledge, skill, experience, training or
education, a witness shall be allowed to testify in the form of an
opinion or otherwise solely on the issue of impairment, but not on
the issue of specific alcohol concentration level, relating to the
following:
1. The results of any standardized field sobriety test
including, but not limited to, the horizontal gaze nystagmus (HGN)
test administered by a person who has completed training in
standardized field sobriety testing; or
2. Whether a person was under the influence of one or more
impairing substances and the category of such impairing substance or
substances. A witness who has received training and holds a current
certification as a drug recognition expert shall be qualified to
give the testimony in any case in which such testimony may be

2. Signed by a duly authorized peace officer that the person
whose blood is to be withdrawn has agreed to the withdrawal of
blood;
3. Signed by a duly authorized peace officer that the person
whose blood is to be withdrawn has been placed under arrest and that
the officer has probable cause to believe that the person, while
intoxicated, has operated a motor vehicle in such manner as to have
caused the death or serious physical injury of another person, or
the person has been involved in a traffic accident and has been
removed from the scene of the accident that resulted in the death or
great bodily injury, as defined in subsection B of Section 646 of
Title 21 of the Oklahoma Statutes, of any person to a hospital or
other health care facility outside the State of Oklahoma before the

offense there are exigent circumstances which necessitate the
withdrawal of blood; or
4. In the form of an order from a district court that blood be
withdrawn, the person authorized to withdraw the blood and the
hospital or other health care facility where the withdrawal occurs
may rely on such a statement or order as evidence that the person
has consented to or has been required to submit to the clinical
procedure and shall not require the person to sign any additional
consent or waiver form. In such a case, the person authorized to
perform the procedure, the employer of such person and the hospital
or other health care facility shall not be liable in any action
alleging lack of consent or lack of informed consent.

liability as a result of the proper withdrawal of blood when acting
at the request of a law enforcement officer by the provisions of

signed statement or court order as provided in this section, if the
act is performed in a reasonable manner according to generally
accepted clinical practice. No person specified in subsection A of
this section shall incur any civil or criminal liability as a result

D. The blood, breath, saliva or urine specimens obtained shall
be tested by the appropriate test as determined by the Board, or
tested by a laboratory that is exempt from the Board rules pursuant
to Section 759 of this title, to determine the alcohol concentration
thereof, or the presence or concentration of any other intoxicating
substance which might have affected the ability of the person tested
to operate a motor vehicle safely.
E. When blood is withdrawn for testing of its alcohol
concentration or other intoxicating substance presence or
concentration, at the request of a law enforcement officer, a
sufficient quantity of the same specimen shall be obtained to enable
the tested person, at his or her own option and expense, to have an
independent analysis made of such specimen. The excess blood
specimen shall be retained by a laboratory approved by the Board in
accordance with the rules and regulations of the Board or by a
laboratory that is exempt from the Board rules pursuant to Section
759 of this title, for sixty (60) days from the date of collection.
At any time within that period, the tested person or his or her
attorney may direct that such blood specimen be sent or delivered to
a laboratory of his or her own choosing and approved by the Board
for an independent analysis. Neither the tested person, nor any
agent of such person, shall have access to the additional blood
specimen prior to the completion of the independent analysis, except
the analyst performing the independent analysis and agents of the
analyst.
F. The costs of collecting blood specimens for the purpose of
determining the alcohol or other intoxicating substance thereof, by
or at the direction of a law enforcement officer, shall be borne by
the law enforcement agency employing such officer; provided, if the
person is convicted for any offense involving the operation of a
motor vehicle while under the influence of or while impaired by
alcohol or an intoxicating substance, or both, as a direct result of
the incident which caused the collection of blood specimens, an
amount equal to the costs shall become a part of the court costs of
the person and shall be collected by the court and remitted to the
law enforcement agency bearing the costs. The cost of collecting,
retaining and sending or delivering to an independent laboratory the
excess specimens of blood for independent analysis at the option of
the tested person shall also be borne by such law enforcement
agency. The cost of the independent analysis of such specimen of
blood shall be borne by the tested person at whose option such
analysis is performed. The tested person, or his or her agent,
shall make all necessary arrangements for the performance of such
ENR. H. B. NO. 1222 Page 15

independent analysis other than the forwarding or delivery of such
specimen.
G. Tests of blood or breath for the purpose of determining the
alcohol concentration thereof, and tests of blood for the purpose of
determining the presence or concentration of any other intoxicating
substance therein, under the provisions of this title, whether
administered by or at the direction of a law enforcement officer or
administered independently, at the option of the tested person, on
the excess specimen of such person's blood to be considered valid
and admissible in evidence under the provisions of this title, shall
have been administered in accordance with Section 759 of this title.
H. Any person who has been arrested for any offense arising out
of acts alleged to have been committed while the person was
operating or in actual physical control of a motor vehicle while
under the influence of alcohol, any other intoxicating substance or
the combined influence of alcohol and any other intoxicating
substance who is not requested by a law enforcement officer to
submit to a test shall be entitled to have an independent test of
his or her blood for the purpose of determining its alcohol
concentration or the presence or concentration of any other
intoxicating substance therein, performed by a person of his or her
own choosing who is qualified as stipulated in this section. The
arrested person shall bear the responsibility for making all
necessary arrangements for the administration of such independent
test and for the independent analysis of any specimens obtained, and
bear all costs thereof. The failure or inability of the arrested
person to obtain an independent test shall not preclude the
admission of other competent evidence bearing upon the question of
whether such person was under the influence of alcohol, or any other
intoxicating substance or the combined influence of alcohol and any
other intoxicating substance.
I. Any agency or laboratory certified by the Board or any
agency or laboratory that is exempt from the Board rules pursuant to
Section 759 of this title, which analyses blood shall make available
a written report of the results of the test administered by or at
the direction of the law enforcement officer to:
1. The tested person, or his or her attorney;
2. The Commissioner of Public Safety;
3. The Director of Service Oklahoma; and
ENR. H. B. NO. 1222 Page 16

4. The Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) analyst of the
state, upon request.

admissible in all civil actions, including administrative hearings
regarding driving privileges.
SECTION 5. This act shall become effective November 1, 2025.
