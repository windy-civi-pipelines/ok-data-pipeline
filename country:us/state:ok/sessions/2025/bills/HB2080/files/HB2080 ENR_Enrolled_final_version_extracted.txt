in the account, the credit union will hold the funds for or pay the
funds them to the named primary beneficiary or beneficiaries, if

this subsection. All designated primary P.O.D. beneficiaries shall
have equal shares. All designated contingent P.O.D. beneficiaries
shall have equal shares as if the sole primary beneficiary is
deceased. In the event of the death of a beneficiary prior to the
death of the account owner, the share of that beneficiary shall be
divided among any surviving beneficiaries or distributed to
