apportion such cost among the various recipients of revenues from

23
24

collection authorized of all recipients from all their mill rates
3
4
levied for the preceding year. The cost shall include only those
4
5
expenses directly attributable to the visual inspection program and
5

of the county assessor which, in the judgment of the county excise
8
9
board or county budget board, are expenses of county assessor’s
9
10

absence of physical on-site inspection of personal property.

12

rates to be established by the board for each such recipient for the
20

1
2
recipient notifies the board in writing that there are no funds

appropriated to pay the amount of the billing statement for such
3
4
sinking fund, such notice shall constitute conclusive evidence of a
4
5
financial obligation of the recipient as it relates to such sinking
5
6
fund. The board may seek a judgment for the amount of such
6
7
obligation and court costs in the district court of the county in

19
in this paragraph should equal a total of one hundred percent
19
20
(100%);

3
4
assessor and the percentage that visual inspection program expenses

11
12
rates are not subject to review and approval by the county excise
12
13
board, the county assessor shall nevertheless include any such
13
14
jurisdiction in the calculations required under subsection A of this
14

15
16
to any such jurisdiction showing the charge for the current fiscal
16
17
year due from the jurisdiction. Such billing statement shall also
17
18
show all the information specified in subsection D of this section.
18
19
Such billing statement shall clearly indicate that the charge
19
20
payable by the jurisdiction is due and payable by December 31 of the
20
21
current fiscal year.
