Req. No. 1451 Page 8

person with legal interest notice of the injury or loss or two (2)
1
2
years from the date of the injury or loss, whichever occurs earlier.

the property.
6
7
C. An action shall not be brought against a museum to recover
7
8
property on loan more than two (2) years from the date of the last
8
9
written contact between the lender or person with legal interest and
9
10
the museum as evidenced by the museum’s records.
10
11
D. A lender is considered to have donated loaned property to
11
12
the museum if the lender fails to file an action to recover the
12
13
property on loan to the museum within the time periods specified in
13
14
subsections A through C of this section.
14
15
E. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections C and D of
15
16
this section, a lender who was not given notice as provided in this
16
17
act, and who proves that the museum received an adequate notice of
17
18
intent to preserve an interest in loaned property within the two (2)
18
19
years immediately preceding the filing of an action to recover the
19
20
property, may recover the property or, if the property has been

disposed of plus interest at the legal rate.
22
23
F. A museum is not liable at any time, in the absence of a

24
Req. No. 1451 Page 9

1
person other than the lender has filed a notice of intent to
1
2
preserve an interest in property. If a person claims competing
2
3
interests in property in the possession of a museum, the burden is
3
4
upon the claimant to prove the interest in an action in equity
4
5
initiated by a claimant. A museum is not liable at any time for
5
6
returning property to an uncontested claimant who produced
6
7
reasonable proof of ownership or the existence of a security
7
8
interest.
8
9
G. Loaned property in the possession of a museum at the time of
9
10
the owner’s death, which would otherwise escheat to the state, shall
10
11
not escheat but shall be property of the museum to which it is
11
12
loaned.
12
13
SECTION 6. This act shall become effective November 1, 2025.
