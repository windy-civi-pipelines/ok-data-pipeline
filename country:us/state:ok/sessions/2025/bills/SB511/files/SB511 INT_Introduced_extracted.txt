7
8
skill for the protection, improvement, safekeeping,
8

10
11
possession, for the compensation, if any, which is due
11
12
to such person from the owner for such service.

13
Charges owed under a contract primarily for the

18
19
the special lien shall be subordinate to any perfected
19
20
security interest unless the claimant complies with
20
21
the requirements of this section. Failure to comply
21
22
with any requirements of this section shall result in
22
23

10
be mailed, the personal property must have been
10
11
possessed by the possessory lien claimant for at least
11
12
twenty-one (21) days. Furthermore, if the denial was
12
13
due to error by the party submitting the title
13
14
application, then no additional fee for the
14
15
resubmission shall be charged to the property owner.

vehicle, utility vehicle, manufactured home,
2
3
motorcycle, boat, outboard motor, or trailer that is

15
16

19
20
security interest unless the claimant complies with
20
21
the requirements of this section. Failure to comply
21

10
be mailed, the personal property must have been
10
11

11
12
twenty-one (21) days. Furthermore, if the denial was
12
13
due to error by the party submitting the title
13
14
application, then no additional fee for the
14
15
resubmission shall be charged to the property owner.
