1 B. An approved company whose agreement provides that it shall
2 expend approved costs of more than Five Hundred Thousand Dollars
3 ($500,000.00) for a tourism attraction project but less than One
4 Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) shall be entitled to a sales tax
5 credit if the company certifies to the Tax Commission that it has
6 expended at least the minimum amount in approved costs, and the
7 Executive Director certifies that the approved company is in
8 compliance with the Oklahoma Tourism Development Act. The Tax
9 Commission shall then issue a tax credit memorandum to the approved
10 company granting a sales tax credit in the amount of up to ten
11 percent (10%) of the approved costs, but limited to the percent of
12 the approved costs that will result in the project being revenue-
13 neutral to this state as determined by the Oklahoma Department of
14 Commerce. Subsequent requests for credit for additional certified
15 approved costs in excess of the minimum amount for each project as
16 listed in this subsection but less than One Million Dollars
17 ($1,000,000.00) shall result in a sales tax credit in the amount of
18 up to ten percent (10%) of the approved costs, but limited to the
19 percent of the approved costs that will result in the project being
20 revenue-neutral to this state as determined by the Oklahoma
21 Department of Commerce. Sales tax credits allowed pursuant to the
22 provisions of the Oklahoma Tourism Development Act shall not be
23 transferable or assignable; provided that, with respect to a tourism
24 attraction project that is an Entertainment District, the approved
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2894 Page 2

1 comp any can elect to pass-through all or a portion of the sales tax
2 credit to one or more Entertainment District Tenant Parties. The
3 approved company and the Entertainment District Tenant Party shall
4 jointly file a copy of the written credit pass-through agreement
5 with the Oklahoma Tax Commission within thirty (30) days of the
6 effective date of the agreement. Such filing of the agreement with
7 the Oklahoma Tax Commission shall perfect such agreement. The
8 written agreement shall contain the name, address and taxpayer
9 identification number of the parties to the agreement, the amount of
10 credit being passed-through, the month and year the credit was
11 originally allowed to the approved company, the month and tax year
12 or years for which the credit may be claimed, and a representation
13 by the approved company that the approved company has neither
14 claimed for its own behalf nor conveyed such credits to any other
15 Entertainment District Tenant Party. The Tax Commission shall
16 develop a standard form for use by an approved company and an
17 Entertainment District Tenant Party demonstrating eligibility for
18 the Entertainment District Tenant Party to utilize the sales tax
19 credit. The Tax Commission shall develop a system to record and
20 track the pass-through of the sales tax credit and certify the
21 ownership of the sales tax credit and may promulgate rules to permit
22 verification of the validity and timeliness of a sales tax credit
23 claimed upon a sales tax return pursuant to this subsection but
24 shall not promulgate any rules which unduly restrict or hinder the
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2894 Page 3

1 pass -through of such sales tax credit to an Entertainment District
2 Tenant Party.
3 An approved company whose agreement provides that it shall
4 expend approved costs in excess of One Million Dollars
5 ($1,000,000.00) shall be entitled to a sales tax credit if the
6 company certifies to the Tax Commission that it has expended at
7 least One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) in approved costs and the
8 Executive Director certifies that the approved company is in
9 compliance with the Oklahoma Tourism Development Act. The Tax
10 Commission shall then issue a tax credit memorandum to the approved
11 company granting a sales tax credit in the amount of up to twenty-
12 five percent (25%) of the approved costs, but limited to the percent
13 of the approved costs that will result in the project being revenue-
14 neutral to this state as determined by the Oklahoma Department of
15 Commerce. The credit on all subsequent additional certified
16 approved costs shall be in the amount of up to twenty-five percent
17 (25%) of the costs, but limited to the percent of the approved costs
18 that will result in the project being revenue-neutral to this state
19 as determined by the Oklahoma Department of Commerce. For a tourism
20 attraction project that is an Entertainment District, an approved
21 company may elect to receive an incentive payment based on sales tax
22 collections of Entertainment District Tenant Parties rather than a
23 sales tax credit. The incentive payment shall be in the amount of
24 up to twenty-five percent (25%) of the approved costs but limited to
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2894 Page 4

1 the percent of the approved costs that will result in the project
2 being revenue-neutral to this state as determined by the Oklahoma
3 Department of Commerce; provided that, (A) in no event shall the
4 incentive payments exceed the increased state sales tax liability of
5 the approved company and the Entertainment District Tenant Parties
6 that is actually received by the Tax Commission, and (B) the
7 approved company shall be entitled to receive only ten percent (10%)
8 of the incentive payment amount during each calendar year. The Tax
9 Commission shall issue an incentive payment memorandum to the
10 approved company granting a right to receive an incentive payment
11 from the Tax Commission in the amount of up to twenty-five percent
12 (25%) of the approved costs but limited to the percent of the
13 approved costs that will result in the project being revenue-neutral
14 to this state as determined by the Oklahoma Department of Commerce.
15 As soon as practicable after the end of each calendar year during
16 the term of the agreement, the approved company shall file a claim
17 for the incentive payment with the Tax Commission, and the Tax
18 Commission shall be responsible for ensuring that the amount of the
19 incentive payment claimed does not exceed the increased state sales
20 tax liability of the approved company and the Entertainment District
21 Tenant Parties that has been actually received by the Tax
22 Commission, which may include accessing the Oklahoma sales tax
23 returns of the Entertainment District Tenant Parties as permitted by
24 this section.

15 authorize inducements for approved costs expended up to five (5)
16 years from the date the agreement was signed if the Executive

21 2. An original completion date for the tourism attraction, as
22 originally planned, which will be more than three (3) years from the
