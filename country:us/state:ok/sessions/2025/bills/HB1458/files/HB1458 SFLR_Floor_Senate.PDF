13 therein, the probate requirement provided for in Section 1 et seq.
14 of Title 58 of the Oklahoma Statutes shall not be waived.
15 3. After paying any death benefits or unpaid contributions to
16 any claiming heirs as provided pursuant to this subsection, the

21 this subsection or into the payment of any estate tax liability.
