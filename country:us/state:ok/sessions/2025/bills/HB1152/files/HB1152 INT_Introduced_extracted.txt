Req. No. 12165 Page 1
1 case s involving the acquisition by sale or donation of property with
2 a low fair market value as such value is defined by federal law or
3 regulation.;
4 3. Before the initiation of negotiations for real property, an
5 amount shall be established which is reasonably believed to be just
6 compensation therefor and such amount shall be promptly offered for
7 the property. In no event shall such amount be less than the
8 approved appraisal of one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the fair
9 market value of such real property. Any decrease or increase in the
10 fair market value of real property prior to the date of valuation
11 caused by the public improvement for which such property is
12 acquired, or by the likelihood that the property would be acquired
13 for such improvement, other than that due to physical deterioration
14 within the reasonable control of the owner, will be disregarded in
15 determining the compensation for the property. The owner of the
16 real property to be acquired shall be provided with a written
17 statement of, and summary of the basis for, the amount established
18 as just compensation. Where appropriate, the just compensation for
19 the real property acquired and for damages to remaining real
20 property shall be separately stated.;
21 4. No owner shall be required to surrender possession of real
22 property before the agreed purchase price is paid or deposited with

2 property, or the amount of the award of compensation in the
3 condemnation proceeding of such property.;
4 5. The construction or development of a public improvement
5 shall be so scheduled that, to the greatest extent practicable, no

8 Oklahoma Relocation Assistance Act, will be available, or to move
9 his their business or farm operation without at least ninety (90)
10 days' written notice from the date by which such move is required.;
11 6. If any owner or tenant is permitted to occupy the real
12 property acquired on a rental basis for a short term or for a period
13 subject to termination on short notice, the amount of rent required
14 shall not exceed the fair rental value of the property to a short-
15 term occupier.;
16 7. In no event shall the time of condemnation be advanced, on
17 negotiations or condemnation and the deposit of funds in court for
18 the use of the owner be deferred, or any other coercive action be
19 taken to compel an agreement on the price to be paid for the
20 property.;

2 proceedings to prove the fact of the taking of his real property.;

4 its owner with an uneconomic remnant, an offer to acquire that
5 remnant shall be made. For the purposes of this section, an
6 uneconomic remnant is a parcel of real property in which the owner
7 is left with an interest after the partial acquisition of the
8 property of the owner which has little or no value or utility to the
9 owner.;

18 and impartially prepared by a qualified appraiser
19 setting forth an opinion of defined value of an
20 adequately described property as of a specific date,
21 supported by the presentation and analysis of relevant
22 market information, and
23 b. "Acquiring agency" means:
24
Req. No. 12165 Page 4
