11 property and payroll, each comprising twenty-five percent (25%) of
12 the apportionment factor and sales comprising fifty percent (50%) of
13 the apportionment factor. The apportionment factors shall be
14 computed as follows:
15 a. The property factor is a fraction, the numerator of
16 which is the average value of the taxpayer’s real and
17 tangible personal property owned or rented and used in
18 this state during the tax period and the denominator
19 of which is the average value of all the taxpayer’s

17 Oklahoma this state bears to total mileage
18 traveled by such employees,

1 this state as shown in its annual report to the
2 Corporation Commission.
3 (3) In the case of an airline, truck or bus
4 enterprise or freight car, tank car, refrigerator

12 a uniform system of accounts prescribed by such
13 Commission, the intrastate net income shall be
14 determined separately in the manner provided by
15 such uniform system of accounts and only the

17 pursuant to the provisions of this subsection.
18 Provided further, that the gross revenue factors
19 shall be those as are determined pursuant to the
20 accounting procedures prescribed by the Federal
21 Communications Commission.
22 In any case where the apportionment of the three factors
23 prescribed in this paragraph attributes to Oklahoma this state a
24 portion of net income of the enterprise out of all appropriate
SENATE FLOOR VERSION - SB60 SFLR Page 16
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)
1 prop ortion to the property owned and/or business transacted within
2 this state, because of the fact that one or more of the factors so
3 prescribed are not employed to any appreciable extent in furtherance
4 of the enterprise; or because one or more factors not so prescribed
5 are employed to a considerable extent in furtherance of the
6 enterprise; or because of other reasons, the Tax Commission is
7 empowered to permit, after a showing by taxpayer that an excessive
8 portion of net income has been attributed to Oklahoma this state, or
9 require, when in its judgment an insufficient portion of net income
10 has been attributed to Oklahoma this state, the elimination,
11 substitution, or use of additional factors, or reduction or increase
12 in the weight of such prescribed factors. Provided, however, that
13 any such variance from such prescribed factors which has the effect
14 of increasing the portion of net income attributable to Oklahoma
15 this state must not be inherently arbitrary, and application of the
16 recomputed final apportionment to the net income of the enterprise
17 must attribute to Oklahoma this state only a reasonable portion
18 thereof.
19 6. For calendar years 1997 and 1998, the owner of a new or
20 expanded agricultural commodity processing facility in this state
21 may exclude from Oklahoma taxable income, or in the case of an
22 individual, the Oklahoma adjusted gross income, fifteen percent

SENATE FLOOR VERSION - SB60 SFLR Page 17
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)
1 and all subsequent years, the percentage, not to exceed fifteen
2 percent (15%), available to the owner of a new or expanded
3 agricultural commodity processing facility in this state claiming
4 the exemption shall be adjusted annually so that the total estimated
5 reduction in tax liability does not exceed One Million Dollars
6 ($1,000,000.00) annually. The Tax Commission shall promulgate rules
7 for determining the percentage of the investment which each eligible
8 taxpayer may exclude. The exclusion provided by this paragraph
9 shall be taken in the taxable year when the investment is made. In
10 the event the total reduction in tax liability authorized by this
11 paragraph exceeds One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) in any
12 calendar year, the Tax Commission shall permit any excess over One
13 Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) and shall factor such excess into
14 the percentage for subsequent years. Any amount of the exemption
15 permitted to be excluded pursuant to the provisions of this
16 paragraph but not used in any year may be carried forward as an
17 exemption from income pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph
18 for a period not exceeding six (6) years following the year in which
19 the investment was originally made.
20 For purposes of this paragraph:
21 a. “Agricultural commodity processing facility” means

11 property and payroll, each comprising twenty-five percent (25%) of
12 the apportionment factor and sales comprising fifty percent (50%) of
13 the apportionment factor. The apportionment factors shall be
14 computed as follows:
15 a. The property factor is a fraction, the numerator of
16 which is the average value of the taxpayer’s real and
17 tangible personal property owned or rented and used in
18 this state during the tax period and the denominator
19 of which is the average value of all the taxpayer’s
20 real and tangible personal property everywhere owned

18 (3) The average value of property shall be determined
19 by averaging the values at the beginning and

21 Commission may require the averaging of monthly
22 values during the tax period if reasonably
23 required to reflect properly the average value of
24 the taxpayer’s property;

12 of such expenditure in connection with employees
13 operating equipment over a fixed route, such as
14 railroad employees, airline pilots, or bus
15 drivers, in this state only a part of the time,
16 in the proportion that mileage traveled in
17 Oklahoma this state bears to total mileage
18 traveled by such employees,
19 (2) In any case the numerator of the fraction shall
20 include a portion of such expenditures in
21 connection with itinerant employees, such as
22 traveling salespersons, in this state only a part
23 of the time, in the proportion that time spent in

1 Oklahoma this state bears to total time spent in
2 furtherance of the enterprise by such employees;
3 c. The sales factor is a fraction, the numerator of which
4 is the total sales or gross revenue of the taxpayer in
5 this state during the tax period, and the denominator
6 of which is the total sales or gross revenue of the
7 taxpayer everywhere during the tax period. “Sales”,
8 as used in this subsection, does not include sales or
9 gross revenue which are separately allocated in
10 paragraph 4 of this subsection.
11 (1) Sales of tangible personal property have a situs

SENATE FLOOR VERSION - SB60 SFLR Page 14
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)

1 this state as shown in its annual report to the
2 Corporation Commission.
3 (3) In the case of an airline, truck or bus
4 enterprise or freight car, tank car, refrigerator
5 car or other railroad equipment enterprise, the
6 numerator of the fraction shall include a portion
7 of revenue from interstate transportation in the
8 proportion that interstate mileage traveled in
9 Oklahoma this state bears to total interstate
10 mileage traveled.
11 (4) In the case of an oil, gasoline or gas pipeline
12 enterprise, the numerator of the fraction shall
13 be either the total of traffic units of the
14 enterprise within Oklahoma this state or the
15 revenue allocated to Oklahoma this state based
16 upon miles moved, at the option of the taxpayer,
17 and the denominator of which shall be the total
18 of traffic units of the enterprise or the revenue
19 of the enterprise everywhere as appropriate to
20 the numerator. A “traffic unit” is hereby
21 defined as the transportation for a distance of
22 one (1) mile of one (1) barrel of oil, one (1)
23 gallon of gasoline or one thousand (1,000) cubic
24
SENATE FLOOR VERSION - SB60 SFLR Page 15
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)

1 feet of natural or casinghead gas, as the case

3 (5) In the case of a telephone or telegraph or other
4 communication enterprise, the numerator of the
5 fraction shall include that portion of the
6 interstate revenue as is allocated pursuant to
7 the accounting procedures prescribed by the
8 Federal Communications Commission; provided that
9 in respect to each corporation or business entity
10 required by the Federal Communications Commission
11 to keep its books and records in accordance with
12 a uniform system of accounts prescribed by such
13 Commission, the intrastate net income shall be
14 determined separately in the manner provided by
15 such uniform system of accounts and only the
16 interstate income shall be subject to allocation
17 pursuant to the provisions of this subsection.
18 Provided further, that the gross revenue factors
19 shall be those as are determined pursuant to the
20 accounting procedures prescribed by the Federal
21 Communications Commission.
22 In any case where the apportionment of the three factors
23 prescribed in this paragraph attributes to Oklahoma this state a
24 portion of net income of the enterprise out of all appropriate
SENATE FLOOR VERSION - SB60 SFLR Page 16
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)

1 prop ortion to the property owned and/or business transacted within
2 this state, because of the fact that one or more of the factors so
3 prescribed are not employed to any appreciable extent in furtherance
4 of the enterprise; or because one or more factors not so prescribed
5 are employed to a considerable extent in furtherance of the
6 enterprise; or because of other reasons, the Tax Commission is
7 empowered to permit, after a showing by taxpayer that an excessive
8 portion of net income has been attributed to Oklahoma this state, or
9 require, when in its judgment an insufficient portion of net income
10 has been attributed to Oklahoma this state, the elimination,
11 substitution, or use of additional factors, or reduction or increase
12 in the weight of such prescribed factors. Provided, however, that
13 any such variance from such prescribed factors which has the effect
14 of increasing the portion of net income attributable to Oklahoma
15 this state must not be inherently arbitrary, and application of the
16 recomputed final apportionment to the net income of the enterprise
17 must attribute to Oklahoma this state only a reasonable portion
18 thereof.
19 6. For calendar years 1997 and 1998, the owner of a new or
20 expanded agricultural commodity processing facility in this state
21 may exclude from Oklahoma taxable income, or in the case of an
22 individual, the Oklahoma adjusted gross income, fifteen percent
23 (15%) of the investment by the owner in the new or expanded
24 agricultural commodity processing facility. For calendar year 1999,
SENATE FLOOR VERSION - SB60 SFLR Page 17
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)

1 and all subsequent years, the percentage, not to exceed fifteen
2 percent (15%), available to the owner of a new or expanded
3 agricultural commodity processing facility in this state claiming
4 the exemption shall be adjusted annually so that the total estimated
5 reduction in tax liability does not exceed One Million Dollars
6 ($1,000,000.00) annually. The Tax Commission shall promulgate rules
7 for determining the percentage of the investment which each eligible
8 taxpayer may exclude. The exclusion provided by this paragraph
9 shall be taken in the taxable year when the investment is made. In
10 the event the total reduction in tax liability authorized by this
11 paragraph exceeds One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) in any
12 calendar year, the Tax Commission shall permit any excess over One
13 Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) and shall factor such excess into
14 the percentage for subsequent years. Any amount of the exemption
15 permitted to be excluded pursuant to the provisions of this
16 paragraph but not used in any year may be carried forward as an
17 exemption from income pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph
18 for a period not exceeding six (6) years following the year in which
19 the investment was originally made.
20 For purposes of this paragraph:
21 a. “Agricultural commodity processing facility” means
22 building buildings, structures, fixtures and
23 improvements used or operated primarily for the
24 processing or production of marketable products from

2 dairy operation that requires a depreciable investment
3 of at least Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars
4 ($250,000.00) and which produces milk from dairy cows.
5 The term does not include a facility that provides
6 only, and nothing more than, storage, cleaning, drying
7 or transportation of agricultural commodities, and
8 b. “Facility” means each part of the facility which is
9 used in a process primarily for:
10 (1) the processing of agricultural commodities,
11 including receiving or storing agricultural
12 commodities, or the production of milk at a dairy
13 operation,
14 (2) transporting the agricultural commodities or
15 product before, during or after the processing,
16 or
17 (3) packaging or otherwise preparing the product for
18 sale or shipment.
19 7. Despite any provision to the contrary in paragraph 3 of this
20 subsection, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1999, in
21 the case of a taxpayer which has a farming loss, such farming loss
