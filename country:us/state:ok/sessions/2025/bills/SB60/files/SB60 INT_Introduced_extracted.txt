the apportionment factor. The apportionment factors shall be
13
14
computed as follows:
14
15
a. The property factor is a fraction, the numerator of
15
16
which is the average value of the taxpayer’s real and
16
17
tangible personal property owned or rented and used in
17
18
this state during the tax period and the denominator
18
19
of which is the average value of all the taxpayer’s
19
20
real and tangible personal property everywhere owned
20
21
or rented and used during the tax period.
21
22
(1) Property, the income from which is separately
22
23
allocated in paragraph 4 of this subsection,

14
15
rental rate paid by the taxpayer, less any annual
15
16
rental rate received by the taxpayer from
16
17
subrentals,
17
18
(3) The average value of property shall be determined
18
19
by averaging the values at the beginning and
19
20
ending of the tax period but the Oklahoma Tax
20
21
Commission may require the averaging of monthly
21
22
values during the tax period if reasonably

23
required to reflect properly the average value of
23
24
the taxpayer’s property;
24
Req. No. 73 Page 12

10
11
numerator of the fraction shall include a portion
11
12

13
operating equipment over a fixed route, such as
13
14
railroad employees, airline pilots, or bus
14
15
drivers, in this state only a part of the time,
15
16
in the proportion that mileage traveled in

19
(2) In any case the numerator of the fraction shall
19
20
include a portion of such expenditures in
20
21
connection with itinerant employees, such as

c. The sales factor is a fraction, the numerator of which
3
4
is the total sales or gross revenue of the taxpayer in
4
5
this state during the tax period, and the denominator
5
6
of which is the total sales or gross revenue of the

taxpayer everywhere during the tax period. “Sales”,
7
8
as used in this subsection, does not include sales or
8
9
gross revenue which are separately allocated in
9
10
paragraph 4 of this subsection.
10
11
(1) Sales of tangible personal property have a situs
11

22
In any case where the apportionment of the three factors
22
23
prescribed in this paragraph attributes to Oklahoma this state a

24
portion of net income of the enterprise out of all appropriate
24
Req. No. 73 Page 16
1
proportion to the property owned and/or business transacted within
1
2
this state, because of the fact that one or more of the factors so
2
3
prescribed are not employed to any appreciable extent in furtherance
3
4
of the enterprise; or because one or more factors not so prescribed
4
5
are employed to a considerable extent in furtherance of the
5
6
enterprise; or because of other reasons, the Tax Commission is
6
7
empowered to permit, after a showing by taxpayer that an excessive
7
8
portion of net income has been attributed to Oklahoma this state, or
8
9
require, when in its judgment an insufficient portion of net income
9
10
has been attributed to Oklahoma this state, the elimination,
10
11
substitution, or use of additional factors, or reduction or increase
11
12
in the weight of such prescribed factors. Provided, however, that
12
13
any such variance from such prescribed factors which has the effect
13
14
of increasing the portion of net income attributable to Oklahoma
14
15
this state must not be inherently arbitrary, and application of the
15
16
recomputed final apportionment to the net income of the enterprise
16
17
must attribute to Oklahoma this state only a reasonable portion
17
18
thereof.

10
the event the total reduction in tax liability authorized by this

11
12

13
14
the percentage for subsequent years. Any amount of the exemption
14
15
permitted to be excluded pursuant to the provisions of this

January 1, 2000, the three factors shall be apportioned with
10
11
property and payroll, each comprising twenty-five percent (25%) of
11
12
the apportionment factor and sales comprising fifty percent (50%) of
12
13
the apportionment factor. The apportionment factors shall be
13
14
computed as follows:
14
15
a. The property factor is a fraction, the numerator of
15
16
which is the average value of the taxpayer’s real and
16
17
tangible personal property owned or rented and used in
17
18
this state during the tax period and the denominator
18
19
of which is the average value of all the taxpayer’s
19
20
real and tangible personal property everywhere owned
20
21
or rented and used during the tax period.
21
22
(1) Property, the income from which is separately
22
23
allocated in paragraph 4 of this subsection,
23
24
shall not be included in determining this

10
traveled,
10
11
(2) Property owned by the taxpayer is valued at its
11
12
original cost. Property rented by the taxpayer
12
13
is valued at eight times the net annual rental
13
14
rate. Net annual rental rate is the annual
14
15
rental rate paid by the taxpayer, less any annual
15
16
rental rate received by the taxpayer from
16
17
subrentals,
17
18
(3) The average value of property shall be determined
18
19
by averaging the values at the beginning and
19
20
ending of the tax period but the Oklahoma Tax
20
21
Commission may require the averaging of monthly
21
22
values during the tax period if reasonably
22
23
required to reflect properly the average value of
23
24
the taxpayer’s property;
24

b. The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of
1
2
which is the total compensation for services rendered
2
3
in the state during the tax period, and the
3
4
denominator of which is the total compensation for
4
5
services rendered everywhere during the tax period.
5
6
“Compensation”, as used in this subsection, means
6
7
those paid-for services to the extent related to the
7

railroad employees, airline pilots, or bus
14
15
drivers, in this state only a part of the time,
15
16
in the proportion that mileage traveled in
16
17
Oklahoma this state bears to total mileage
17
18
traveled by such employees,
18
19
(2) In any case the numerator of the fraction shall
19
20
include a portion of such expenditures in
20
21
connection with itinerant employees, such as

Oklahoma this state bears to total time spent in
1
2
furtherance of the enterprise by such employees;
2
3
c. The sales factor is a fraction, the numerator of which
3
4
is the total sales or gross revenue of the taxpayer in
4
5
this state during the tax period, and the denominator
5
6
of which is the total sales or gross revenue of the
6
7
taxpayer everywhere during the tax period. “Sales”,
7
8
as used in this subsection, does not include sales or
8
9
gross revenue which are separately allocated in
9
10
paragraph 4 of this subsection.
10
11
(1) Sales of tangible personal property have a situs
11
12
in this state if the property is delivered or
12
13
shipped to a purchaser other than the United
13
14
States government, within this state regardless
14
15
of the FOB Freight on Board (FOB) point or other
15
16
conditions of the sale; or the property is

of revenue from interstate transportation in the
7
8
proportion that interstate mileage traveled in
8
9
Oklahoma this state bears to total interstate
9
10
mileage traveled.
10
11
(4) In the case of an oil, gasoline or gas pipeline
11
12
enterprise, the numerator of the fraction shall
12
13
be either the total of traffic units of the
13
14
enterprise within Oklahoma this state or the
14
15
revenue allocated to Oklahoma this state based
15
16
upon miles moved, at the option of the taxpayer,
16
17
and the denominator of which shall be the total
17
18
of traffic units of the enterprise or the revenue
18
19
of the enterprise everywhere as appropriate to
19
20
the numerator. A “traffic unit” is hereby
20
21
defined as the transportation for a distance of
21

4
5
fraction shall include that portion of the

9
in respect to each corporation or business entity
9
10
required by the Federal Communications Commission
10
11
to keep its books and records in accordance with
11
12
a uniform system of accounts prescribed by such
12
13
Commission, the intrastate net income shall be
13
14
determined separately in the manner provided by
14
15
such uniform system of accounts and only the
15
16
interstate income shall be subject to allocation
16
17
pursuant to the provisions of this subsection.
17
18
Provided further, that the gross revenue factors
18
19
shall be those as are determined pursuant to the

20
accounting procedures prescribed by the Federal
20
21
Communications Commission.
21
22
In any case where the apportionment of the three factors
22
23
prescribed in this paragraph attributes to Oklahoma this state a
23
24
portion of net income of the enterprise out of all appropriate
24
Req. No. 73 Page 16

1
proportion to the property owned and/or business transacted within
1
2
this state, because of the fact that one or more of the factors so
2
3
prescribed are not employed to any appreciable extent in furtherance
3
4
of the enterprise; or because one or more factors not so prescribed
4
5
are employed to a considerable extent in furtherance of the
5
6
enterprise; or because of other reasons, the Tax Commission is
6
7
empowered to permit, after a showing by taxpayer that an excessive
7
8
portion of net income has been attributed to Oklahoma this state, or
8
9
require, when in its judgment an insufficient portion of net income
9
10
has been attributed to Oklahoma this state, the elimination,
10
11
substitution, or use of additional factors, or reduction or increase
11
12
in the weight of such prescribed factors. Provided, however, that
12
13
any such variance from such prescribed factors which has the effect
13
14
of increasing the portion of net income attributable to Oklahoma
14
15
this state must not be inherently arbitrary, and application of the
15
16
recomputed final apportionment to the net income of the enterprise
16
17
must attribute to Oklahoma this state only a reasonable portion
17
18
thereof.

8
taxpayer may exclude. The exclusion provided by this paragraph
8
9
shall be taken in the taxable year when the investment is made. In
9
10
the event the total reduction in tax liability authorized by this
10
11
paragraph exceeds One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) in any
11
12
calendar year, the Tax Commission shall permit any excess over One
12
13
Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) and shall factor such excess into
13
14
the percentage for subsequent years. Any amount of the exemption
14
15
permitted to be excluded pursuant to the provisions of this
