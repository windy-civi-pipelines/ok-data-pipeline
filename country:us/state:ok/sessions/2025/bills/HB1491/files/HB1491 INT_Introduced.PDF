17 membership in public schools statewide based on the
18 preceding school year's average daily membership,
19 according to the provisions of Section 18-107 of this

5 f. for each school district or eligible charter school
6 which is below the baseline local funding per student,
7 the Department shall subtract the baseline local
8 funding per student from the average nonchargeable
9 millage per student of the school district or eligible
10 charter school to determine the nonchargeable millage
11 per student shortfall for each district, and
12 g. the nonchargeable millage per student shortfall for a
13 school district or eligible charter school shall be
14 multiplied by the average daily membership of the

4 appropriated funds are insufficient to fund the redbud school
5 grants, then an additional apportionment of funds shall be made from
6 sales tax collections as provided by subsection D of Section 1353 of
