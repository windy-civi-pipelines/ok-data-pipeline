ENROLLED HOUSE
RESOLUTION NO. 1020 By: West (Tammy) and Lepak
A Resolution recognizing September 21 through
September 28, 2025 as Lezlie Holliday Frontotemporal
Dementia Awareness Week; and expressing the
importance of Lezlie Holliday Frontotemporal Dementia
Awareness Week.
WHEREAS, frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a form of dementia
caused by progressive nerve cell loss in the brain's frontal and
temporal lobes, which variably causes deterioration in behavior,
personality, and/or difficulty with producing or comprehending
language; and
WHEREAS, according to the Association for Frontotemporal
Degeneration, FTD is frequently misdiagnosed as Alzheimer's,
depression, Parkinson's disease, or a psychiatric condition. On
average, it currently takes 3.6 years to get an accurate diagnosis;
and
WHEREAS, most FTD cases occur between the ages of 45 and 64.
Therefore, FTD has a potentially substantially greater impact on
work, family, and finances; and
WHEREAS, the economic burden of FTD is estimated to be $120,000
per year per family; and
WHEREAS, FTD may affect a person's ability to express emotions
and to show affection and empathy; and
WHEREAS, in the behavioral variant of FTD, a person's
personality may be significantly changed and this could manifest as
impaired judgment and responding to social situations in a way that
may be considered inappropriate; and

WHEREAS, in the language variants of FTD (primary progressive
aphasia), a person may have difficulty producing speech and
understanding grammar, lose the meaning of words or become hesitant
in their speech, and may eventually become non-verbal; and
WHEREAS, today, there is no cure for FTD, and no current
treatments available to slow or stop the progression of the disease;
and
WHEREAS, the last week of September has been declared World
Frontotemporal Dementia Awareness Week to raise funds to improve
care and support options, support research for treatments and
ultimately a cure.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
OF THE 1ST SESSION OF THE 60TH OKLAHOMA LEGISLATURE:
THAT the last week of September 21-28, 2025, is hereby
recognized by the Oklahoma House of Representatives and the State of
Oklahoma as Lezlie Holliday Frontotemporal Dementia Awareness Week,
in order to raise public awareness about frontotemporal dementia.
THAT the Oklahoma House of Representatives acknowledges the
critical importance of frontotemporal dementia awareness to improve
brain health in the State of Oklahoma and for research to find a
treatment and possibly a cure.
THAT the Oklahoma House of Representatives supports raising
awareness of the consequences of undiagnosed and misdiagnosed
frontotemporal dementia and the need for appropriate care for
individuals with frontotemporal dementia.
