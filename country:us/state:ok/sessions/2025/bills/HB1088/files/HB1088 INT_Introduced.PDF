4 student for at least three (3) years prior to becoming eligible to
5 apply as a transfer student may be allowed to transfer to the school
6 district regardless of capacity.

9 automatically approved.
10 B. Each school district board of education shall adopt a policy
11 to determine the number of transfer students the school district has
12 the capacity to accept in each grade level for each school site

14 may include:
