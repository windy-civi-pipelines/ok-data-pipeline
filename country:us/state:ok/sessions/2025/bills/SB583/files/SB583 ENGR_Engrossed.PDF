12 SECTION 1. AMENDATORY 68 O.S. 2021, Section 1368.3, is

14 Section 1368.3. A. As used in this section, “noncompliant
15 taxpayer” means any taxpayer operating under a sales tax permit who,
16 within any consecutive twenty-four-month period, has failed to
17 timely file two reports or timely remit tax due for any two (2)
18 months, as required under the provisions of any tax law. Provided,
19 a taxpayer shall not be deemed noncompliant for nonpayment of income
20 taxes.
21 B. In addition to all other remedies provided by law for the
22 collection of unpaid taxes, the Oklahoma Tax Commission may close
23 the business of a noncompliant taxpayer, subject to the
24 administrative and judicial appeal procedures provided in this
ENGR. S. B. NO. 583 Page 1

1 sect ion, if the noncompliant taxpayer, within any consecutive
2 twenty-four-month period, fails to timely file three reports or
3 timely remit tax due for any three (3) months, as required under the
4 provisions of any tax law.
5 C. 1. The Tax Commission shall give notice to a noncompliant
6 taxpayer that the third delinquency in reporting or remitting tax in
7 any consecutive twenty-four-month period will result in the closure
8 of the business. The notice must be in writing and delivered to the
9 noncompliant taxpayer by the United States Postal Service or by hand
10 delivery.
11 2. If the noncompliant taxpayer has a third delinquency in
12 reporting or remitting tax in any consecutive twenty-four-month
13 period after the issuance of the notice provided in paragraph 1 of
14 this subsection, the Tax Commission shall notify the noncompliant
15 taxpayer by certified mail or by hand delivery that the business
16 will be closed within five (5) business days from the date of the
17 delivery or attempted delivery of the notice unless the noncompliant
18 taxpayer makes arrangements with the Tax Commission to satisfy the
19 tax delinquency. When the fifth day falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or
20 legal holiday, the performance of the act is considered timely if it
21 is performed on the next succeeding business day that is not a
22 Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday.
23 D. A noncompliant taxpayer may avoid closure of the business
24 by:
ENGR. S. B. NO. 583 Page 2

5 b. Filing all required reports and remitting all taxes

15 the authorized agent of the noncompliant taxpayer, stating the
16 reasons for opposing the closure of the business and requesting an
17 administrative hearing. The protest shall be timely if filed within
18 five (5) business days after the delivery or attempted delivery of
19 the notice required by paragraph 2 of subsection C of this section.
20 2. A noncompliant taxpayer may request that an administrative

6 the hearing officer.

8 officer appointed by the Tax Commission. The hearing officer will

12 in support of the position of the noncompliant taxpayer.
13 4. The administrative hearing will be held within fourteen (14)
14 calendar days of receipt by the Tax Commission of the request for

16 Commission shall give the noncompliant taxpayer at least five (5)
17 days’ notice of the hearing.

ENGR. S. B. NO. 583 Page 4

1 b. Has had no more than three (3) instances of untimely
2 filed reports or late tax remittances during a
3 consecutive twenty-four-month period.
4 H. 1. The decision of the hearing officer must be rendered in
5 writing with copies delivered to the noncompliant taxpayer by the
6 United States Postal Service or by hand delivery.
7 2. If the decision of the hearing officer is to affirm the
8 closure of the business, the decision shall be submitted in writing
9 and delivered by the United States Postal Service or by hand to the
10 noncompliant taxpayer.
11 3. The noncompliant taxpayer may seek judicial relief from the
12 decision of a hearing officer as provided in Section 225 of Title 68

17 business of a noncompliant taxpayer.
18 J. After being given notice of an order of closure of a
19 business pursuant to this section, it shall be unlawful for any
20 person to continue to operate the business. If a person continues
21 or threatens to continue the unlawful operation of the business
22 after having received proper notice of the closure, upon complaint
23 of the Tax Commission, the person shall be enjoined from further
24 operating or conducting the unlawful business. In all cases where

9 affirmed after administrative or judicial review, the Tax Commission
10 shall affix a written notice to all entrances of the business that:
11 1. Identifies the business as being subject to a business
12 closure order; and
