vote or change their vote. Following such inquiry and before the

voting, pursuant to the provisions of Article V, Section 24 of the

instruct the clerk to record the vote. The clerk shall immediately

recorded, shall advise the presiding officer of the result, and the
presiding officer shall announce the result to the House. No vote
may be changed after it has been recorded.

cast a vote for a member, except as otherwise provided in this rule.

may be punished in a manner the House determines. A person voting
for a member, when not authorized by this rule, shall be barred from
the Chamber and may be further punished as the House considers
proper.

officer of the result, and the presiding officer shall announce the
result to the House. In the event the machine is not operating
properly, those in the affirmative shall arise from their seats and
stand until they are counted aloud by the clerk, then those voting

proposition, or the presiding officer may order a recorded vote upon
the presiding officer's own initiative. All such recorded votes
shall be published in the House Journal.

9.6 – Voting and Division
(a) The electronic voting machine shall be used to record the
vote whenever the ayes and nays are required or ordered. The

to determine the numerical count where a division is requested and
ordered. In the event the machine is not operating properly, all
votes and determinations of quorums may be taken by calling the
roll. If a member's voting device is out of order, the member shall
rise and so announce to the presiding officer and cast said member's
vote orally prior to the declaration of the result of the vote.
Every member shall vote providing the member is in the Chamber at
the time the vote is in progress.

presiding, the member shall use the roll call switch located at the
presiding officer's position upon the dais. When the Speaker is not
presiding, the Speaker may direct the presiding officer to activate
the Speaker's roll call switch in the manner requested by the
Speaker. Any member who is present in the Chamber or is within the

presiding officer while a vote is in progress.
(c) When sufficient time has elapsed for each member to vote,
the presiding officer shall ask if any members present desire to
vote or change their vote. Following such inquiry and before the
electronic voting machine is locked, any member may be excused from
voting, pursuant to the provisions of Article V, Section 24 of the
Oklahoma Constitution.
(d) The presiding officer shall then lock the machine and
instruct the clerk to record the vote. The clerk shall immediately

recorded, shall advise the presiding officer of the result, and the
presiding officer shall announce the result to the House. No vote
may be changed after it has been recorded.
(e) No member may vote for another member, nor may any person
cast a vote for a member, except as otherwise provided in this rule.
A member who votes for another member, except as herein provided,
may be punished in a manner the House determines. A person voting
for a member, when not authorized by this rule, shall be barred from
the Chamber and may be further punished as the House considers
proper.
(f) When a division is requested and ordered, those in the
affirmative or the negative, as the case may be, shall cast their
votes accordingly and the clerk shall activate the electronic voting
machine so as to reflect the individual ayes and nays and the
numerical count, but no permanent record thereof shall be made.
When the vote is completed, the clerk shall advise the presiding
officer of the result, and the presiding officer shall announce the
result to the House. In the event the machine is not operating
properly, those in the affirmative shall arise from their seats and
stand until they are counted aloud by the clerk, then those voting
in the negative shall arise and stand until they are counted, and
the presiding officer shall announce the result.
(g) Except as provided in Rule 8.20(b), all votes on final
passage of bills and resolutions, or the emergency clause thereof,
shall be by recorded votes. One–fifteenth (1/15) of the members
present, a quorum being present, may demand a recorded vote on any
ENR. H. R. NO. 1002 Page 49

proposition, or the presiding officer may order a recorded vote upon
the presiding officer's own initiative. All such recorded votes
shall be published in the House Journal.

vote, and the announcement of the result, no member shall be
recognized and no other business shall be transacted.

move the Previous Question. It shall be put in the following form:
"The Previous Question has been moved. The Question is, shall the
House cease debate and vote immediately on the pending question?"
If the motion for the Previous Question passes, the pending question
shall be put immediately and no member shall be heard to debate it
further or seek to amend it.
9.9 – Motion to Advance Question

move to Advance the Question. If the motion to Advance the Question
passes, no further amendments to the matter considered shall be
allowed and debate shall be limited to fifteen (15) minutes, equally
divided between the proponents and opponents of the question,
provided that no member may speak for more than five (5) minutes.

final vote is taken prior to the consideration of any other
ENR. H. R. NO. 1002 Page 50

business, of said member's intention to present a motion to
reconsider such action, and the presiding officer shall afford any
member such opportunity prior to proceeding to consideration of any
other business.
(b) Unless presented and considered within three (3)
legislative days, including the day upon which notice is served, a
motion to reconsider shall be considered as having failed of
adoption and the measure shall be treated as if the notice had never
been lodged.
(c) A motion to reconsider may be offered immediately or upon
the same day the final vote is taken by the member who served
notice, or by another member with said member's consent. On the
last day of the reconsideration period, any member may seek

of business on the last day of the time period specified for Third
Reading and final passage for House and Senate measures.
(e) On the last day of the time period specified for Third
Reading and final passage for House and Senate measures, a motion to
reconsider, lodged either upon that same day or upon the two (2)
prior legislative days, may be offered by any member upon being
recognized for such motion by the presiding officer.
(f) On any day established as a deadline in Joint Rule 7, no
motion to reconsider shall be recognized except immediately after a
final vote is taken and prior to the consideration of any other
business. A member may move to reconsider which motion shall be
taken up immediately.
(g) For adoption, a motion to reconsider must receive a
majority vote of those elected to and constituting the House. Only
one (1) reconsideration of the final vote on a bill, resolution, or
emergency clause shall be allowed. Except as otherwise specifically
provided in Rule 8.15, no question shall be subject to
reconsideration in the House.

question; provided, that no member may speak for more than ten (10)
minutes.
(c) Prior to consideration of a motion to override the
Governor’s veto, if the returned bill or joint resolution was

published to the House of Representatives as determined by the
presiding officer.

(a) At any time during the daily sessions of the House, a
member recognized by the presiding officer may raise a question as

activated to determine the presence or absence of a quorum, and
shall announce the result.
(b) Whenever it shall be ascertained that a quorum is not
