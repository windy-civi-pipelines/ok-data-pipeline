21 Section 6-101.25. A. Whenever a superintendent decides to
22 recommend that a teacher, administrator, or support employee

24 the superintendent shall state the recommendation in writing,
Req. No. 11360 Page 1

2 such recommendation to the board of education.
3 If the teacher subject to such recommendation is a career
4 teacher, the recommendation shall specify the statutory grounds for

6 If the teacher subject to such recommendation is a probationary
7 teacher, the recommendation shall specify the cause for which the
8 recommendation is based.
9 The superintendent shall also specify the underlying facts
10 supporting the recommendation.
11 B. 1. If the recommendation includes grounds that could form
12 the basis of criminal charges sufficient to result in the denial or
13 revocation of a certificate for a reason set forth in subparagraph a
14 of paragraph 6 of subsection A of Section 3-104 of this title, or if
15 the recommendation includes a reason set forth in subparagraph a of
16 paragraph 6 of subsection A of Section 3-104 of this title and is
17 based on an agreement between the teacher, administrator, or support
18 employee and school district to avoid civil litigation or a
19 settlement of a civil action unless the court orders the terms of
20 such settlement to be kept confidential, a copy of the
21 recommendation shall also be forwarded to the State Board of
22 Education after the completion of due process procedures pursuant to
23 Section 6-101.26 of this title or after the teacher resigns

4 certificate revocation. A report of such resignation, including any
5 investigatory findings to date, shall be forwarded to the State
6 Board of Education. Failure to forward a copy of the recommendation
7 to the State Board of Education shall not be the basis for any claim
8 or action against a public school, its board of education,
9 employees, agents or other representatives. If the school district
10 forwards a copy of the recommendation to the State Board of
11 Education, the school district shall contemporaneously forward a
12 copy to the teacher, administrator, or support employee subject to
13 such recommendation. The teacher, administrator, or support
14 employee may provide supplementary information to the State Board of
15 Education.
16 2. If the investigation into the conduct of the teacher,
17 administrator, or support employee concludes without findings to
18 support criminal charges, certificate revocation, or termination,
19 the individual shall have the right to petition for the expungement
20 of the report from State Board of Education records and written
21 notification of the clearance to all affected parties. Expungement
22 may only occur upon sufficient evidence of no wrongdoing and at the
23 discretion of the State Board of Education.

6 Board of Education shall notify the teacher, administrator, or
7 support employee subject to the recommendation if such a request is
8 made and provide the identity of the school district that made such
9 request. The teacher, administrator, or support employee subject to
