12 this paragraph to determine the nonchargeable millage
13 for each school district,
14 d. add the nonchargeable millage in each district
15 statewide as calculated in subparagraph c of this
16 paragraph and divide the total by the average daily
17 membership in public schools statewide based on the
18 preceding school year's average daily membership,
19 according to the provisions of Section 18-107 of this
20 title. This amount is the statewide nonchargeable

23 e. all eligible charter schools shall be included in
24 these calculations as unique school districts,
Req. No. 13079 Page 16

4 average baseline local funding per student,
5 f. for each school district or eligible charter school
6 which is below the baseline local funding per student,
7 the Department shall subtract the baseline local
8 funding per student from the average nonchargeable
9 millage per student of the school district or eligible
10 charter school to determine the nonchargeable millage
11 per student shortfall for each district, and
12 g. the nonchargeable millage per student shortfall for a
13 school district or eligible charter school shall be
14 multiplied by the average daily membership of the
15 preceding school year of the eligible school district
16 or eligible charter school. This amount shall be the

19 2. For fiscal year 2022, monies for the redbud school grants
20 shall be expended from the funds apportioned pursuant to Section 426

4 appropriated funds are insufficient to fund the redbud school
5 grants, then an additional apportionment of funds shall be made from
6 sales tax collections as provided by subsection D of Section 1353 of
7 Title 68 of the Oklahoma Statutes. If both funds are insufficient,
8 the Department shall promulgate rules to permit a decrease to the

7 the recommendation includes a reason set forth in subparagraph a of
8 paragraph 6 of subsection A of Section 3-104 of this title and is

13 forwarded to the State Board of Education after the completion of
