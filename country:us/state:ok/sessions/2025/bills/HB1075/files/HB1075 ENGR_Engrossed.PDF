4 this paragraph to determine the nonchargeable millage
5 for each school district,
6 d. add the nonchargeable millage in each district

8 paragraph and divide the total by the average daily
9 membership in public schools statewide based on the
10 preceding school year's average daily membership,
11 according to the provisions of Section 18-107 of this
12 title. This amount is the statewide nonchargeable

23 the Department shall subtract the baseline local
24 funding per student from the average nonchargeable
ENGR. H. B. NO. 1075 Page 16

2 charter school to determine the nonchargeable millage
3 per student shortfall for each district, and
4 g. the nonchargeable millage per student shortfall for a
5 school district or eligible charter school shall be
6 multiplied by the average daily membership of the

11 2. For fiscal year 2022, monies for the redbud school grants
12 shall be expended from the funds apportioned pursuant to Section 426
13 of Title 63 of the Oklahoma Statutes. For fiscal year 2023 and each
14 subsequent fiscal year, monies for the redbud school grants shall be
15 appropriated pursuant to Section 426 of Title 63 of the Oklahoma
16 Statutes, not to exceed three-fourths (3/4) of the tax collected in
17 the preceding fiscal year pursuant to Section 426 of Title 63 of the
18 Oklahoma Statutes as determined by the Oklahoma Tax Commission. For
19 fiscal year 2023 and each subsequent fiscal year, if such
20 appropriated funds are insufficient to fund the redbud school
21 grants, then an additional apportionment of funds shall be made from
22 sales tax collections as provided by subsection D of Section 1353 of
23 Title 68 of the Oklahoma Statutes. If both funds are insufficient,
24 the Department shall promulgate rules to permit a decrease to the

17 listing annual redbud school grant recipients, amount awarded to
18 each recipient, and other pertinent information about the Redbud
19 School Funding Act.
20 6. The Department shall provide the chair of the House

21 of paragraph 6 of subsection A of Section 3-104 of this title, or if
22 the recommendation includes a reason set forth in subparagraph a of

8 the teacher or administrator resigns before or after a termination
9 recommendation is made, provided that the resignation occurs while
10 under investigation for conduct that could form the basis for
11 criminal charges or certificate revocation. A report of such
12 resignation, including any investigatory findings to date, shall be
13 forwarded to the State Board of Education. Failure to forward a
14 copy of the recommendation to the State Board of Education shall not

18 State Board of Education, the school district shall
19 contemporaneously forward a copy to the teacher or administrator
20 subject to such recommendation. The teacher or administrator may
21 provide supplementary information to the State Board of Education.

6 recommendation from the State Board of Education, and only if a
7 teacher or administrator is being considered for new employment or a
8 teacher or administrator is currently employed by the requesting
9 school district. The State Board of Education shall notify the
10 teacher or administrator subject to the recommendation if such a
11 request is made and provide the identity of the school district that
12 made such request. The teacher or administrator subject to the
13 recommendation shall retain the right to provide supplementary
14 information to the State Board of Education to accompany any
15 documents requested. The State Board of Education shall provide the
16 requesting school district documents related to the recommendation
17 as well as any supplementary information provided by the teacher or
