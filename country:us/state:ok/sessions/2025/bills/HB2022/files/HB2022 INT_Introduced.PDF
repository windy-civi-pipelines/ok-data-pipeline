Req. No. 11673 Page 9
1 Doll ar ($1.00) per copied page for a certified copy. However, if
2 the request:
3 a. is solely for commercial purpose, or
4 b. would clearly cause excessive disruption of the
5 essential functions of the public body,
6 then the public body may charge a reasonable fee to recover the
7 direct cost of record search and copying; however, publication in a

10 purpose and charges for providing copies of electronic data to the

12 making the copy. The fee charged by the Department of Public Safety
13 for a copy in a computerized format of a record of the Department
14 shall not exceed the direct cost of making the copy unless the fee
15 for the record is otherwise set by law. A public body may require
16 advance payment of the estimated fees authorized under this section
17 when the estimated costs of the record searching, redacting, or
18 copying exceeds Seventy-five Dollars ($75.00). Any portion of an
19 advance payment in excess of the costs in responding to the request

24
Req. No. 11673 Page 10
1 In no case shall a search fee be charged when the release of
2 records is in the public interest, including, but not limited to,
3 release to the news media, scholars, authors and taxpayers seeking
4 to determine whether those entrusted with the affairs of the
5 government are honestly, faithfully, and competently performing
6 their duties as public servants.
7 The fees shall not be used for the purpose of discouraging
8 requests for information or as obstacles to disclosure of requested
9 information;
10 5. 6. The land description tract index of all recorded
11 instruments concerning real property required to be kept by the
12 county clerk of any county shall be available for inspection or
13 copying in accordance with the provisions of the Oklahoma Open
14 Records Act; provided, however, the index shall not be copied or
15 mechanically reproduced for the purpose of sale of the information;
16 6. 7. A public body must provide prompt, reasonable access to
17 its records but may establish reasonable procedures which protect
18 the integrity and organization of its records and to prevent
19 excessive disruptions of its essential functions. A delay in
20 providing access to records shall be limited solely to the time
21 required for preparing the requested documents and the avoidance of
22 excessive disruptions of the public body's essential functions. In
23 no event may production of a current request for records be
24 unreasonably delayed until after completion of a prior records
Req. No. 11673 Page 11
1 requ est that will take substantially longer than the current
2 request. Any public body which makes the requested records
3 available on the Internet shall meet the obligation of providing
4 prompt, reasonable access to its records as required by this
5 paragraph; and
6 7. 8. If a records request is unreasonably vague, open-ended,
7 or otherwise does not describe the requested records with reasonable
8 specificity, a public body may ask the requestor to clarify the
9 request. To have reasonable specificity, a request shall:
10 a. specify at least a general time frame within which the
11 requested records would have been created or
12 transmitted,
13 b. seek identifiable records, rather than general
14 information without any qualifiers or other
15 specifications, and
16 c. include search terms that are sufficiently specific to
17 avoid generating an unreasonably large number of
18 records, such as thousands of pages of emails.
19 If a public body has engaged with the requestor to seek the
20 information needed to fulfill the request and to reach a reasonable
21 solution that accommodates the interests of both the requestor and
22 the public body, including providing the requestor with general
23 topics of records related to the request, the request may be denied
24
Req. No. 11673 Page 12
1 if i t is still not reasonably specific and would excessively disrupt
2 the public body's essential functions; and
3 9. A public body shall designate certain persons who are
4 authorized to release records of the public body for inspection,
5 copying, or mechanical reproduction. At least one person shall be
6 available at all times to release records during the regular
7 business hours of the public body.
8 SECTION 3. AMENDATORY 51 O.S. 2021, Section 24A.17, as
9 amended by Section 3, Chapter 116, O.S.L. 2024 (51 O.S. Supp. 2024,

15 the county jail for a period not exceeding one (1) year, or by both
16 such fine and imprisonment.
17 B. Any person who requests and is denied access to records of a
18 public body or public official:
19 1. May bring a civil suit for declarative or injunctive relief,
20 or both, but such civil suit shall be limited to records requested
21 and denied prior to filing of the civil suit; and
22 2. If successful, shall be entitled to reasonable attorney
23 fees, unless the court finds the public body or public official
24 acted in good faith.
Req. No. 11673 Page 13
1 C. Prior to bringing a civil suit under subsection B of this
2 section, any person seeking declaratory or injunctive relief, or
3 both, must notify the public body or public official of his or her
4 intent to bring a civil suit to obtain relief in writing ten (10)
5 business days prior to filing for such relief. Such notice must
6 also be provided to the Attorney General.
7 D. If the public body or public official successfully defends a
8 civil suit and the court finds that the suit was clearly frivolous,
9 the public body or public official shall be entitled to reasonable
10 attorney fees.

12 for damages for providing access to records as allowed under the
13 Oklahoma Open Records Act.

1 Doll ar ($1.00) per copied page for a certified copy. However, if
2 the request:
3 a. is solely for commercial purpose, or
4 b. would clearly cause excessive disruption of the
5 essential functions of the public body,
6 then the public body may charge a reasonable fee to recover the
7 direct cost of record search and copying; however, publication in a

12 making the copy. The fee charged by the Department of Public Safety
13 for a copy in a computerized format of a record of the Department
14 shall not exceed the direct cost of making the copy unless the fee
15 for the record is otherwise set by law. A public body may require
16 advance payment of the estimated fees authorized under this section
17 when the estimated costs of the record searching, redacting, or
18 copying exceeds Seventy-five Dollars ($75.00). Any portion of an
19 advance payment in excess of the costs in responding to the request

1 In no case shall a search fee be charged when the release of
2 records is in the public interest, including, but not limited to,
3 release to the news media, scholars, authors and taxpayers seeking
4 to determine whether those entrusted with the affairs of the
5 government are honestly, faithfully, and competently performing
6 their duties as public servants.
7 The fees shall not be used for the purpose of discouraging
8 requests for information or as obstacles to disclosure of requested
9 information;
10 5. 6. The land description tract index of all recorded
11 instruments concerning real property required to be kept by the
12 county clerk of any county shall be available for inspection or
13 copying in accordance with the provisions of the Oklahoma Open
14 Records Act; provided, however, the index shall not be copied or
15 mechanically reproduced for the purpose of sale of the information;
16 6. 7. A public body must provide prompt, reasonable access to
17 its records but may establish reasonable procedures which protect
18 the integrity and organization of its records and to prevent
19 excessive disruptions of its essential functions. A delay in
20 providing access to records shall be limited solely to the time
21 required for preparing the requested documents and the avoidance of
22 excessive disruptions of the public body's essential functions. In

24 unreasonably delayed until after completion of a prior records

2 request. Any public body which makes the requested records
3 available on the Internet shall meet the obligation of providing
4 prompt, reasonable access to its records as required by this
5 paragraph; and
6 7. 8. If a records request is unreasonably vague, open-ended,
7 or otherwise does not describe the requested records with reasonable
8 specificity, a public body may ask the requestor to clarify the
9 request. To have reasonable specificity, a request shall:
10 a. specify at least a general time frame within which the
11 requested records would have been created or
12 transmitted,
13 b. seek identifiable records, rather than general
14 information without any qualifiers or other
15 specifications, and
16 c. include search terms that are sufficiently specific to
17 avoid generating an unreasonably large number of
18 records, such as thousands of pages of emails.
19 If a public body has engaged with the requestor to seek the
20 information needed to fulfill the request and to reach a reasonable
21 solution that accommodates the interests of both the requestor and
22 the public body, including providing the requestor with general
23 topics of records related to the request, the request may be denied

2 the public body's essential functions; and
3 9. A public body shall designate certain persons who are
4 authorized to release records of the public body for inspection,
5 copying, or mechanical reproduction. At least one person shall be
6 available at all times to release records during the regular
7 business hours of the public body.

15 the county jail for a period not exceeding one (1) year, or by both
16 such fine and imprisonment.
17 B. Any person who requests and is denied access to records of a
18 public body or public official:
19 1. May bring a civil suit for declarative or injunctive relief,
20 or both, but such civil suit shall be limited to records requested
21 and denied prior to filing of the civil suit; and
22 2. If successful, shall be entitled to reasonable attorney
23 fees, unless the court finds the public body or public official
24 acted in good faith.
Req. No. 11673 Page 13

2 section, any person seeking declaratory or injunctive relief, or
3 both, must notify the public body or public official of his or her

5 business days prior to filing for such relief. Such notice must
6 also be provided to the Attorney General.

8 civil suit and the court finds that the suit was clearly frivolous,
9 the public body or public official shall be entitled to reasonable
10 attorney fees.

12 for damages for providing access to records as allowed under the
13 Oklahoma Open Records Act.
