Req. No. 11025 Page 1

1 Section 2-2-503. A. The following kinds of orders of
2 disposition may be made in respect to children adjudicated in need
3 of supervision or delinquent:
4 1. The court may place the child on probation with or without
5 supervision in the home of the child, or in the custody of a
6 suitable person, upon such conditions as the court shall determine.
7 If the child is placed on probation in a county having a juvenile
8 bureau, the court may impose a probation fee of not more than
9 Twenty-five Dollars ($25.00) per month, if the court finds that the
10 child or parent or legal guardian of the child has the ability to
11 pay the fee. In counties having a juvenile bureau, the fee shall be
12 paid to the juvenile bureau; in all other counties, no fee shall be
13 paid to the Office of Juvenile Affairs;
14 2. If it is consistent with the welfare of the child, the child
15 shall be placed with the parent or legal guardian of the child, but
16 if it appears to the court that the conduct of such parent,
17 guardian, legal guardian, stepparent or other adult person living in
18 the home has contributed to the child becoming delinquent or in need
19 of supervision, the court may issue a written order specifying
20 conduct to be followed by such parent, guardian, legal custodian,
21 stepparent or other adult person living in the home with respect to
22 such child. The conduct specified shall be such as would reasonably
23 prevent the child from continuing to be delinquent or in need of
24 supervision.
Req. No. 11025 Page 2

1 a. If it is consistent with the welfare of the child, in
2 cases where the child has been adjudicated to be in
3 need of supervision due to repeated absence from
4 school, the court may order counseling and treatment
5 for the child and the parents of the child to be
6 provided by the local school district, the county, the
7 Office or a private individual or entity. Prior to
8 final disposition, the court shall require that it be
9 shown by the appropriate school district that a child
10 found to be truant has been evaluated for learning
11 disabilities, hearing and visual impairments and other
12 impediments which could constitute an educational
13 handicap or has been evaluated to determine whether
14 the child has a disability if it is suspected that the
15 child may require special education services in
16 accordance with the Individuals with Disabilities
17 Education Act (IDEA). The results of such tests shall
18 be made available to the court for use by the court in
19 determining the disposition of the case.
20 b. In issuing orders to a parent, guardian, legal
21 guardian, stepparent or other adult person living in
22 the home of a child adjudicated to be a delinquent
23 child or in making other disposition of said
24 delinquent child, the court may consider the testimony
Req. No. 11025 Page 3

1 of said parent, guardian, legal guardian, stepparent
2 or other adult person concerning the behavior of the
3 juvenile and the ability of such person to exercise
4 parental control over the behavior of the juvenile.
5 c. In any dispositional order involving a child age
6 sixteen (16) or older, the court shall make a
7 determination, where appropriate, of the services
8 needed to assist the child to make the transition to
9 independent living.
10 d. No child who has been adjudicated in need of
11 supervision only upon the basis of truancy or
12 noncompliance with the mandatory school attendance law
13 shall be placed in a public or private institutional
14 facility or be removed from the custody of the lawful
15 parent, guardian or custodian of the child.
16 e. Nothing in the Oklahoma Juvenile Code or the Oklahoma
17 Children's Code may be construed to prevent a child
18 from being adjudicated both deprived and delinquent if
19 there exists a factual basis for such a finding;
20 3. The court may commit the child to the custody of a private
21 institution or agency, including any institution established and
22 operated by the county, authorized to care for children or to place
23 them in family homes. In committing a child to a private
24 institution or agency, the court shall select one that is licensed
Req. No. 11025 Page 4

1 by a ny state department supervising or licensing private
2 institutions and agencies; or, if such institution or agency is in
3 another state, by the analogous department of that state. Whenever
4 the court shall commit a child to any institution or agency, it
5 shall transmit with the order of commitment a summary of its
6 information concerning the child, and such institution or agency
7 shall give to the court such information concerning the child as the
8 court may at any time require;
9 4. The court may order the child to receive counseling or other
10 community-based services as necessary;
11 5. The court may commit the child to the custody of the Office
12 of Juvenile Affairs. Any order adjudicating the child to be
13 delinquent and committing the child to the Office of Juvenile
14 Affairs shall be for an indeterminate period of time;
15 6. If the child has been placed outside the home, and it
16 appears to the court that the parent, guardian, legal custodian, or
17 stepparent, or other adult person living in the home has contributed
18 to the child becoming delinquent or in need of supervision, the
19 court may order that the parent, guardian, legal custodian,
20 stepparent, or other adult living in the home be made subject to any
21 treatment or placement plan prescribed by the Office or other person
22 or agency receiving custody of the child;
23 7. With respect to a child adjudicated a delinquent child, the
24 court may:
Req. No. 11025 Page 5

1 a. for acts involving criminally injurious conduct as
2 defined in Section 142.3 of Title 21 of the Oklahoma
3 Statutes, order the child to pay a victim compensation
4 assessment in an amount not to exceed that amount
5 specified in Section 142.18 of Title 21 of the
6 Oklahoma Statutes. The court shall forward a copy of
7 the adjudication order to the Crime Victims
8 Compensation Board for purposes of Section 142.11 of
9 Title 21 of the Oklahoma Statutes. Except as
10 otherwise provided by law, such adjudication order
11 shall be kept confidential by the Board,
12 b. order the child to engage in a term of community
13 service without compensation. The state or any
14 political subdivision shall not be liable if a loss or
15 claim results from any acts or omission of a child
16 ordered to engage in a term of community service
17 pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph,
18 c. order the child, the parent or parents of the child,
19 legal guardian of the child, or both the child and the
20 parent or parents of the child or legal guardian at
21 the time of the delinquent act of the child to make
22 full or partial restitution to the victim of the
23 offense which resulted in property damage or personal
24 injury.
Req. No. 11025 Page 6

1 (1) The court shall notify the victim of the
2 dispositional hearing. The court may consider a
3 verified statement from the victim concerning
4 damages for injury or loss of property and actual
5 expenses of medical treatment for personal
6 injury, excluding pain and suffering. If
7 contested, a restitution hearing to determine the
8 liability of the child, the parent or parents of
9 the child, or legal guardian shall be held not
10 later than thirty (30) days after the disposition
11 hearing and may be extended by the court for good
12 cause. The parent or parents of the child or
13 legal guardian may be represented by an attorney
14 in the matter of the order for remittance of the
15 restitution by the parent or parents of the child
16 or legal guardian. The burden of proving that
17 the amount indicated on the verified statement is
18 not fair and reasonable shall be on the person
19 challenging the fairness and reasonableness of
20 the amount.
21 (2) Restitution may consist of monetary reimbursement
22 for the damage or injury in the form of a lump
23 sum or installment payments after the
24 consideration of the court of the nature of the
Req. No. 11025 Page 7

1 offense, the age, physical and mental condition
2 of the child, the earning capacity of the child,
3 the parent or parents of the child, or legal
4 guardian, or the ability to pay, as the case may
5 be. The payments shall be made to such official
6 designated by the court for distribution to the
7 victim. The court may also consider any other
8 hardship on the child, the parent or parents of
9 the child, or legal guardian and, if consistent
10 with the welfare of the child, require community
11 service in lieu of restitution or require both
12 community service and full or partial restitution
13 for the acts of delinquency by the child.
14 (3) A child who is required to pay restitution and
15 who is not in willful default of the payment of
16 restitution may at any time request the court to
17 modify the method of payment. If the court
18 determines that payment under the order will
19 impose a manifest hardship on the child, the
20 parent or parents of the child, or legal
21 guardian, the court may modify the method of
22 payment.
23 (4) If the restitution is not being paid as ordered,
24 the official designated by the court to collect
Req. No. 11025 Page 8

1 and disburse the restitution ordered shall file a
2 written report of the violation with the court.
3 The report shall include a statement of the
4 amount of the arrearage and any reasons for the
5 arrearage that are known by the official. A copy
6 of the report shall be provided to all parties
7 and the court shall promptly take any action
8 necessary to compel compliance.
9 (5) Upon the juvenile attaining eighteen (18) years
10 of age, the court shall determine whether the
11 restitution order has been satisfied. If the
12 restitution order has not been satisfied, the
13 court shall enter a judgment of restitution in
14 favor of each person entitled to restitution for
15 the unpaid balance of any restitution ordered
16 pursuant to this subparagraph. The clerk of the
17 court shall send a copy of the judgment of
18 restitution to each person who is entitled to
19 restitution. The judgment shall be a lien
20 against all property of the individual or
21 individuals ordered to pay restitution and may be
22 enforced by the victim or any other person or
23 entity named in the judgment to receive
24 restitution in the same manner as enforcing
Req. No. 11025 Page 9

1 monetary judgments. The restitution judgment
2 does not expire until paid in full and is deemed
3 to be a criminal penalty for the purposes of a
4 federal bankruptcy involving the child,
5 d. order the child to pay the fine which would have been
6 imposed had such child been convicted of such crime as
7 an adult. Any such fine collected pursuant to this
8 paragraph shall be deposited in a special Work

10 allow children otherwise unable to pay restitution to
11 work in community service projects in the private or
12 public sector to earn money to compensate their

7 its jurisdiction at any time for good cause shown; and
8 10. In any dispositional order removing a child from the home
9 of the child, the court shall, in addition to the findings required
10 by Section 2-2-105 of this title, make a determination that, in
11 accordance with the best interests of the child and the protection
12 of the public, reasonable efforts have been made to provide for the
13 return of the child to the home of the child, or that efforts to
14 reunite the family are not required as provided in Section 2-2-105
15 of this title, and reasonable efforts are being made to finalize an
16 alternate permanent placement for the child.
17 B. Prior to adjudication or as directed by a law enforcement
18 subpoena or court order, a school district may disclose educational
19 records to the court or juvenile justice system for purposes of
20 determining the ability of the juvenile justice system to
21 effectively serve a child. Any disclosure of educational records
22 shall be in accordance with the requirements of the Family
23 Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA). If the parent,
24 guardian, or custodian of a child adjudicated a delinquent child
Req. No. 11025 Page 11

1 asse rts that the child has approval not to attend school pursuant to
2 Section 10-105 of Title 70 of the Oklahoma Statutes, the court or

5 school administrator of the school district where the child attends
6 school and the parent, guardian, or custodian of the child.
7 C. With respect to a child adjudicated a delinquent child for a
8 violent offense, within thirty (30) days of the date of the
9 adjudication either the juvenile bureau in counties which have a
10 juvenile bureau or the Office of Juvenile Affairs in all other
11 counties shall notify the superintendent of the school district in
12 which the child is enrolled or intends to enroll of the delinquency
13 adjudication and the offense for which the child was adjudicated.
14 D. No child who has been adjudicated in need of supervision may
15 be placed in a secure facility.
16 E. No child charged in a state or municipal court with a
17 violation of state or municipal traffic laws or ordinances, or
18 convicted therefor, may be incarcerated in jail for the violation
19 unless the charge for which the arrest was made would constitute a
20 felony if the child were an adult. Nothing contained in this
21 subsection shall prohibit the detention of a juvenile for traffic-
22 related offenses prior to the filing of a petition in the district
23 court alleging delinquency as a result of the acts and nothing
24
Req. No. 11025 Page 12

1 cont ained in this section shall prohibit detaining a juvenile

20 cases;
21 5. If the child is placed in secure detention, bail may be
22 allowed pending appeal; and
23 6. The court shall not enter an order removing the child from
24 the custody of a parent or legal guardian pursuant to this section
Req. No. 11025 Page 13

1 unle ss the court first finds that reasonable efforts have been made
2 to maintain the family unit and prevent the unnecessary removal of
3 the child from the home of the child or that an emergency exists
4 which threatens the safety of the child and that:
5 a. such removal is necessary to protect the public,
6 b. the child is likely to sustain harm if not immediately
7 removed from the home,
8 c. allowing the child to remain in the home is contrary
9 to the welfare of the child, or
10 d. immediate placement of the child is in the best
11 interests of the child.
12 The court shall state in the record that such considerations
13 have been made. Nothing in this section shall be interpreted to
14 limit the authority or discretion of the agency providing probation
15 supervision services to modify the terms of probation including, but
16 not limited to, curfews, imposing community service, or any
17 nondetention consequences.
18 G. A willful violation of any provision of an order of the
19 court issued under the provisions of the Oklahoma Juvenile Code
20 shall constitute indirect contempt of court and shall be punishable
21 by a fine not to exceed Three Hundred Dollars ($300.00) or, as to a
22 delinquent child, placement in a juvenile detention center for not
23 more than ten (10) days, or by both such fine and detention.
