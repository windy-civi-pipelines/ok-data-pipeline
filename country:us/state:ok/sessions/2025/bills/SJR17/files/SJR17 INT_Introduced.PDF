would bring at a fair voluntary sale;
2
3
2. Real property shall not be assessed for ad valorem taxation
3
4
at a value less than eleven percent (11%) nor greater than thirteen

5
and one-half percent (13.5%) of its fair cash value, as provided for

which such property was actually used, or was previously classified
7
8
for use, during the calendar year next preceding the first day of
8
9
January on which the assessment is made. The transfer of property
9

reassessment based exclusively upon the sale value of such property.
11
12
In connection with the foregoing, the Legislature shall be empowered
12
13
to enact laws defining classifications of use for the purpose of
13
14
applying standards to facilitate uniform assessment procedures in
14
15
this state; and
15
16
3. All other property which is assessed by the State Board of
16
17
Equalization shall be assessed for ad valorem taxation at the
17
18
percentage of its fair cash value, estimated at the price it would
18
19
bring at a fair voluntary sale, at which it was assessed on January
19
20
1, 1996.
20
21
B. Beginning January 1, 1997, the percentage at which real or
21
22
tangible personal property is assessed within a county shall not be
22
23
increased except upon approval by a majority of the registered
23
24
voters of the county, voting at an election called for that purpose

by a majority of the county commissioners, or upon a petition

initiated by not less than ten percent (10%) of the registered

3
voters of the county based on the total number of votes cast at the
3
4
last general election for the county office receiving the highest

5
6
be increased by more than one percentage point per year or increase

in excess of the limitations set forth in paragraphs 1 and 2 of

8
subsection A of this section. The percentage at which real or

performance of the duties of the office, shall be deemed guilty of
15
16
malfeasance, and upon conviction thereof shall forfeit the office
16
17
and be otherwise punished as may be provided by law.

22
23
January 1, 2013 for tax years 2013 through 2025, the fair cash value
23
24
of any parcel of locally assessed real property shall not increase

changed, or conveyed to another person, the property shall be
15
16
assessed for that year based on the fair cash value as set forth in

17
Section 8 of Article X of this Constitution. If any improvements
17
18
are made to the property, the increased value to the property as a
18
19
result of the improvement shall be assessed for that year based on
19
20
the fair cash value as set forth in Section 8 of Article X of this
20
21
Constitution. The provisions of this section shall not apply to any
21
22
personal property which may be taxed ad valorem or any property

which may be valued or assessed by the State Board of Equalization.
