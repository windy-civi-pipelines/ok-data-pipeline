fraction, the numerator of which is the direct

16
which reinsurance is accepted bears to the sum of
16
17

19
20
allocation in paragraph 4 of this subsection, being that which is
20
21
derived from a unitary business enterprise, shall be apportioned to
21
22

5
6
other property used in the unitary enterprise. Deductions used in
6
7
computing such net income or loss shall not include taxes based on

for purposes of the tax imposed by Section 2355 of this title has an
9
10
initial investment cost equaling or exceeding Two Hundred Million
10
11
Dollars ($200,000,000.00) and such investment is made on or after
11
12
July 1, 1997, or for corporations which expand their property or

13
facilities in this state and such expansion has an investment cost
13
14
equaling or exceeding Two Hundred Million Dollars ($200,000,000.00)

15
over a period not to exceed three (3) years, and such expansion is
15
16
commenced on or after January 1, 2000, the three factors shall be
16
17
apportioned with property and payroll, each comprising twenty-five
17
18
percent (25%) of the apportionment factor and sales comprising fifty
18
19
percent (50%) of the apportionment factor. The apportionment
19
20
factors shall be computed as follows:
20
21
a. The property factor is a fraction, the numerator of
21
22
which is the average value of the taxpayer’s real and
22
23
tangible personal property owned or rented and used in
23
24
this state during the tax period and the denominator
24
Req. No. 1572 Page 12

1
of which is the average value of all the taxpayer’s
1
2
real and tangible personal property everywhere owned
2
3
or rented and used during the tax period.
3
4
(1) Property, the income from which is separately
4
5
allocated in paragraph 4 of this subsection,
5
6
shall not be included in determining this
6
7
fraction. The numerator of the fraction shall
7
8
include a portion of the investment in
8
9
transportation and other equipment having no
9
10
fixed situs, such as rolling stock, buses, trucks
10
11
and trailers, including machinery and equipment
11
12
carried thereon, airplanes, salespersons’
12
13
automobiles and other similar equipment, in the
13
14
proportion that miles traveled in Oklahoma this
14
15
state by such equipment bears to total miles
15
16
traveled,
16
17
(2) Property owned by the taxpayer is valued at its
17
18
original cost. Property rented by the taxpayer
18
19
is valued at eight times the net annual rental
19
20
rate. Net annual rental rate is the annual
20
21
rental rate paid by the taxpayer, less any annual
21
22
rental rate received by the taxpayer from
22
23
subrentals,
23
24
24
Req. No. 1572 Page 13

(3) The average value of property shall be determined
1
2
by averaging the values at the beginning and
2
3
ending of the tax period but the Oklahoma Tax
3
4
Commission may require the averaging of monthly
4
5
values during the tax period if reasonably
5
6
required to reflect properly the average value of
6
7
the taxpayer’s property;
7
8
b. The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of
8
9
which is the total compensation for services rendered
9
10
in the state during the tax period, and the
10
11
denominator of which is the total compensation for
11
12
services rendered everywhere during the tax period.
12
13
“Compensation”, as used in this subsection, means
13
14
those paid-for services to the extent related to the
14
15
unitary business but does not include officers’
15
16
salaries, wages and other compensation.
16
17
(1) In the case of a transportation enterprise, the
17
18
numerator of the fraction shall include a portion
18
19
of such expenditure in connection with employees
19
20
operating equipment over a fixed route, such as
20
21
railroad employees, airline pilots, or bus
21
22
drivers, in this state only a part of the time,
22
23
in the proportion that mileage traveled in
23
24
24
Req. No. 1572 Page 14

1
Oklahoma this state bears to total mileage
1
2
traveled by such employees,
2
3
(2) In any case the numerator of the fraction shall
3
4
include a portion of such expenditures in
4
5
connection with itinerant employees, such as
5
6
traveling salespersons, in this state only a part
6
7
of the time, in the proportion that time spent in
7
8
Oklahoma this state bears to total time spent in
8
9
furtherance of the enterprise by such employees;
9
10
c. The sales factor is a fraction, the numerator of which
10
11
is the total sales or gross revenue of the taxpayer in
11
12
this state during the tax period, and the denominator
12
13
of which is the total sales or gross revenue of the
13
14
taxpayer everywhere during the tax period. “Sales”,
14
15
as used in this subsection, does not include sales or
15
16
gross revenue which are separately allocated in
16
17
paragraph 4 of this subsection.
17
18
(1) Sales of tangible personal property have a situs
18
19
in this state if the property is delivered or
19
20
shipped to a purchaser other than the United
20
21
States government, within this state regardless
21
22
of the FOB Freight on Board (FOB) point or other
22
23
conditions of the sale; or the property is
23
24
shipped from an office, store, warehouse, factory
24

or other place of storage in this state and (a)
1
2
the purchaser is the United States government or
2
3
(b) the taxpayer is not doing business in the
3
4
state of the destination of the shipment.
4
5
(2) In the case of a railroad or interurban railway
5
6
enterprise, the numerator of the fraction shall
6
7
not be less than the allocation of revenues to
7
8
this state as shown in its annual report to the
8
9
Corporation Commission.
9
10
(3) In the case of an airline, truck or bus
10

prescribed in this paragraph attributes to Oklahoma this state a
5
6
portion of net income of the enterprise out of all appropriate
6
7
proportion to the property owned and/or business transacted within
7
8
this state, because of the fact that one or more of the factors so
8
9
prescribed are not employed to any appreciable extent in furtherance
9
10
of the enterprise; or because one or more factors not so prescribed
10
11
are employed to a considerable extent in furtherance of the

12
enterprise; or because of other reasons, the Tax Commission is
12
13

14
portion of net income has been attributed to Oklahoma this state, or

require, when in its judgment an insufficient portion of net income
15
16
has been attributed to Oklahoma this state, the elimination,
16
17
substitution, or use of additional factors, or reduction or increase
17
18
in the weight of such prescribed factors. Provided, however, that
18
19
any such variance from such prescribed factors which has the effect
19
20
of increasing the portion of net income attributable to Oklahoma
20
21
this state must not be inherently arbitrary, and application of the
21
22
recomputed final apportionment to the net income of the enterprise
22
23
must attribute to Oklahoma this state only a reasonable portion
23
24
thereof.
