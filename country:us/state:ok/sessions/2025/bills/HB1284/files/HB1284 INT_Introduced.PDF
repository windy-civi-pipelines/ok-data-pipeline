18 suspended out-of-school in accordance with the provisions of this
19 section. Each school district board of education shall adopt a

11 this section. The policy shall specify whether appeals for short-
12 term suspensions as provided in this subsection shall be to a local
13 committee composed of district administrators or teachers or both,
14 or to the district board of education. Upon full investigation of
15 the matter, the committee or board shall determine the guilt or
16 innocence of the student and the reasonableness of the term of the
17 out-of-school suspension. If the policy requires appeals for short-
18 term suspensions to a committee, the policy adopted by the board
19 may, but is not required to, provide for appeal of the committee's
20 decision to the board.
21 2. Students suspended out-of-school for more than ten (10) days
22 and students suspended pursuant to the provisions of paragraph 2 of

5 extend beyond the current semester and the succeeding semester.
6 Upon full investigation of the matter, the board shall determine the
7 guilt or innocence of the student and the reasonableness of the term
8 of the out-of-school suspension. A board of education may conduct
9 the hearing and render the final decision or may appoint a hearing
