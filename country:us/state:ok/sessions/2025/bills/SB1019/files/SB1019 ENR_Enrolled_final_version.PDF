BILL NO. 1019 By: Thompson of the Senate
and
Stinson of the House
An Act relating to health insurance; defining terms;
requiring coverage of certain anesthesia services;
providing for codification; and providing an
effective date.
SUBJECT: Anesthesia coverage
BE IT ENACTED BY THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF OKLAHOMA:
SECTION 1. NEW LAW A new section of law to be codified
in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 7500 of Title 36, unless there
is created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:
A. As used in this section:
1. “Anesthesia time” means the period beginning when an
anesthesia practitioner begins to prepare the patient for anesthesia
services in the operating room or an equivalent area and ends when
the anesthesia practitioner is no longer furnishing anesthesia
services to the patient. In counting anesthesia time for services
furnished, the anesthesia practitioner may include blocks of time
around an interruption in anesthesia time provided the anesthesia
practitioner is furnishing continuous anesthesia care within the
time periods around the interruption;
2. “Payments for anesthesia service” means the prevailing
medical coding and billing standards in the professional medical
billing community including, but not limited to, current AMA CPT
Codebook, Medicare Claims Processing Manual, and American Society of

Anesthesiologists guidance. Payment for anesthesia services is
based on base plus time unit together multiplied by an anesthesia
conversion factor. Anesthesia time units are recognized in
appropriate time intervals that must add up to the duration of the
anesthesia time; and
3. “Insurer” shall have the same meaning as defined in Section
1250.2 of Title 36 of the Oklahoma Statutes.
B. No insurer shall establish, implement, or enforce any
policy, practice, or procedure which:
1. Imposes a time limit on the amount of covered anesthesia
services provided during a medical or surgical procedure; or
2. Restricts or excludes coverage or payment of anesthesia
time.
SECTION 2. This act shall become effective November 1, 2025.
