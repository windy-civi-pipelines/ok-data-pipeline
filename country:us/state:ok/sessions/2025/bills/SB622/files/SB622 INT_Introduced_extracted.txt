public body of which the request was made.
8
9

Section 6:
3. A public body that discloses records in accordance with
9
10
advice of the Attorney General is immune from all liabilities by
10
11
reason thereof and shall not be liable for penalties under this act.
11
12
H. If the requester files suit under Section 24A.17 of Title 51

18
19
public bodies regarding compliance with this act. A review may be

20
initiated upon receipt of a written request from the head of the
20
21
public body or its attorney, which shall contain sufficient,
21
22
accurate facts from which a determination can be made. The Public
22
23
Access Counselor may request additional information from the public
23
24
body in order to assist in the review. A public body that relies in
24
Req. No. 902 Page 4
1
good faith on the advice of the Attorney General in responding to a
1
2
request is not liable for penalties under this act if the facts upon

3
4
the Public Access Counselor.

F. Upon receipt of a request for review, the Public Access
4
5
Counselor shall determine whether further action is warranted. If
5
6
the Public Access Counselor determines that the alleged violation is
6
7
unfounded, they shall advise the requester and the public body, and
7
8
no further action shall be undertaken. In all other cases, the
8
9
Public Access Counselor shall forward a copy of the request for
9
10
review to the public body within seven (7) business days after
10
11
receipt and shall specify the records or other documents that the
11
12
public body shall furnish to facilitate the review. Within seven
12
13
(7) business days after receipt of the request for review, the
13
14
public body shall fully cooperate and provide a written response to
14
15
the Public Access Counselor. To the extent that records or
15
16
documents produced by a public body contain information claimed to
16
17
be confidential or exempt from disclosure under the Oklahoma Open
17
18
Records Act, the Public Access Counselor shall not further disclose
18
19
that information.
19
20
G. 1. The Attorney General shall examine the request and
20
21
response and shall issue to the public body or public official, or
21
22
both, an advisement in response to the request for review within
22
23
sixty (60) calendar days after its receipt. Additionally, the
23
24
24
Req. No. 902 Page 3

1
Attorney General shall notify the requester when the office has
1
2
completed its review.
2
3
2. Upon receipt of an advisement, the public body shall either
3
4
take necessary action promptly and reasonably to comply with the
4
5
Oklahoma Open Records Act or shall respond to the requester. If the
5
6
advisement concludes that no additional response is required, the
6
7
requester may file suit in the proper district court against the
7
8
public body of which the request was made.
8
9
3. A public body that discloses records in accordance with
9
10
advice of the Attorney General is immune from all liabilities by
10
11
reason thereof and shall not be liable for penalties under this act.
11
12
H. If the requester files suit under Section 24A.17 of Title 51
12
13
of the Oklahoma Statutes with respect to the same denial that is the
13
14
subject of a pending request for review, the requester shall notify
14
15
the Public Access Counselor, and the Public Access Counselor shall
15
16
take no further action with respect to the request for review and
16
17
shall so notify the public body.
17
18
I. The Attorney General may issue advisory opinions to advise
18
19
public bodies regarding compliance with this act. A review may be
19
20
initiated upon receipt of a written request from the head of the
20
21
public body or its attorney, which shall contain sufficient,
21
22
accurate facts from which a determination can be made. The Public
22
23
Access Counselor may request additional information from the public
23
24
body in order to assist in the review. A public body that relies in
24
Req. No. 902 Page 4

1
good faith on the advice of the Attorney General in responding to a
1
2
request is not liable for penalties under this act if the facts upon
2
3
which the advice is based have been fully and fairly disclosed to
3
4
the Public Access Counselor.
4
5
J. If the Public Access Counselor finds that a person
5
6
requesting review of an agency’s action pursuant to subsection B, C,
6
7
or D of this section has submitted multiple frivolous requests, the
7
8
Public Access Counselor may deny future requests for review.
8
9
K. Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, the Attorney
9
10
General shall not be required to produce pursuant to Section 24A.5
10
11

17
General in carrying out the duties required by this section.
17
18
L. Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the
18
19
Attorney General from enforcing or taking action regarding the
19
20
Oklahoma Open Records Act.
