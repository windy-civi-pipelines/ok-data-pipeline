Section 37. A. If all correctional facilities reach maximum
capacity and the Department of Corrections is required to contract
for bed space to house state inmates:
1. The Pardon and Parole Board shall consider all nonviolent
offenders for parole who are within six (6) months of their
scheduled release from a penal facility; and
2. Prior to contracting with a private prison operator to
provide housing for state inmates, the Department shall send
notification to all county jails in this state that bed space is
required to house the overflow population of state inmates. Upon
receiving notification, the sheriff or jail trust administrator of a
county jail is authorized to enter into agreements with the
Department to provide housing for the inmates. Reimbursement for
ENR. H. B. NO. 2105 Page 42

the cost of housing the inmates shall be a negotiated per diem rate
for each inmate as contracted but shall in no event be less than the
per diem rate provided for in Section 38 of this title.
B. No inmate may be received by a penal facility from a county
jail without first scheduling a transfer with the Department.
Within five (5) business days after the court orders the judgment
and sentence, the court clerk shall transmit to the Department by
facsimile, electronic mail, or actual delivery a certified copy of
the judgment and sentence.
C. The receipt of the certified copy of the judgment and
sentence shall be certification that the sentencing court has
entered a judgment and sentence and all other necessary commitment
documents. The Department of Corrections is authorized to determine
the appropriate method of delivery from each county based on
electronic or other capabilities, and establish a method for issuing
receipts certifying that the Department has received the judgment
and sentence document. The Department shall establish a dedicated
electronic address location for receipt of all electronically
submitted judgment and sentence documents. The electronic address
location shall provide written receipt verification of each received
judgment and sentence document. Once an appropriate judgment and
sentence document is received by the Department of Corrections, the
Department shall contact the sheriff or jail trust administrator
when bed space is available to schedule the transfer and reception
of the inmate into the Department.
D. If the Department receives a judgment and sentence document
from a county that includes inaccurate information from the
sentencing court the Department shall notify the county within a
timely manner. If the Department receives a judgment and sentence
document from a county that is missing the classification level of
the felony crime, the Department shall default to the lowest
possible classification level for that offense. If the Department
receives a judgment and sentence document from a county that is
missing the required amount of the minimum time to be served, the
Department shall default to the lowest possible amount of the
minimum time to be served for that offense.
E. When a county jail has reached its capacity of inmates as
provided in the standards set forth in Section 192 of Title 74 of
the Oklahoma Statutes, then the county sheriff or jail trust
administrator shall notify the Director of the Oklahoma Department
of Corrections, or the Director's designated representative, by
ENR. H. B. NO. 2105 Page 43

facsimile, electronic mail, or actual delivery, that the county jail
has reached or exceeded its capacity to hold inmates. The
notification shall include copies of any judgment and sentences not
previously delivered as required by subsection B of this section.
Then within seventy-two (72) hours following such notification, the
county sheriff or jail trust administrator shall transport the
designated excess inmate or inmates to a penal facility designated
by the Department. The sheriff or jail trust administrator shall
notify the Department of the transport of the inmate prior to the
reception of the inmate. The Department shall schedule the
reception date and receive the inmate within seventy-two (72) hours
of notification that the county jail is at capacity, unless other
arrangements can be made with the sheriff or jail trust
administrator.
F. The Department will be responsible for the cost of housing
the inmate in the county jail including costs of medical care
provided from the date the judgment and sentence was ordered by the
court until the date of transfer of the inmate from the county jail.
The Department shall implement a policy for determination of
scheduled dates on which an inmate or multiple inmates are to be
transferred from county jails. The policy shall allow for no less
than three alternative dates from which the sheriff or jail trust
administrator of a county jail may select and shall provide for
weather-related occurrences or other emergencies that may prevent or
delay transfers on the scheduled date. The policy shall be
available for review upon request by any sheriff or jail trust
administrator of a county jail. The cost of housing shall be the
per diem rate specified in Section 38 of this title. In the event
the inmate has one or more criminal charges pending in the same
Oklahoma jurisdiction and the county jail refuses to transfer the
inmate to the Department because of the pending charges, the
Department shall not be responsible for the housing costs of the
inmate while the inmate remains in the county jail with pending
charges. Once the inmate no longer has pending charges in the
jurisdiction, the Department shall be responsible for the housing
costs of the inmate for the period beginning on the date the
judgment and sentence or final order was ordered by the Court. In
the event the inmate has other criminal charges pending in another
Oklahoma jurisdiction, the Department shall be responsible for the
housing costs while the inmate remains in the county jail awaiting
transfer to another jurisdiction or until the date the inmate is
scheduled to be transferred to the Department, whichever is earlier.
Once the inmate is transferred to another jurisdiction, the
Department is not responsible for the housing cost of the inmate
ENR. H. B. NO. 2105 Page 44

until such time that another judgment and sentence is received by
the Department from another Oklahoma jurisdiction.
The sheriff or jail trust administrator may submit invoices for
the cost of housing the inmate on a monthly basis. Final payment
for housing an offender will be made only after the official
judgment and sentence is received by the Department of Corrections.
