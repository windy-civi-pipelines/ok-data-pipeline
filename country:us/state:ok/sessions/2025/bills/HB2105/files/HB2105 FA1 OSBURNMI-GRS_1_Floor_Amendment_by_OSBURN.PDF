Reading Clerk

"SECTION 8. AMENDATORY 22 O.S. 2021, Section 977, is amended
to read as follows:
Section 977. A. When judgment upon a conviction is rendered, the
clerk must enter the same upon the minutes, stating briefly the offense
for which the conviction has been had, and must immediately annex together
and file the following papers, which constitute a record of the action:
1. The indictment and a copy of the minutes of the plea or demurrer;
2. A copy of the minutes of the trial;
3. The charges given or refused, and the endorsements, if any,
thereon; and
4. A copy of the judgment, which shall include a notation of the
month and year of birth date of the defendant and the last four digits of
the Social Security number of the defendant. The judgment shall also
contain the statutory reference, including any relevant subsections, to
the felony crime the defendant was convicted of, the classification level
of the felony crime the defendant was convicted of, the required amount of
the minimum time to be served according to the sentencing court, and the
date of the offense.
B. The court shall obtain the month and year of birth date of the
defendant and the last four digits of the Social Security number of the
defendant.
SECTION 9. AMENDATORY 57 O.S. 2021, Section 37, is amended to
read as follows:
Section 37. A. If all correctional facilities reach maximum capacity
and the Department of Corrections is required to contract for bed space to
house state inmates:
1. The Pardon and Parole Board shall consider all nonviolent
offenders for parole who are within six (6) months of their scheduled
release from a penal facility; and
2. Prior to contracting with a private prison operator to provide
housing for state inmates, the Department shall send notification to all
county jails in this state that bed space is required to house the
overflow population of state inmates. Upon receiving notification, the
sheriff or jail trust administrator of a county jail is authorized to
enter into agreements with the Department to provide housing for the
inmates. Reimbursement for the cost of housing the inmates shall be a
negotiated per diem rate for each inmate as contracted but shall in no
event be less than the per diem rate provided for in Section 38 of this
title.
B. No inmate may be received by a penal facility from a county jail
without first scheduling a transfer with the Department. Within five (5)
business days after the court orders the judgment and sentence, the court
clerk shall transmit to the Department by facsimile, electronic mail, or
actual delivery a certified copy of the judgment and sentence.
C. The receipt of the certified copy of the judgment and sentence
shall be certification that the sentencing court has entered a judgment
and sentence and all other necessary commitment documents. The Department
of Corrections is authorized to determine the appropriate method of
delivery from each county based on electronic or other capabilities, and
establish a method for issuing receipts certifying that the Department has

received the judgment and sentence document. The Department shall
establish a dedicated electronic address location for receipt of all
electronically submitted judgment and sentence documents. The electronic
address location shall provide written receipt verification of each
received judgment and sentence document. Once an appropriate judgment and
sentence document is received by the Department of Corrections, the
Department shall contact the sheriff or jail trust administrator when bed
space is available to schedule the transfer and reception of the inmate
into the Department.
D. If the Department receives a judgment and sentence document from a
county that includes inaccurate information from the sentencing court the
Department shall notify the county within a timely manner. If the
Department receives a judgment and sentence document from a county that is
missing the classification level of the felony crime, the Department shall
default to the lowest possible classification level for that offense. If
the Department receives a judgment and sentence document from a county
that is missing the required amount of the minimum time to be served, the
Department shall default to the lowest possible amount of the minimum time
to be served for that offense.
E. When a county jail has reached its capacity of inmates as provided
in the standards set forth in Section 192 of Title 74 of the Oklahoma
Statutes, then the county sheriff or jail trust administrator shall notify
the Director of the Oklahoma Department of Corrections, or the Director's
designated representative, by facsimile, electronic mail, or actual
delivery, that the county jail has reached or exceeded its capacity to
hold inmates. The notification shall include copies of any judgment and
sentences not previously delivered as required by subsection B of this
section. Then within seventy-two (72) hours following such notification,
the county sheriff or jail trust administrator shall transport the
designated excess inmate or inmates to a penal facility designated by the
Department. The sheriff or jail trust administrator shall notify the
Department of the transport of the inmate prior to the reception of the
inmate. The Department shall schedule the reception date and receive the
inmate within seventy-two (72) hours of notification that the county jail
is at capacity, unless other arrangements can be made with the sheriff or
jail trust administrator.
F. The Department will be responsible for the cost of housing the
inmate in the county jail including costs of medical care provided from
the date the judgment and sentence was ordered by the court until the date
of transfer of the inmate from the county jail. The Department shall
implement a policy for determination of scheduled dates on which an inmate
or multiple inmates are to be transferred from county jails. The policy
shall allow for no less than three alternative dates from which the
sheriff or jail trust administrator of a county jail may select and shall
provide for weather-related occurrences or other emergencies that may
prevent or delay transfers on the scheduled date. The policy shall be
available for review upon request by any sheriff or jail trust
administrator of a county jail. The cost of housing shall be the per diem
rate specified in Section 38 of this title. In the event the inmate has
one or more criminal charges pending in the same Oklahoma jurisdiction and
the county jail refuses to transfer the inmate to the Department because

of the pending charges, the Department shall not be responsible for the
housing costs of the inmate while the inmate remains in the county jail
with pending charges. Once the inmate no longer has pending charges in
the jurisdiction, the Department shall be responsible for the housing
costs of the inmate for the period beginning on the date the judgment and
sentence or final order was ordered by the Court. In the event the inmate
has other criminal charges pending in another Oklahoma jurisdiction, the
Department shall be responsible for the housing costs while the inmate
remains in the county jail awaiting transfer to another jurisdiction or
until the date the inmate is scheduled to be transferred to the
Department, whichever is earlier. Once the inmate is transferred to
another jurisdiction, the Department is not responsible for the housing
cost of the inmate until such time that another judgment and sentence is
received by the Department from another Oklahoma jurisdiction.
The sheriff or jail trust administrator may submit invoices for the
cost of housing the inmate on a monthly basis. Final payment for housing
an offender will be made only after the official judgment and sentence is
received by the Department of Corrections."
