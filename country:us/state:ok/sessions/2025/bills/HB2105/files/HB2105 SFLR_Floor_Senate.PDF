9 2. Prior to contracting with a private prison operator to
10 provide housing for state inmates, the Department shall send
11 notification to all county jails in this state that bed space is
12 required to house the overflow population of state inmates. Upon
13 receiving notification, the sheriff or jail trust administrator of a
14 county jail is authorized to enter into agreements with the
15 Department to provide housing for the inmates. Reimbursement for
16 the cost of housing the inmates shall be a negotiated per diem rate
17 for each inmate as contracted but shall in no event be less than the
18 per diem rate provided for in Section 38 of this title.
19 B. No inmate may be received by a penal facility from a county
20 jail without first scheduling a transfer with the Department.

SENATE FLOOR VERSION - HB2105 SFLR Page 63
(Bold face denotes Committee Amendments)

1 C. The receipt of the certified copy of the judgment and

7 receipts certifying that the Department has received the judgment
8 and sentence document. The Department shall establish a dedicated
9 electronic address location for receipt of all electronically
10 submitted judgment and sentence documents. The electronic address
11 location shall provide written receipt verification of each received
12 judgment and sentence document. Once an appropriate judgment and
13 sentence document is received by the Department of Corrections, the
14 Department shall contact the sheriff or jail trust administrator
15 when bed space is available to schedule the transfer and reception
16 of the inmate into the Department.
17 D. If the Department receives a judgment and sentence document
18 from a county that includes inaccurate information from the
19 sentencing court the Department shall notify the county within a
20 timely manner. If the Department receives a judgment and sentence
21 document from a county that is missing the classification level of
22 the felony crime, the Department shall default to the lowest

24 receives a judgment and sentence document from a county that is
SENATE FLOOR VERSION - HB2105 SFLR Page 64

15 designated excess inmate or inmates to a penal facility designated
16 by the Department. The sheriff or jail trust administrator shall
17 notify the Department of the transport of the inmate prior to the
18 reception of the inmate. The Department shall schedule the
19 reception date and receive the inmate within seventy-two (72) hours
20 of notification that the county jail is at capacity, unless other
21 arrangements can be made with the sheriff or jail trust
22 administrator.

3 The Department shall implement a policy for determination of
4 scheduled dates on which an inmate or multiple inmates are to be
5 transferred from county jails. The policy shall allow for no less
6 than three alternative dates from which the sheriff or jail trust
7 administrator of a county jail may select and shall provide for
8 weather-related occurrences or other emergencies that may prevent or
9 delay transfers on the scheduled date. The policy shall be
10 available for review upon request by any sheriff or jail trust
11 administrator of a county jail. The cost of housing shall be the
12 per diem rate specified in Section 38 of this title. In the event
13 the inmate has one or more criminal charges pending in the same
14 Oklahoma jurisdiction and the county jail refuses to transfer the
15 inmate to the Department because of the pending charges, the
16 Department shall not be responsible for the housing costs of the
17 inmate while the inmate remains in the county jail with pending
18 charges. Once the inmate no longer has pending charges in the
19 jurisdiction, the Department shall be responsible for the housing
20 costs of the inmate for the period beginning on the date the
21 judgment and sentence or final order was ordered by the Court. In
22 the event the inmate has other criminal charges pending in another
23 Oklahoma jurisdiction, the Department shall be responsible for the
24 housing costs while the inmate remains in the county jail awaiting

2 scheduled to be transferred to the Department, whichever is earlier.
3 Once the inmate is transferred to another jurisdiction, the
4 Department is not responsible for the housing cost of the inmate
5 until such time that another judgment and sentence is received by
6 the Department from another Oklahoma jurisdiction.
7 The sheriff or jail trust administrator may submit invoices for
8 the cost of housing the inmate on a monthly basis. Final payment
9 for housing an offender will be made only after the official
10 judgment and sentence is received by the Department of Corrections.
