7 shall be adopted by the Commission for Educational Quality and
8 Accountability for the professional education and various subject
9 areas and grade levels for purposes of ensuring academic achievement
10 and competency of each teacher candidate or teacher in the subject
11 area the person is seeking certification to teach which shall also
12 include certification as an administrator, as prescribed by the
13 State Board of Education.
14 The Commission, consistent with the purposes of this section,
15 shall promulgate rules and procedures to guarantee the
16 confidentiality of examinations.
17 B. No teacher candidate shall be eligible for certification
18 until successfully completing the competency examination except
19 those candidates who make application to the State Board and meet
20 the criteria for the alternative placement program pursuant to
21 Section 6-122.3 of this title. Certification shall be limited to
22 areas of approval in which the certified teacher has successfully

ENGR. S. B. NO. 841 Page 2

1 teac her candidate or teacher is seeking a minor teaching assignment
2 or an endorsement to teach shall be limited to the specific subject
3 area test.
4 A teacher candidate or teacher may take the professional
5 education or subject area portions of the examination subject to any
6 limit imposed by the Commission.
7 C. 1. Except as otherwise provided for in this subsection, a
8 teacher may be certified in as many areas as the teacher meets the
9 necessary requirements provided by law and has successfully
10 completed the subject area portion of the examination.
11 2. Except as otherwise provided for in this paragraph,
12 certification in early childhood, elementary, or special education
13 shall require completion of an appropriate teacher education program

18 be certified in early childhood education upon meeting the
19 requirements provided in law and successful completion of the
20 appropriate subject area portion of the examination. Any teacher
21 who is certified to teach early childhood education may be certified

20 Commission.
21 E. If a teacher candidate or teacher is a non-native-English
22 speaker, the Commission shall offer the subject area competency

2 foreign language immersion program offered by the school district.
3 If a non-native-English speaker who has received certification in a
4 subject area after taking the subject area competency examination in
5 the native language of the speaker seeks to add a certification area
6 in the future and that person is no longer employed as a teacher in
7 a foreign language immersion program, the examination for the
8 additional certification area shall be taken in English. The State
9 Board of Education shall issue a restricted license or certificate
10 to any teacher who has completed a subject area competency
11 examination in the native language of the teacher as provided for in

19 that is substantially comparable to the content assessed on a
20 subject area examination. The advanced degree shall be from an
21 institution accredited by a national or regional accrediting agency
22 which is recognized by the Secretary of the United States Department
23 of Education. The Commission shall provide the Board with the

ENGR. S. B. NO. 841 Page 5

1 G. 1. Nothing in the Oklahoma Teacher Preparation Act shall
2 restrict the right of the State Board of Education to issue an
3 emergency or provisional certificate, as needed. Provided, however,
4 prior to the issuance of an emergency certificate, the district
5 shall document substantial efforts to employ a teacher who holds a
6 provisional or standard certificate. In the event a district is
7 unable to hire an individual meeting this criteria, the district
8 shall document efforts to employ an individual with a provisional or
9 standard certificate in another curricular area with academic
10 preparation in the field of need. Only after these alternatives
11 have been exhausted shall the district be allowed to employ an
12 individual meeting minimum standards as established by the State
13 Board of Education for the issuance of emergency certificates.
14 2. The State Board of Education may renew the emergency or
15 provisional certificate of an individual who has been employed by a

19 provisional certificate pursuant to paragraph 1 of
20 this subsection for two (2) years,
21 b. the individual has not successfully completed the

10 and provides evidence of the district’s inability to
11 hire a teacher who holds a standard certificate.
12 3. Individuals employed by a school district under an emergency
13 or provisional certificate shall not be considered career teachers
14 and therefore not entitled to the protections of the Teacher Due
15 Process Act of 1990.
16 H. The State Board of Education may grant an exception to the
17 requirements for all certification examinations for teacher
18 candidates who are “deaf”, which for the purposes of this section
19 shall mean having a hearing loss so severe that the person cannot
20 process auditory linguistic information with or without
21 accommodation and whose primary language and teaching environment is
22 American Sign Language. The Board may grant an exception upon:
