17 If a non-native-English speaker who has received certification in a
18 subject area after taking the subject area competency examination in
19 the native language of the speaker seeks to add a certification area
20 in the future and that person is no longer employed as a teacher in
21 a foreign language immersion program, the examination for the
22 additional certification area shall be taken in English. The State
23 Board of Education shall issue a restricted license or certificate
24 to any teacher who has completed a subject area competency

20 provisional or standard certificate. In the event a district is
21 unable to hire an individual meeting this criteria, the district
22 shall document efforts to employ an individual with a provisional or
23 standard certificate in another curricular area with academic
24 preparation in the field of need. Only after these alternatives
Req. No. 1871 Page 5

21 emergency or provisional certificate should be renewed
22 and provides evidence of the district’s inability to
23 hire a teacher who holds a standard certificate.
24
Req. No. 1871 Page 6

1 3. Individuals employed by a school district under an emergency
2 or provisional certificate shall not be considered career teachers
