10 If a non-native-English speaker who has received certification in a
11 subject area after taking the subject area competency examination in
12 the native language of the speaker seeks to add a certification area
13 in the future and that person is no longer employed as a teacher in
14 a foreign language immersion program, the examination for the
15 additional certification area shall be taken in English. The State
16 Board of Education shall issue a restricted license or certificate

10 emergency or provisional certificate, as needed. Provided, however,
11 prior to the issuance of an emergency certificate, the district

13 provisional or standard certificate. In the event a district is
14 unable to hire an individual meeting this criteria, the district
15 shall document efforts to employ an individual with a provisional or
16 standard certificate in another curricular area with academic
17 preparation in the field of need. Only after these alternatives
18 have been exhausted shall the district be allowed to employ an
19 individual meeting minimum standards as established by the State
20 Board of Education for the issuance of emergency certificates.

15 and provides evidence of the district’s inability to
16 hire a teacher who holds a standard certificate.
17 3. Individuals employed by a school district under an emergency
18 or provisional certificate shall not be considered career teachers
19 and therefore not entitled to the protections of the Teacher Due
