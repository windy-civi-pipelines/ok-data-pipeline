provided in this section shall provide the Department with a copy of

child, other than a child in the custody of the Office of Juvenile
Affairs and placed in an Office of Juvenile Affairs secure juvenile
facility, may be abused or neglected by reason of the acts,
omissions, or failures on the part of a person responsible for the
health, safety, or welfare of the child, the law enforcement agency
