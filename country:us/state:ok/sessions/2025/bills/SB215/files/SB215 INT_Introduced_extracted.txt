there is created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:
19
20
A. Sections 1 through 8 of this act shall be known and may be
20
21
cited as the “Oklahoma Math Achievement and Proficiency Act”.
21
22
B. The Legislature finds that it is essential for children
22
23
enrolled in the public schools in this state to develop strong
23
24
mathematical skills early and consistently. The Legislature further
24
Req. No. 193 Page 3
1
finds that clear and visible goals, assessments to determine math
1
2
proficiency at each school, the use of scientifically based and
2
3
researched methodologies in math instruction, along with regular and
3
4
periodic measurements of school math improvement, and accountability
4
5
at each level of the educational system will result in a significant
5
6
increase in the number of children performing at or above grade
6
7
level in mathematics.
7
8
C. The purpose of the Oklahoma Math Achievement and Proficiency
8
9
Act is to ensure that student achievement in math is encouraged and
9
10
progression from one grade to another is determined, in part, upon
10
11
proficiency in mathematics, that school district board of education
11
12
policies facilitate promotion of advanced math instruction and
12
13
intervention services to address student math needs, and that each
13
14
student and his or her parent or legal guardian be informed of the
14
15
student’s progress in mathematics.
15
16
D. Each public school district in this state shall ensure that
16
17
all students receive a well-rounded education focused on building
17
18
deep foundations in mathematics, reading, and writing. The State
18
19
Board of Education shall encourage school districts to integrate the
19
20
teaching of the other curricular areas in subject matter standards
20
21
adopted by the Board with the instruction of mathematics, reading,
21
22
and writing.
22
23

5
6
there is created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:
6
7
A. To identify students who have a math deficiency including
7
8
students with characteristics of dyscalculia, each student enrolled
8
9

9
10
this state shall be screened at the beginning, middle, and end of
10
11
each school year for math skills including, but not limited to,
11
12
number sense, counting, operations, and mathematical reasoning. A
12
13
screening instrument approved by the State Board of Education shall
13

19
20
teachers, administrators, and parents or legal guardians of
20
21
students; and

22
23
curriculum.

11
12
language learners; and
12
13

Section 12:
5. Be accompanied by a data management system that provides
13
14
profiles of students, class, grade level, and school building. The

19
there is created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:
19
20
A. Sections 1 through 8 of this act shall be known and may be
20
21
cited as the “Oklahoma Math Achievement and Proficiency Act”.
21
22
B. The Legislature finds that it is essential for children
22
23
enrolled in the public schools in this state to develop strong
23
24
mathematical skills early and consistently. The Legislature further
24
Req. No. 193 Page 3

1
finds that clear and visible goals, assessments to determine math
1
2
proficiency at each school, the use of scientifically based and
2
3
researched methodologies in math instruction, along with regular and
3
4
periodic measurements of school math improvement, and accountability
4
5
at each level of the educational system will result in a significant

6
increase in the number of children performing at or above grade
6
7
level in mathematics.
7
8
C. The purpose of the Oklahoma Math Achievement and Proficiency
8
9
Act is to ensure that student achievement in math is encouraged and
9
10
progression from one grade to another is determined, in part, upon
10
11
proficiency in mathematics, that school district board of education
11
12
policies facilitate promotion of advanced math instruction and
12
13
intervention services to address student math needs, and that each
13
14
student and his or her parent or legal guardian be informed of the
14
15
student’s progress in mathematics.

16
D. Each public school district in this state shall ensure that
16
17
all students receive a well-rounded education focused on building
17
18
deep foundations in mathematics, reading, and writing. The State
18
19
Board of Education shall encourage school districts to integrate the
19
20
teaching of the other curricular areas in subject matter standards

there is created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:
6
7
A. To identify students who have a math deficiency including
7
8
students with characteristics of dyscalculia, each student enrolled
8
9
in fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh grade in a public school in
9
10
this state shall be screened at the beginning, middle, and end of
10
11
each school year for math skills including, but not limited to,
11
12
number sense, counting, operations, and mathematical reasoning. A
12
13
screening instrument approved by the State Board of Education shall
13
14
be utilized for the purposes of this section. In determining which
14
15
screening instrument to approve, the State Board of Education shall
15
16
take into consideration, at a minimum, the following factors:
16
17
1. The time required to conduct the screening instrument with
17
18
the intention of minimizing the impact on instructional time;
18
19
2. The timeliness in reporting screening instrument results to
19
20
teachers, administrators, and parents or legal guardians of
20
21
students; and

11
12
language learners; and
12
13
5. Be accompanied by a data management system that provides
13
14
