where applicable, of the payment of the annual corporate franchise
tax to the Tax Commission.
F. For the purposes of computing the fees to be collected by
the Secretary of State pursuant to the provisions of this section,
each share without par value shall be treated the same as a share

thousand merchants in this state. The Secretary of State shall
determine which nationally recognized credit cards will be accepted;
provided, however, the Secretary of State must ensure that no loss
of state revenue will occur by the use of such card. The
convenience fee collected pursuant to this paragraph shall be
credited to the Revolving Fund for the Office of the Secretary of
State, as established in Section 276.1 of Title 62 of the Oklahoma
Statutes.
