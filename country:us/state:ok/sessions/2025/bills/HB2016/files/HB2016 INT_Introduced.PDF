4 that the declarant may have been afforded an opportunity to deny or
5 explain. If the party against whom a hearsay statement has been
6 admitted calls the declarant as a witness, the party is entitled to
7 examine the declarant on the statement as if under cross-
8 examination.
9 B. When output of a process or system has been admitted in
10 evidence, and would be a hearsay statement if uttered by a human
11 declarant, the output's accuracy may be attacked, and, if attacked,
12 may be supported by any evidence which would be admissible for those
13 purposes if the output had been uttered by a human declarant. The
14 court may admit evidence of the process's or system's inconsistent
15 output, or prior false output where probative of the admitted
16 output's accuracy, for these purposes as well.
17 SECTION 3. This act shall become effective November 1, 2025.
