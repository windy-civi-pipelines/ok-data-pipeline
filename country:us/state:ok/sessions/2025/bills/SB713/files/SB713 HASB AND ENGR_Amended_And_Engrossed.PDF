8 A. As used in this section:
9 1. “Light-mitigating technology system” means aircraft
10 detection lighting or any other comparable system capable of
11 reducing the impact of facility obstruction lighting while
12 maintaining conspicuity sufficient to assist aircraft in identifying
13 and avoiding collision with a wind energy facility;
14 2. “Wind energy facility” means an electrical generation
15 facility consisting of one or more wind turbines under common
16 ownership or operating control, and includes substations,
17 meteorological data towers, aboveground and underground electrical
18 transmission lines, transformers, control systems, and other

24
ENGR. H. A. to ENGR. S. B. NO. 713 Page 2

1 3. “Repowering” means a rebuild or refurbishment of a majority
2 of the wind energy facility due to the facility reaching the end of
3 its useful life or useful reasonable economic life. The rebuild or
4 refurbishment does not constitute repowering if it is part of
5 routine major maintenance or the maintenance of or replacement of
6 equipment that does not materially affect the expected physical or
7 economic life of the facility; and
8 4. “Power offtake agreement” means a long-term contract that
9 provides for the provision of the whole or any part of the available
10 capacity or the sale or other disposal of the whole or any part of
11 the output of a wind energy facility. Sales of capacity or energy
12 into a capacity or power market do not constitute a power offtake
13 agreement.
14 B. On and after January 1, 2026, no new wind energy facility
15 may commence operations in this state unless the developer, owner,
16 or operator of the facility applies to the Federal Aviation

1 miti gating technology system on the facility within twenty-four (24)
2 months after receipt of approval.
3 C. 1. Any developer, owner, or operator of a wind energy
4 facility that commences commercial operations in this state on or
5 before the effective date of this act without a light-mitigating
6 technology system shall apply to the FAA for installation of the

8 Section 1.1 et seq. and to the FCC regarding frequency licensing and
9 antenna structure registration, as applicable, as provided in 47
10 C.F.R., Sections 90.101 and 17.4 upon the occurrence of either:
11 a. the repowering of the wind energy facility, or
12 b. entrance into or renewal of a new power offtake
13 agreement.
14 2. Upon approval of the application submitted to the FAA and
15 the FCC in compliance with paragraph 1 of this subsection, the
16 developer, owner, or operator of such facility shall install the
17 light-mitigating technology system on the facility within twenty-
18 four (24) months after receipt of approval.
19 D. Any county may issue revenue bonds for the purpose of paying
20 all or part of the costs of the purchase, acquisition, and equipping
21 of a light-mitigating technology system, subject to the approval of
22 the FAA and FCC, for a wind energy facility that has commenced
23 operations without a light-mitigating technology system prior to the
24 effective date of this act.
ENGR. H. A. to ENGR. S. B. NO. 713 Page 4

1 E. Any costs associated with the installation, implementation,
2 operation, and maintenance of a light-mitigating technology system

5 regulation by the Corporation Commission, costs incurred directly by
6 the public utility in compliance with this act may seek recovery
7 subject to review and order of the Corporation Commission.
8 F. Wind energy facilities shall maintain operations of
