17
18 such equipment will not be considered a violation of the Fair

6
7 different dealers with respect to purchases of equipment or repair
7
8 parts of like grade and quality and identical brand, where the
8
9 effect of such discrimination may be to substantially lessen
9
10 competition, tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce, or
10
11 injure, destroy or prevent competition with any dealer who either
11
12 grants or knowingly receives the benefit of such discrimination;
12
13 provided, however, different prices may be charged if:
13
14 a. such differences are due to differences in the cost of
14
15 manufacture, sale or delivery of the equipment or
15
16 repair parts,
16
17 b. the supplier can show that its lower price was made in
17
18 good faith to meet an equally low price of a

21
22 obtained by dealers;
