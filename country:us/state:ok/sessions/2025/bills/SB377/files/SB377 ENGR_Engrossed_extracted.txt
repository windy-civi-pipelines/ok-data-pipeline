17 SECTION 2. AMENDATORY 15 O.S. 2021, Section 245A, is
18 amended to read as follows:
19 Section 245A. It shall be a violation of the Fair Practices of
20 Equipment Manufacturers, Distributors, Wholesalers and Dealers Act
21 for a supplier to take any one or more of the following actions:
22 1. To coerce, compel or require any dealer to accept delivery
23 of any equipment or repair parts which the dealer has not
24 voluntarily ordered, except as required by any applicable law or
ENGR. S. B. NO. 377 Page 9
1 unle ss such equipment or repair parts are safety features required
2 by a supplier;
3 2. To require any dealer to purchase goods or services as a
4 condition to the sale by the supplier to the dealer of any
5 equipment, repair parts or other goods or services, provided that
6 nothing herein shall prohibit a supplier from requiring the dealer
7 to purchase all repair parts, special tools and training reasonably
8 necessary to maintain the safe operation or quality of operation in
9 the field of any equipment offered for sale by the dealer;
10 3. To coerce any dealer into a refusal to purchase equipment
11 manufactured by another supplier. However, prevent a dealer from
12 being a party to a dealer agreement or holding an investment in a
13 person that is a party to such a dealer agreement, that authorizes
14 the dealer to sell competing product lines or makes of equipment or
15 prevents a dealer from performing the dealer’s obligations under
16 such dealer agreement, or to require a dealer to provide separate
17 facilities for competing product lines or makes of equipment. If a
18 dealer purchased equipment from a supplier constituting eighty
19 percent (80%) of the dealer’s new equipment, calculated on the basis
20 of net equipment cost, at all retail sales facilities operated by
21 such dealer and the total annual sales volume of equipment acquired
22 from such supplier exceeds Forty Million Dollars ($40,000,000.00),
23 subject to adjustment after the effective date of this act on the
24 same basis as calculated in subparagraph b of paragraph 16 of
ENGR. S. B. NO. 377 Page 10
1 Sect ion 245 of this title for single-line dealers, at such retail
2 sales facilities for the five (5) calendar years immediately
3 preceding the applicable determination date, then it shall not be a
4 violation of this section to require separate facilities, financial
5 statements or sales staff for major competing lines so long as the
6 dealer is given at least three (3) years notice of such requirement
7 the extent the dealer is prevented from selling major competing
8 product lines or makes of equipment at such retail sales facilities
9 of the dealer authorized to sell new equipment acquired from the
10 supplier seeking to impose the restriction on sales of major
11 competing product lines or makes of equipment;
12 4. To refuse to deliver in reasonable quantities and within a
13 reasonable time, after receipt of the dealer’s order, to any dealer
14 having a dealer agreement for the retail sale of new equipment sold
15 or distributed by such supplier, equipment covered by such dealer
16 agreement specifically advertised or represented by such supplier to
17 be available for immediate delivery. The failure to deliver any
18 such equipment will not be considered a violation of the Fair
19 Practices of Equipment Manufacturers, Distributors, Wholesalers and
20 Dealers Act if such failure is due to prudent and reasonable
21 restrictions on extensions of credit by the supplier to the dealer,
22 an act of nature, work stoppage or delay due to a strike or labor
23 difficulty, a bona fide shortage of materials, freight embargo, or
24 other cause over which the supplier has no control or a business
ENGR. S. B. NO. 377 Page 11
1 deci sion by the supplier to limit the production volume of the
2 equipment;
3 5. To discriminate, directly or indirectly, in filling an order
4 placed by a dealer for retail sale or lease of new equipment under a
5 dealer agreement as between dealers of the same product line;
6 6. To discriminate, directly or indirectly, in price between
7 different dealers with respect to purchases of equipment or repair
8 parts of like grade and quality and identical brand, where the
9 effect of such discrimination may be to substantially lessen
10 competition, tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce, or
11 injure, destroy or prevent competition with any dealer who either
12 grants or knowingly receives the benefit of such discrimination;
13 provided, however, different prices may be charged if:
14 a. such differences are due to differences in the cost of
15 manufacture, sale or delivery of the equipment or
16 repair parts,
17 b. the supplier can show that its lower price was made in
18 good faith to meet an equally low price of a
19 competitor, or
20 c. such differences are related to the volume of
21 equipment purchased by dealers or market share
22 obtained by dealers;
23 7. To prevent by contract or otherwise, any dealer from
24 changing its capital structure or the means by or through which the
ENGR. S. B. NO. 377 Page 12
1 deal er finances its operations, so long as the dealer gives prior
2 notice to the supplier, and provided the dealer at all times meets
3 any reasonable capital standards required by the supplier pursuant
4 to a right granted in the dealer agreement and imposed on similarly
5 situated dealers; and
6 8. To require a dealer to assent to a release, assignment,
7 novation, waiver, or estoppel which would relieve any person from
8 liability imposed by this act the Fair Practices of Equipment
9 Manufacturers, Distributors, Wholesalers and Dealers Act.

13 thirty (30) days days’ prior written notice of termination. No
14 supplier may terminate a dealer agreement without good cause.

16 Equipment Manufacturers, Distributors, Wholesalers and Dealers Act,
17 “good cause” means the failure by a dealer to substantially comply
18 with essential and reasonable requirements imposed upon the dealer
19 by the dealer agreement, provided such requirements are not
20 different from those requirements imposed on other similarly
21 situated dealers either by their terms or in the manner of their
22 enforcement. In addition, good cause shall exist whenever:
23 1. The dealer or dealership has transferred a controlling
24 ownership interest in its business without the supplier’s consent
ENGR. S. B. NO. 377 Page 13
1 unle ss the supplier does not have the right to withhold consent
2 under either the dealer agreement or under the terms of this act;
3 2. The dealer has filed a voluntary petition in bankruptcy or
4 has had an involuntary petition in bankruptcy filed against it which
5 has not been discharged within thirty (30) days after the filing, or
6 there has been a closeout or sale of a substantial part of the
7 dealer’s assets related to the business, or there has been a
8 commencement of dissolution or liquidation of the dealer;
9 3. There has been a deletion, addition or change in dealer or
10 dealership locations without the prior written approval of the
11 supplier;
12 4. The dealer has defaulted under any chattel mortgage or other
13 security agreement between the dealer and the supplier, or there has
14 been a revocation of any guarantee of the dealer’s present or future
15 obligations to the supplier; provided, however, good cause will not
16 exist if a person revokes any guarantee in connection with or
17 following the transfer of such person’s entire ownership interest in
18 the dealer unless the supplier requires the person to execute a new
19 guarantee of the dealer’s present or future obligations in
20 connection with the transfer of ownership interest;
21 5. The dealer has failed to operate in the normal course of
22 business for seven (7) consecutive days or has otherwise abandoned
23 its business;

5 the representation or reputation of the supplier’s product; or
6 8. The dealer has consistently failed to meet and maintain the
7 supplier’s requirements for reasonable standards and performance
8 objectives, so long as the supplier has given the dealer reasonable
9 standards and performance objectives that are based on the
10 manufacturer’s experience in other comparable market areas.
11 B. The provisions of this section will not apply to single-line
12 dealer agreements.
13 SECTION 4. AMENDATORY 15 O.S. 2021, Section 245A.2, is
14 amended to read as follows:
15 Section 245A.2. A. Except as otherwise provided in this
16 section, a supplier must provide a dealer at least one hundred
17 eighty (180) days days’ prior written notice of termination of a
18 dealer agreement. The notice must state all reasons constituting
19 good cause for such termination and must state that the dealer has
20 sixty (60) days in which to cure any claimed deficiency. If the
21 deficiency is rectified within sixty (60) days, the notice will be
22 void. A supplier, other than a specialty agricultural equipment
23 supplier, may not terminate a dealer agreement for the reason set
24 forth in paragraph 8 of subsection A of Section 5 245A.1 of this act
ENGR. S. B. NO. 377 Page 15
1 titl e unless the supplier gives the dealer notice of such action at
2 least two (2) years before the effective date of the action. If the
3 dealer achieves the supplier’s requirements for reasonable standards
4 or performance objectives before the expiration of the two-year
5 notice period, the notice will be void and the dealer agreement will
6 continue in full force and effect. The notice and right to cure

10 B. If a supplier has contractual authority to approve or deny a
11 request for a sale or transfer of a dealer’s business or an equity
12 ownership interest therein, the supplier shall approve or deny such
13 a request within sixty (60) days after receiving a written request
14 from the dealer. If the supplier has neither approved nor denied
15 the request within the sixty-day period, the request will be deemed
16 approved. The dealer’s request shall include reasonable financial,
17 personal background, character references and work history
18 information for the acquiring persons. If a supplier denies a
19 request made pursuant to this subsection, the supplier must provide
20 the dealer with a written notice of the denial that states the
21 reasons for the denial. A supplier may only deny not unreasonably
22 withhold consent to a request based on the failure of the proposed
23 transferees to meet the reasonable requirements consistently imposed
24 by the supplier in determining approval of the transfer and/or
ENGR. S. B. NO. 377 Page 16
1 appr ovals of new dealers for a sale or transfer of a dealer’s
2 business or an equity ownership interest in such business, and such
3 consent may only be withheld for good cause. The supplier shall
4 have the burden to prove that the denial of the request for sale or
5 transfer complied with the requirements of this subsection.
6 C. If a dealer dies and the supplier has contractual authority
7 to approve or deny a request for a sale or transfer of the dealer’s
8 business or equity ownership interest therein, the dealer’s estate,
9 or such other person with authority to transfer assets of the
10 dealer, will have one hundred eighty (180) days to submit to the
11 supplier a written request for a sale or transfer of the business or
12 equity ownership interest. If the request is timely submitted, the
13 supplier shall approve or deny the request in accordance with
14 subsection B of this section. Notwithstanding anything to the
15 contrary contained in the Fair Practices of Equipment Manufacturers,
16 Distributors, Wholesalers and Dealers Act, any attempt by the
17 supplier to terminate the dealer or the dealership as a result of
18 the death of a dealer will be delayed until there has been
19 compliance with the terms of this section or the one-hundred-eighty-
20 day period has expired, as applicable.
21 D. The provisions of this section shall not apply to single-
22 line dealer agreements.
23 SECTION 5. This act shall become effective November 1, 2025.

17 SECTION 2. AMENDATORY 15 O.S. 2021, Section 245A, is
18 amended to read as follows:
19 Section 245A. It shall be a violation of the Fair Practices of
20 Equipment Manufacturers, Distributors, Wholesalers and Dealers Act
21 for a supplier to take any one or more of the following actions:
22 1. To coerce, compel or require any dealer to accept delivery
23 of any equipment or repair parts which the dealer has not
24 voluntarily ordered, except as required by any applicable law or
ENGR. S. B. NO. 377 Page 9

1 unle ss such equipment or repair parts are safety features required
2 by a supplier;
3 2. To require any dealer to purchase goods or services as a
4 condition to the sale by the supplier to the dealer of any
5 equipment, repair parts or other goods or services, provided that
6 nothing herein shall prohibit a supplier from requiring the dealer
7 to purchase all repair parts, special tools and training reasonably
8 necessary to maintain the safe operation or quality of operation in
9 the field of any equipment offered for sale by the dealer;
10 3. To coerce any dealer into a refusal to purchase equipment
11 manufactured by another supplier. However, prevent a dealer from
12 being a party to a dealer agreement or holding an investment in a
13 person that is a party to such a dealer agreement, that authorizes
14 the dealer to sell competing product lines or makes of equipment or
15 prevents a dealer from performing the dealer’s obligations under
16 such dealer agreement, or to require a dealer to provide separate
17 facilities for competing product lines or makes of equipment. If a
18 dealer purchased equipment from a supplier constituting eighty
19 percent (80%) of the dealer’s new equipment, calculated on the basis
20 of net equipment cost, at all retail sales facilities operated by
21 such dealer and the total annual sales volume of equipment acquired
22 from such supplier exceeds Forty Million Dollars ($40,000,000.00),
23 subject to adjustment after the effective date of this act on the
24 same basis as calculated in subparagraph b of paragraph 16 of
ENGR. S. B. NO. 377 Page 10

1 Sect ion 245 of this title for single-line dealers, at such retail
2 sales facilities for the five (5) calendar years immediately
3 preceding the applicable determination date, then it shall not be a
4 violation of this section to require separate facilities, financial
5 statements or sales staff for major competing lines so long as the
6 dealer is given at least three (3) years notice of such requirement
7 the extent the dealer is prevented from selling major competing
8 product lines or makes of equipment at such retail sales facilities
9 of the dealer authorized to sell new equipment acquired from the
10 supplier seeking to impose the restriction on sales of major
11 competing product lines or makes of equipment;
12 4. To refuse to deliver in reasonable quantities and within a
13 reasonable time, after receipt of the dealer’s order, to any dealer
14 having a dealer agreement for the retail sale of new equipment sold
15 or distributed by such supplier, equipment covered by such dealer
16 agreement specifically advertised or represented by such supplier to
17 be available for immediate delivery. The failure to deliver any
18 such equipment will not be considered a violation of the Fair
19 Practices of Equipment Manufacturers, Distributors, Wholesalers and
20 Dealers Act if such failure is due to prudent and reasonable
21 restrictions on extensions of credit by the supplier to the dealer,
22 an act of nature, work stoppage or delay due to a strike or labor
23 difficulty, a bona fide shortage of materials, freight embargo, or
24 other cause over which the supplier has no control or a business
ENGR. S. B. NO. 377 Page 11

1 deci sion by the supplier to limit the production volume of the
2 equipment;
3 5. To discriminate, directly or indirectly, in filling an order
4 placed by a dealer for retail sale or lease of new equipment under a
5 dealer agreement as between dealers of the same product line;
6 6. To discriminate, directly or indirectly, in price between
7 different dealers with respect to purchases of equipment or repair
8 parts of like grade and quality and identical brand, where the
9 effect of such discrimination may be to substantially lessen
10 competition, tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce, or
11 injure, destroy or prevent competition with any dealer who either
12 grants or knowingly receives the benefit of such discrimination;
13 provided, however, different prices may be charged if:
14 a. such differences are due to differences in the cost of
15 manufacture, sale or delivery of the equipment or
16 repair parts,
17 b. the supplier can show that its lower price was made in
18 good faith to meet an equally low price of a
19 competitor, or
20 c. such differences are related to the volume of
21 equipment purchased by dealers or market share
22 obtained by dealers;
23 7. To prevent by contract or otherwise, any dealer from
24 changing its capital structure or the means by or through which the
ENGR. S. B. NO. 377 Page 12

1 deal er finances its operations, so long as the dealer gives prior
2 notice to the supplier, and provided the dealer at all times meets
3 any reasonable capital standards required by the supplier pursuant
4 to a right granted in the dealer agreement and imposed on similarly
5 situated dealers; and
6 8. To require a dealer to assent to a release, assignment,
7 novation, waiver, or estoppel which would relieve any person from
8 liability imposed by this act the Fair Practices of Equipment
9 Manufacturers, Distributors, Wholesalers and Dealers Act.

16 Equipment Manufacturers, Distributors, Wholesalers and Dealers Act,
17 “good cause” means the failure by a dealer to substantially comply
18 with essential and reasonable requirements imposed upon the dealer
19 by the dealer agreement, provided such requirements are not
20 different from those requirements imposed on other similarly
21 situated dealers either by their terms or in the manner of their
22 enforcement. In addition, good cause shall exist whenever:
23 1. The dealer or dealership has transferred a controlling
24 ownership interest in its business without the supplier’s consent
ENGR. S. B. NO. 377 Page 13

1 unle ss the supplier does not have the right to withhold consent
2 under either the dealer agreement or under the terms of this act;
3 2. The dealer has filed a voluntary petition in bankruptcy or
4 has had an involuntary petition in bankruptcy filed against it which
5 has not been discharged within thirty (30) days after the filing, or
6 there has been a closeout or sale of a substantial part of the
7 dealer’s assets related to the business, or there has been a
8 commencement of dissolution or liquidation of the dealer;
9 3. There has been a deletion, addition or change in dealer or
10 dealership locations without the prior written approval of the
11 supplier;
12 4. The dealer has defaulted under any chattel mortgage or other
13 security agreement between the dealer and the supplier, or there has
14 been a revocation of any guarantee of the dealer’s present or future
15 obligations to the supplier; provided, however, good cause will not
16 exist if a person revokes any guarantee in connection with or
17 following the transfer of such person’s entire ownership interest in
18 the dealer unless the supplier requires the person to execute a new
19 guarantee of the dealer’s present or future obligations in
20 connection with the transfer of ownership interest;
21 5. The dealer has failed to operate in the normal course of
22 business for seven (7) consecutive days or has otherwise abandoned
23 its business;
24
ENGR. S. B. NO. 377 Page 14

2 felony affecting the relationship between the dealer and supplier;
3 7. The dealer has engaged in conduct which is injurious or
4 detrimental to the dealer’s customers or to the public welfare or
5 the representation or reputation of the supplier’s product; or
6 8. The dealer has consistently failed to meet and maintain the
7 supplier’s requirements for reasonable standards and performance
8 objectives, so long as the supplier has given the dealer reasonable
9 standards and performance objectives that are based on the
10 manufacturer’s experience in other comparable market areas.
11 B. The provisions of this section will not apply to single-line
12 dealer agreements.
13 SECTION 4. AMENDATORY 15 O.S. 2021, Section 245A.2, is
14 amended to read as follows:
15 Section 245A.2. A. Except as otherwise provided in this
16 section, a supplier must provide a dealer at least one hundred
17 eighty (180) days days’ prior written notice of termination of a
18 dealer agreement. The notice must state all reasons constituting
19 good cause for such termination and must state that the dealer has
20 sixty (60) days in which to cure any claimed deficiency. If the
21 deficiency is rectified within sixty (60) days, the notice will be
22 void. A supplier, other than a specialty agricultural equipment
23 supplier, may not terminate a dealer agreement for the reason set
24 forth in paragraph 8 of subsection A of Section 5 245A.1 of this act
ENGR. S. B. NO. 377 Page 15

1 titl e unless the supplier gives the dealer notice of such action at
2 least two (2) years before the effective date of the action. If the
3 dealer achieves the supplier’s requirements for reasonable standards
4 or performance objectives before the expiration of the two-year
5 notice period, the notice will be void and the dealer agreement will
6 continue in full force and effect. The notice and right to cure
7 provisions under this section shall not apply if the reason for
8 termination is for any reason set forth in paragraphs 1 through 7 of
9 subsection A of Section 5 245A.1 of this act title.
10 B. If a supplier has contractual authority to approve or deny a
11 request for a sale or transfer of a dealer’s business or an equity
12 ownership interest therein, the supplier shall approve or deny such
13 a request within sixty (60) days after receiving a written request
14 from the dealer. If the supplier has neither approved nor denied
15 the request within the sixty-day period, the request will be deemed
16 approved. The dealer’s request shall include reasonable financial,
17 personal background, character references and work history
18 information for the acquiring persons. If a supplier denies a
19 request made pursuant to this subsection, the supplier must provide
20 the dealer with a written notice of the denial that states the
21 reasons for the denial. A supplier may only deny not unreasonably
22 withhold consent to a request based on the failure of the proposed
23 transferees to meet the reasonable requirements consistently imposed
24 by the supplier in determining approval of the transfer and/or
ENGR. S. B. NO. 377 Page 16

1 appr ovals of new dealers for a sale or transfer of a dealer’s
2 business or an equity ownership interest in such business, and such
3 consent may only be withheld for good cause. The supplier shall
4 have the burden to prove that the denial of the request for sale or
5 transfer complied with the requirements of this subsection.
6 C. If a dealer dies and the supplier has contractual authority

9 or such other person with authority to transfer assets of the
10 dealer, will have one hundred eighty (180) days to submit to the
11 supplier a written request for a sale or transfer of the business or
12 equity ownership interest. If the request is timely submitted, the
13 supplier shall approve or deny the request in accordance with
14 subsection B of this section. Notwithstanding anything to the
15 contrary contained in the Fair Practices of Equipment Manufacturers,
16 Distributors, Wholesalers and Dealers Act, any attempt by the
17 supplier to terminate the dealer or the dealership as a result of
18 the death of a dealer will be delayed until there has been
19 compliance with the terms of this section or the one-hundred-eighty-
20 day period has expired, as applicable.
21 D. The provisions of this section shall not apply to single-
22 line dealer agreements.
23 SECTION 5. This act shall become effective November 1, 2025.
