Section 29:
SECTION 2. AMENDATORY 15 O.S. 2021, Section 245A, is
amended to read as follows:

Section 30:
Section 245A. It shall be a violation of the Fair Practices of
Equipment Manufacturers, Distributors, Wholesalers and Dealers Act
for a supplier to take any one or more of the following actions:

Section 31:
1. To coerce, compel or require any dealer to accept delivery
of any equipment or repair parts which the dealer has not
voluntarily ordered, except as required by any applicable law or
unless such equipment or repair parts are safety features required
by a supplier;

Section 32:
2. To require any dealer to purchase goods or services as a
condition to the sale by the supplier to the dealer of any
equipment, repair parts or other goods or services, provided that
nothing herein shall prohibit a supplier from requiring the dealer
to purchase all repair parts, special tools and training reasonably
necessary to maintain the safe operation or quality of operation in
the field of any equipment offered for sale by the dealer;

Section 33:
3. To coerce any dealer into a refusal to purchase equipment
manufactured by another supplier. However, prevent a dealer from
being a party to a dealer agreement or holding an investment in a
person that is a party to such a dealer agreement, that authorizes
the dealer to sell competing product lines or makes of equipment or
prevents a dealer from performing the dealer’s obligations under
such dealer agreement, or to require a dealer to provide separate
facilities for competing product lines or makes of equipment. If a
ENR. S. B. NO. 377 Page 7
dealer purchased equipment from a supplier constituting eighty
percent (80%) of the dealer’s new equipment, calculated on the basis
of net equipment cost, at all retail sales facilities operated by
such dealer and the total annual sales volume of equipment acquired
from such supplier exceeds Forty Million Dollars ($40,000,000.00),
subject to adjustment after the effective date of this act on the
same basis as calculated in subparagraph b of paragraph 16 of

Section 34:
Section 245 of this title for single-line dealers, at such retail
sales facilities for the five (5) calendar years immediately
preceding the applicable determination date, then it shall not be a
violation of this section to require separate facilities, financial
statements or sales staff for major competing lines so long as the
dealer is given at least three (3) years notice of such requirement
the extent the dealer is prevented from selling major competing
product lines or makes of equipment at such retail sales facilities
of the dealer authorized to sell new equipment acquired from the
supplier seeking to impose the restriction on sales of major
competing product lines or makes of equipment;

Section 35:
4. To refuse to deliver in reasonable quantities and within a
reasonable time, after receipt of the dealer’s order, to any dealer
having a dealer agreement for the retail sale of new equipment sold
or distributed by such supplier, equipment covered by such dealer
agreement specifically advertised or represented by such supplier to
be available for immediate delivery. The failure to deliver any
such equipment will not be considered a violation of the Fair
Practices of Equipment Manufacturers, Distributors, Wholesalers and
Dealers Act if such failure is due to prudent and reasonable
restrictions on extensions of credit by the supplier to the dealer,
an act of nature, work stoppage or delay due to a strike or labor
difficulty, a bona fide shortage of materials, freight embargo, or
other cause over which the supplier has no control or a business
decision by the supplier to limit the production volume of the
equipment;

Section 36:
5. To discriminate, directly or indirectly, in filling an order
placed by a dealer for retail sale or lease of new equipment under a
dealer agreement as between dealers of the same product line;

Section 37:
6. To discriminate, directly or indirectly, in price between
different dealers with respect to purchases of equipment or repair
parts of like grade and quality and identical brand, where the
ENR. S. B. NO. 377 Page 8
effect of such discrimination may be to substantially lessen
competition, tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce, or
injure, destroy or prevent competition with any dealer who either
grants or knowingly receives the benefit of such discrimination;
provided, however, different prices may be charged if:
a. such differences are due to differences in the cost of
manufacture, sale or delivery of the equipment or
repair parts,
b. the supplier can show that its lower price was made in
good faith to meet an equally low price of a
competitor, or
c. such differences are related to the volume of
equipment purchased by dealers or market share
obtained by dealers;

Section 38:
7. To prevent by contract or otherwise, any dealer from
changing its capital structure or the means by or through which the
dealer finances its operations, so long as the dealer gives prior
notice to the supplier, and provided the dealer at all times meets
any reasonable capital standards required by the supplier pursuant
to a right granted in the dealer agreement and imposed on similarly
situated dealers; and

Section 39:
8. To require a dealer to assent to a release, assignment,
novation, waiver, or estoppel which would relieve any person from
liability imposed by this act the Fair Practices of Equipment
Manufacturers, Distributors, Wholesalers and Dealers Act.

Section 40:
SECTION 3. AMENDATORY 15 O.S. 2021, Section 245A.1, is
amended to read as follows:

Section 41:
Section 245A.1. A. The dealer must give the supplier at least
thirty (30) days days’ prior written notice of termination. No
supplier may terminate a dealer agreement without good cause.
Except as otherwise specifically provided in the Fair Practices of
Equipment Manufacturers, Distributors, Wholesalers and Dealers Act,
“good cause” means the failure by a dealer to substantially comply
with essential and reasonable requirements imposed upon the dealer
by the dealer agreement, provided such requirements are not
ENR. S. B. NO. 377 Page 9
different from those requirements imposed on other similarly
situated dealers either by their terms or in the manner of their
enforcement. In addition, good cause shall exist whenever:

Section 42:
1. The dealer or dealership has transferred a controlling
ownership interest in its business without the supplier’s consent
unless the supplier does not have the right to withhold consent
under either the dealer agreement or under the terms of this act;

Section 43:
2. The dealer has filed a voluntary petition in bankruptcy or
has had an involuntary petition in bankruptcy filed against it which
has not been discharged within thirty (30) days after the filing, or
there has been a closeout or sale of a substantial part of the
dealer’s assets related to the business, or there has been a
commencement of dissolution or liquidation of the dealer;

Section 44:
3. There has been a deletion, addition or change in dealer or
dealership locations without the prior written approval of the
supplier;

Section 45:
4. The dealer has defaulted under any chattel mortgage or other
security agreement between the dealer and the supplier, or there has
been a revocation of any guarantee of the dealer’s present or future
obligations to the supplier; provided, however, good cause will not
exist if a person revokes any guarantee in connection with or
following the transfer of such person’s entire ownership interest in
the dealer unless the supplier requires the person to execute a new
guarantee of the dealer’s present or future obligations in
connection with the transfer of ownership interest;

Section 46:
5. The dealer has failed to operate in the normal course of
business for seven (7) consecutive days or has otherwise abandoned
its business;

Section 47:
6. The dealer has pleaded guilty to or has been convicted of a
felony affecting the relationship between the dealer and supplier;

Section 48:
7. The dealer has engaged in conduct which is injurious or
detrimental to the dealer’s customers or to the public welfare or
the representation or reputation of the supplier’s product; or
ENR. S. B. NO. 377 Page 10

Section 49:
8. The dealer has consistently failed to meet and maintain the
supplier’s requirements for reasonable standards and performance
objectives, so long as the supplier has given the dealer reasonable
standards and performance objectives that are based on the
manufacturer’s experience in other comparable market areas.
B. The provisions of this section will not apply to single-line
dealer agreements.

Section 50:
SECTION 4. AMENDATORY 15 O.S. 2021, Section 245A.2, is
amended to read as follows:

Section 51:
Section 245A.2. A. Except as otherwise provided in this

Section 52:
section, a supplier must provide a dealer at least one hundred
eighty (180) days days’ prior written notice of termination of a
dealer agreement. The notice must state all reasons constituting
good cause for such termination and must state that the dealer has
sixty (60) days in which to cure any claimed deficiency. If the
deficiency is rectified within sixty (60) days, the notice will be
void. A supplier, other than a specialty agricultural equipment
supplier, may not terminate a dealer agreement for the reason set
forth in paragraph 8 of subsection A of Section 5 245A.1 of this act
title unless the supplier gives the dealer notice of such action at
least two (2) years before the effective date of the action. If the
dealer achieves the supplier’s requirements for reasonable standards
or performance objectives before the expiration of the two-year
notice period, the notice will be void and the dealer agreement will
continue in full force and effect. The notice and right to cure
provisions under this section shall not apply if the reason for
termination is for any reason set forth in paragraphs 1 through 7 of
subsection A of Section 5 245A.1 of this act title.
B. If a supplier has contractual authority to approve or deny a
request for a sale or transfer of a dealer’s business or an equity
ownership interest therein, the supplier shall approve or deny such
a request within sixty (60) days after receiving a written request
from the dealer. If the supplier has neither approved nor denied
the request within the sixty-day period, the request will be deemed
approved. The dealer’s request shall include reasonable financial,
personal background, character references and work history
information for the acquiring persons. If a supplier denies a
request made pursuant to this subsection, the supplier must provide
ENR. S. B. NO. 377 Page 11
the dealer with a written notice of the denial that states the
reasons for the denial. A supplier may only deny not unreasonably
withhold consent to a request based on the failure of the proposed
transferees to meet the reasonable requirements consistently imposed
by the supplier in determining approval of the transfer and/or
approvals of new dealers for a sale or transfer of a dealer’s
business or an equity ownership interest in such business, and such
consent may only be withheld for good cause. The supplier shall
have the burden to prove that the denial of the request for sale or
transfer complied with the requirements of this subsection.
C. If a dealer dies and the supplier has contractual authority
to approve or deny a request for a sale or transfer of the dealer’s
business or equity ownership interest therein, the dealer’s estate,
or such other person with authority to transfer assets of the
dealer, will have one hundred eighty (180) days to submit to the
supplier a written request for a sale or transfer of the business or
equity ownership interest. If the request is timely submitted, the
supplier shall approve or deny the request in accordance with
subsection B of this section. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in the Fair Practices of Equipment Manufacturers,
Distributors, Wholesalers and Dealers Act, any attempt by the
supplier to terminate the dealer or the dealership as a result of
the death of a dealer will be delayed until there has been
compliance with the terms of this section or the one-hundred-eighty-
day period has expired, as applicable.
D. The provisions of this section shall not apply to single-
line dealer agreements.

Section 53:
SECTION 5. This act shall become effective November 1, 2025.

SECTION 2. AMENDATORY 15 O.S. 2021, Section 245A, is
amended to read as follows:
Section 245A. It shall be a violation of the Fair Practices of
Equipment Manufacturers, Distributors, Wholesalers and Dealers Act
for a supplier to take any one or more of the following actions:
1. To coerce, compel or require any dealer to accept delivery
of any equipment or repair parts which the dealer has not
voluntarily ordered, except as required by any applicable law or
unless such equipment or repair parts are safety features required
by a supplier;
2. To require any dealer to purchase goods or services as a
condition to the sale by the supplier to the dealer of any
equipment, repair parts or other goods or services, provided that
nothing herein shall prohibit a supplier from requiring the dealer
to purchase all repair parts, special tools and training reasonably
necessary to maintain the safe operation or quality of operation in
the field of any equipment offered for sale by the dealer;
3. To coerce any dealer into a refusal to purchase equipment
manufactured by another supplier. However, prevent a dealer from
being a party to a dealer agreement or holding an investment in a
person that is a party to such a dealer agreement, that authorizes
the dealer to sell competing product lines or makes of equipment or
prevents a dealer from performing the dealer’s obligations under
such dealer agreement, or to require a dealer to provide separate
facilities for competing product lines or makes of equipment. If a
ENR. S. B. NO. 377 Page 7

dealer purchased equipment from a supplier constituting eighty
percent (80%) of the dealer’s new equipment, calculated on the basis
of net equipment cost, at all retail sales facilities operated by
such dealer and the total annual sales volume of equipment acquired
from such supplier exceeds Forty Million Dollars ($40,000,000.00),
subject to adjustment after the effective date of this act on the
same basis as calculated in subparagraph b of paragraph 16 of
Section 245 of this title for single-line dealers, at such retail
sales facilities for the five (5) calendar years immediately
preceding the applicable determination date, then it shall not be a
violation of this section to require separate facilities, financial
statements or sales staff for major competing lines so long as the
dealer is given at least three (3) years notice of such requirement
the extent the dealer is prevented from selling major competing
product lines or makes of equipment at such retail sales facilities
of the dealer authorized to sell new equipment acquired from the
supplier seeking to impose the restriction on sales of major
competing product lines or makes of equipment;
4. To refuse to deliver in reasonable quantities and within a
reasonable time, after receipt of the dealer’s order, to any dealer
having a dealer agreement for the retail sale of new equipment sold
or distributed by such supplier, equipment covered by such dealer
agreement specifically advertised or represented by such supplier to
be available for immediate delivery. The failure to deliver any
such equipment will not be considered a violation of the Fair
Practices of Equipment Manufacturers, Distributors, Wholesalers and
Dealers Act if such failure is due to prudent and reasonable
restrictions on extensions of credit by the supplier to the dealer,
an act of nature, work stoppage or delay due to a strike or labor
difficulty, a bona fide shortage of materials, freight embargo, or
other cause over which the supplier has no control or a business
decision by the supplier to limit the production volume of the
equipment;
5. To discriminate, directly or indirectly, in filling an order
placed by a dealer for retail sale or lease of new equipment under a
dealer agreement as between dealers of the same product line;
6. To discriminate, directly or indirectly, in price between
different dealers with respect to purchases of equipment or repair
parts of like grade and quality and identical brand, where the
ENR. S. B. NO. 377 Page 8

effect of such discrimination may be to substantially lessen
competition, tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce, or
injure, destroy or prevent competition with any dealer who either
grants or knowingly receives the benefit of such discrimination;
provided, however, different prices may be charged if:
a. such differences are due to differences in the cost of
manufacture, sale or delivery of the equipment or
repair parts,
b. the supplier can show that its lower price was made in
good faith to meet an equally low price of a
competitor, or
c. such differences are related to the volume of
equipment purchased by dealers or market share
obtained by dealers;
7. To prevent by contract or otherwise, any dealer from
changing its capital structure or the means by or through which the
dealer finances its operations, so long as the dealer gives prior
notice to the supplier, and provided the dealer at all times meets
any reasonable capital standards required by the supplier pursuant
to a right granted in the dealer agreement and imposed on similarly
situated dealers; and
8. To require a dealer to assent to a release, assignment,
novation, waiver, or estoppel which would relieve any person from
liability imposed by this act the Fair Practices of Equipment
Manufacturers, Distributors, Wholesalers and Dealers Act.
SECTION 3. AMENDATORY 15 O.S. 2021, Section 245A.1, is
amended to read as follows:
Section 245A.1. A. The dealer must give the supplier at least
thirty (30) days days’ prior written notice of termination. No
supplier may terminate a dealer agreement without good cause.
Except as otherwise specifically provided in the Fair Practices of
Equipment Manufacturers, Distributors, Wholesalers and Dealers Act,
“good cause” means the failure by a dealer to substantially comply
with essential and reasonable requirements imposed upon the dealer
by the dealer agreement, provided such requirements are not
ENR. S. B. NO. 377 Page 9

different from those requirements imposed on other similarly
situated dealers either by their terms or in the manner of their
enforcement. In addition, good cause shall exist whenever:
1. The dealer or dealership has transferred a controlling
ownership interest in its business without the supplier’s consent
unless the supplier does not have the right to withhold consent
under either the dealer agreement or under the terms of this act;
2. The dealer has filed a voluntary petition in bankruptcy or
has had an involuntary petition in bankruptcy filed against it which
has not been discharged within thirty (30) days after the filing, or
there has been a closeout or sale of a substantial part of the
dealer’s assets related to the business, or there has been a
commencement of dissolution or liquidation of the dealer;
3. There has been a deletion, addition or change in dealer or
dealership locations without the prior written approval of the
supplier;
4. The dealer has defaulted under any chattel mortgage or other
security agreement between the dealer and the supplier, or there has
been a revocation of any guarantee of the dealer’s present or future
obligations to the supplier; provided, however, good cause will not
exist if a person revokes any guarantee in connection with or
following the transfer of such person’s entire ownership interest in
the dealer unless the supplier requires the person to execute a new
guarantee of the dealer’s present or future obligations in
connection with the transfer of ownership interest;
5. The dealer has failed to operate in the normal course of
business for seven (7) consecutive days or has otherwise abandoned
its business;
6. The dealer has pleaded guilty to or has been convicted of a
felony affecting the relationship between the dealer and supplier;
7. The dealer has engaged in conduct which is injurious or
detrimental to the dealer’s customers or to the public welfare or
the representation or reputation of the supplier’s product; or
ENR. S. B. NO. 377 Page 10

8. The dealer has consistently failed to meet and maintain the
supplier’s requirements for reasonable standards and performance
objectives, so long as the supplier has given the dealer reasonable
standards and performance objectives that are based on the
manufacturer’s experience in other comparable market areas.
B. The provisions of this section will not apply to single-line
dealer agreements.
SECTION 4. AMENDATORY 15 O.S. 2021, Section 245A.2, is
amended to read as follows:
Section 245A.2. A. Except as otherwise provided in this
section, a supplier must provide a dealer at least one hundred
eighty (180) days days’ prior written notice of termination of a
dealer agreement. The notice must state all reasons constituting
good cause for such termination and must state that the dealer has
sixty (60) days in which to cure any claimed deficiency. If the
deficiency is rectified within sixty (60) days, the notice will be
void. A supplier, other than a specialty agricultural equipment
supplier, may not terminate a dealer agreement for the reason set
forth in paragraph 8 of subsection A of Section 5 245A.1 of this act
title unless the supplier gives the dealer notice of such action at
least two (2) years before the effective date of the action. If the
dealer achieves the supplier’s requirements for reasonable standards
or performance objectives before the expiration of the two-year
notice period, the notice will be void and the dealer agreement will
continue in full force and effect. The notice and right to cure
provisions under this section shall not apply if the reason for
termination is for any reason set forth in paragraphs 1 through 7 of
subsection A of Section 5 245A.1 of this act title.
B. If a supplier has contractual authority to approve or deny a
request for a sale or transfer of a dealer’s business or an equity
ownership interest therein, the supplier shall approve or deny such
a request within sixty (60) days after receiving a written request
from the dealer. If the supplier has neither approved nor denied
the request within the sixty-day period, the request will be deemed
approved. The dealer’s request shall include reasonable financial,
personal background, character references and work history
information for the acquiring persons. If a supplier denies a
request made pursuant to this subsection, the supplier must provide
ENR. S. B. NO. 377 Page 11

the dealer with a written notice of the denial that states the
reasons for the denial. A supplier may only deny not unreasonably
withhold consent to a request based on the failure of the proposed
transferees to meet the reasonable requirements consistently imposed
by the supplier in determining approval of the transfer and/or
approvals of new dealers for a sale or transfer of a dealer’s
business or an equity ownership interest in such business, and such
consent may only be withheld for good cause. The supplier shall
have the burden to prove that the denial of the request for sale or
transfer complied with the requirements of this subsection.
C. If a dealer dies and the supplier has contractual authority
to approve or deny a request for a sale or transfer of the dealer’s
business or equity ownership interest therein, the dealer’s estate,
or such other person with authority to transfer assets of the
dealer, will have one hundred eighty (180) days to submit to the
supplier a written request for a sale or transfer of the business or
equity ownership interest. If the request is timely submitted, the
supplier shall approve or deny the request in accordance with
subsection B of this section. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in the Fair Practices of Equipment Manufacturers,
Distributors, Wholesalers and Dealers Act, any attempt by the
supplier to terminate the dealer or the dealership as a result of
the death of a dealer will be delayed until there has been
compliance with the terms of this section or the one-hundred-eighty-
day period has expired, as applicable.
D. The provisions of this section shall not apply to single-
line dealer agreements.
SECTION 5. This act shall become effective November 1, 2025.
