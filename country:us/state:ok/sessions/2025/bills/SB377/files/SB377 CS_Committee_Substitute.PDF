22 Equipment Manufacturers, Distributors, Wholesalers and Dealers Act
23 for a supplier to take any one or more of the following actions:
24
Req. No. 1703 Page 9

1 1. To coerce, compel or require any dealer to accept delivery
2 of any equipment or repair parts which the dealer has not
3 voluntarily ordered, except as required by any applicable law or
4 unless such equipment or repair parts are safety features required
5 by a supplier;
6 2. To require any dealer to purchase goods or services as a
7 condition to the sale by the supplier to the dealer of any
8 equipment, repair parts or other goods or services, provided that
9 nothing herein shall prohibit a supplier from requiring the dealer
10 to purchase all repair parts, special tools and training reasonably
11 necessary to maintain the safe operation or quality of operation in
12 the field of any equipment offered for sale by the dealer;
13 3. To coerce any dealer into a refusal to purchase equipment
14 manufactured by another supplier. However, prevent a dealer from
15 being a party to a dealer agreement or holding an investment in a
16 person that is a party to such a dealer agreement, that authorizes
17 the dealer to sell competing product lines or makes of equipment or
18 prevents a dealer from performing the dealer’s obligations under
19 such dealer agreement, or to require a dealer to provide separate
20 facilities for competing product lines or makes of equipment. If a
21 dealer purchased equipment from a supplier constituting eighty
22 percent (80%) of the dealer’s new equipment, calculated on the basis
23 of net equipment cost, at all retail sales facilities operated by
24 such dealer and the total annual sales volume of equipment acquired
Req. No. 1703 Page 10

1 from such supplier exceeds Forty Million Dollars ($40,000,000.00),
2 subject to adjustment after the effective date of this act on the
3 same basis as calculated in subparagraph b of paragraph 16 of
4 Section 245 of this title for single-line dealers, at such retail
5 sales facilities for the five (5) calendar years immediately
6 preceding the applicable determination date, then it shall not be a
7 violation of this section to require separate facilities, financial
8 statements or sales staff for major competing lines so long as the
9 dealer is given at least three (3) years notice of such requirement
10 the extent the dealer is prevented from selling major competing
11 product lines or makes of equipment at such retail sales facilities
12 of the dealer authorized to sell new equipment acquired from the
13 supplier seeking to impose the restriction on sales of major
14 competing product lines or makes of equipment;
15 4. To refuse to deliver in reasonable quantities and within a
16 reasonable time, after receipt of the dealer’s order, to any dealer
17 having a dealer agreement for the retail sale of new equipment sold
18 or distributed by such supplier, equipment covered by such dealer
19 agreement specifically advertised or represented by such supplier to
20 be available for immediate delivery. The failure to deliver any
21 such equipment will not be considered a violation of the Fair
22 Practices of Equipment Manufacturers, Distributors, Wholesalers and
23 Dealers Act if such failure is due to prudent and reasonable
24 restrictions on extensions of credit by the supplier to the dealer,
Req. No. 1703 Page 11

1 an a ct of nature, work stoppage or delay due to a strike or labor
2 difficulty, a bona fide shortage of materials, freight embargo, or
3 other cause over which the supplier has no control or a business
4 decision by the supplier to limit the production volume of the
5 equipment;
6 5. To discriminate, directly or indirectly, in filling an order
7 placed by a dealer for retail sale or lease of new equipment under a
8 dealer agreement as between dealers of the same product line;
9 6. To discriminate, directly or indirectly, in price between
10 different dealers with respect to purchases of equipment or repair
11 parts of like grade and quality and identical brand, where the
12 effect of such discrimination may be to substantially lessen
13 competition, tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce, or
14 injure, destroy or prevent competition with any dealer who either
15 grants or knowingly receives the benefit of such discrimination;
16 provided, however, different prices may be charged if:
17 a. such differences are due to differences in the cost of
18 manufacture, sale or delivery of the equipment or
19 repair parts,
20 b. the supplier can show that its lower price was made in
21 good faith to meet an equally low price of a
22 competitor, or
23
24
Req. No. 1703 Page 12

1 c. such differences are related to the volume of
2 equipment purchased by dealers or market share
3 obtained by dealers;
4 7. To prevent by contract or otherwise, any dealer from
5 changing its capital structure or the means by or through which the
6 dealer finances its operations, so long as the dealer gives prior
7 notice to the supplier, and provided the dealer at all times meets
8 any reasonable capital standards required by the supplier pursuant
9 to a right granted in the dealer agreement and imposed on similarly
10 situated dealers; and
11 8. To require a dealer to assent to a release, assignment,
12 novation, waiver, or estoppel which would relieve any person from
13 liability imposed by this act the Fair Practices of Equipment
14 Manufacturers, Distributors, Wholesalers and Dealers Act.

21 Equipment Manufacturers, Distributors, Wholesalers and Dealers Act,
22 “good cause” means the failure by a dealer to substantially comply
23 with essential and reasonable requirements imposed upon the dealer
24 by the dealer agreement, provided such requirements are not
Req. No. 1703 Page 13

1 diff erent from those requirements imposed on other similarly
2 situated dealers either by their terms or in the manner of their
3 enforcement. In addition, good cause shall exist whenever:
4 1. The dealer or dealership has transferred a controlling
5 ownership interest in its business without the supplier’s consent
6 unless the supplier does not have the right to withhold consent
7 under either the dealer agreement or under the terms of this act;
8 2. The dealer has filed a voluntary petition in bankruptcy or
9 has had an involuntary petition in bankruptcy filed against it which
10 has not been discharged within thirty (30) days after the filing, or
11 there has been a closeout or sale of a substantial part of the
12 dealer’s assets related to the business, or there has been a
13 commencement of dissolution or liquidation of the dealer;
14 3. There has been a deletion, addition or change in dealer or
15 dealership locations without the prior written approval of the
16 supplier;
17 4. The dealer has defaulted under any chattel mortgage or other
18 security agreement between the dealer and the supplier, or there has
19 been a revocation of any guarantee of the dealer’s present or future
20 obligations to the supplier; provided, however, good cause will not
21 exist if a person revokes any guarantee in connection with or
22 following the transfer of such person’s entire ownership interest in
23 the dealer unless the supplier requires the person to execute a new
24
Req. No. 1703 Page 14

1 guar antee of the dealer’s present or future obligations in
2 connection with the transfer of ownership interest;
3 5. The dealer has failed to operate in the normal course of

10 the representation or reputation of the supplier’s product; or
11 8. The dealer has consistently failed to meet and maintain the
12 supplier’s requirements for reasonable standards and performance
13 objectives, so long as the supplier has given the dealer reasonable
14 standards and performance objectives that are based on the
15 manufacturer’s experience in other comparable market areas.
16 B. The provisions of this section will not apply to single-line
17 dealer agreements.
18 SECTION 4. AMENDATORY 15 O.S. 2021, Section 245A.2, is
19 amended to read as follows:
20 Section 245A.2. A. Except as otherwise provided in this
21 section, a supplier must provide a dealer at least one hundred
22 eighty (180) days days’ prior written notice of termination of a
23 dealer agreement. The notice must state all reasons constituting
24 good cause for such termination and must state that the dealer has
Req. No. 1703 Page 15

1 sixt y (60) days in which to cure any claimed deficiency. If the
2 deficiency is rectified within sixty (60) days, the notice will be
3 void. A supplier, other than a specialty agricultural equipment
4 supplier, may not terminate a dealer agreement for the reason set
5 forth in paragraph 8 of subsection A of Section 5 245A.1 of this act
6 title unless the supplier gives the dealer notice of such action at
7 least two (2) years before the effective date of the action. If the
8 dealer achieves the supplier’s requirements for reasonable standards
9 or performance objectives before the expiration of the two-year
10 notice period, the notice will be void and the dealer agreement will
11 continue in full force and effect. The notice and right to cure

14 subsection A of Section 5 245A.1 of this act title.
15 B. If a supplier has contractual authority to approve or deny a
16 request for a sale or transfer of a dealer’s business or an equity
17 ownership interest therein, the supplier shall approve or deny such
18 a request within sixty (60) days after receiving a written request
19 from the dealer. If the supplier has neither approved nor denied
20 the request within the sixty-day period, the request will be deemed
21 approved. The dealer’s request shall include reasonable financial,
22 personal background, character references and work history
23 information for the acquiring persons. If a supplier denies a
24 request made pursuant to this subsection, the supplier must provide
Req. No. 1703 Page 16

1 the dealer with a written notice of the denial that states the
2 reasons for the denial. A supplier may only deny not unreasonably
3 withhold consent to a request based on the failure of the proposed
4 transferees to meet the reasonable requirements consistently imposed
5 by the supplier in determining approval of the transfer and/or
6 approvals of new dealers for a sale or transfer of a dealer’s
7 business or an equity ownership interest in such business, and such
8 consent may only be withheld for good cause. The supplier shall
9 have the burden to prove that the denial of the request for sale or
10 transfer complied with the requirements of this subsection.
11 C. If a dealer dies and the supplier has contractual authority
12 to approve or deny a request for a sale or transfer of the dealer’s
13 business or equity ownership interest therein, the dealer’s estate,
14 or such other person with authority to transfer assets of the
15 dealer, will have one hundred eighty (180) days to submit to the
16 supplier a written request for a sale or transfer of the business or
17 equity ownership interest. If the request is timely submitted, the
18 supplier shall approve or deny the request in accordance with
19 subsection B of this section. Notwithstanding anything to the
20 contrary contained in the Fair Practices of Equipment Manufacturers,
21 Distributors, Wholesalers and Dealers Act, any attempt by the
22 supplier to terminate the dealer or the dealership as a result of
23 the death of a dealer will be delayed until there has been
24
Req. No. 1703 Page 17

1 comp liance with the terms of this section or the one-hundred-eighty-
2 day period has expired, as applicable.
3 D. The provisions of this section shall not apply to single-
4 line dealer agreements.
