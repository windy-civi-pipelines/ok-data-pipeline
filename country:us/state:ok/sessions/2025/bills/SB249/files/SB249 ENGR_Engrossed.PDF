16 Section 2397. A. Upon receiving notification from the
17 Executive Director of the Oklahoma Department of Commerce that an
18 approved company has entered into a tourism project agreement and is
19 entitled to the inducements provided by the Oklahoma Tourism
20 Development Act, the Oklahoma Tax Commission shall provide the
21 approved company with forms and instructions as necessary to claim
22 or receive or pass-through those inducements.
23 B. An approved company whose agreement provides that it shall
24 expend approved costs of more than Five Hundred Thousand Dollars
ENGR. S. B. NO. 249 Page 1
1 ($50 0,000.00) for a tourism attraction project but less than One
2 Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) shall be entitled to a sales tax
3 credit if the company certifies to the Tax Commission that it has
4 expended at least the minimum amount in approved costs, and the
5 Executive Director certifies that the approved company is in
6 compliance with the Oklahoma Tourism Development Act. The Tax
7 Commission shall then issue a tax credit memorandum to the approved
8 company granting a sales tax credit in the amount of up to ten
9 percent (10%) of the approved costs, but limited to the percent of
10 the approved costs that will result in the project being revenue-
11 neutral to this state as determined by the Oklahoma Department of
12 Commerce. Subsequent requests for credit for additional certified
13 approved costs in excess of the minimum amount for each project as
14 listed in this subsection but less than One Million Dollars
15 ($1,000,000.00) shall result in a sales tax credit in the amount of
16 up to ten percent (10%) of the approved costs, but limited to the
17 percent of the approved costs that will result in the project being
18 revenue-neutral to this state as determined by the Oklahoma
19 Department of Commerce. Sales tax credits allowed pursuant to the
20 provisions of the Oklahoma Tourism Development Act shall not be
21 transferable or assignable; provided that, with respect to a tourism
22 attraction project that is an Entertainment District, the approved
23 company can elect to pass-through all or a portion of the sales tax
24 credit to one or more Entertainment District Tenant Parties. The
ENGR. S. B. NO. 249 Page 2
1 appr oved company and the Entertainment District Tenant Party shall
2 jointly file a copy of the written credit pass-through agreement
3 with the Oklahoma Tax Commission within thirty (30) days of the
4 effective date of the agreement. Such filing of the agreement with
5 the Oklahoma Tax Commission shall perfect such agreement. The
6 written agreement shall contain the name, address and taxpayer
7 identification number of the parties to the agreement, the amount of
8 credit being passed-through, the month and year the credit was
9 originally allowed to the approved company, the month and tax year
10 or years for which the credit may be claimed, and a representation
11 by the approved company that the approved company has neither
12 claimed for its own behalf nor conveyed such credits to any other
13 Entertainment District Tenant Party. The Tax Commission shall
14 develop a standard form for use by an approved company and an
15 Entertainment District Tenant Party demonstrating eligibility for
16 the Entertainment District Tenant Party to utilize the sales tax
17 credit. The Tax Commission shall develop a system to record and
18 track the pass-through of the sales tax credit and certify the
19 ownership of the sales tax credit and may promulgate rules to permit
20 verification of the validity and timeliness of a sales tax credit
21 claimed upon a sales tax return pursuant to this subsection but
22 shall not promulgate any rules which unduly restrict or hinder the
23 pass-through of such sales tax credit to an Entertainment District
24 Tenant Party.

5 least One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) in approved costs and the
6 Executive Director certifies that the approved company is in
7 compliance with the Oklahoma Tourism Development Act. The Tax
8 Commission shall then issue a tax credit memorandum to the approved
9 company granting a sales tax credit in the amount of up to twenty-
10 five percent (25%) of the approved costs, but limited to the percent
11 of the approved costs that will result in the project being revenue-
12 neutral to this state as determined by the Oklahoma Department of
13 Commerce. The credit on all subsequent additional certified
14 approved costs shall be in the amount of up to twenty-five percent
15 (25%) of the costs, but limited to the percent of the approved costs
16 that will result in the project being revenue-neutral to this state
17 as determined by the Oklahoma Department of Commerce. For a tourism
18 attraction project that is an Entertainment District, an approved
19 company may elect to receive an incentive payment based on sales tax
20 collections of Entertainment District Tenant Parties rather than a
21 sales tax credit. The incentive payment shall be in the amount of
22 up to twenty-five percent (25%) of the approved costs but limited to
23 the percent of the approved costs that will result in the project
24 being revenue-neutral to this state as determined by the Oklahoma

6 of the incentive payment amount during each calendar year. The Tax

10 (25%) of the approved costs but limited to the percent of the
11 approved costs that will result in the project being revenue-neutral
12 to this state as determined by the Oklahoma Department of Commerce.
13 As soon as practicable after the end of each calendar year during
14 the term of the agreement, the approved company shall file a claim
15 for the incentive payment with the Tax Commission, and the Tax
16 Commission shall be responsible for ensuring that the amount of the
17 incentive payment claimed does not exceed the increased state sales
18 tax liability of the approved company and the Entertainment District
19 Tenant Parties that has been actually received by the Tax
20 Commission, which may include accessing the Oklahoma sales tax
21 returns of the Entertainment District Tenant Parties as permitted by
22 this section.

15 authorize inducements for approved costs expended up to five (5)
16 years from the date the agreement was signed if the Executive
17 Director determines that the failure to complete the tourism

22 originally planned, which will be more than three (3) years from the
