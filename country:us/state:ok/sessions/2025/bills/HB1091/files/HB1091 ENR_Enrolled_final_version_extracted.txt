of out-of-pocket expenses. Only salary on which the required

401(a)(17)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The
annual salary limit in effect for a calendar year applies to any
period, not exceeding twelve (12) months, over which salary is
determined ("determination period") beginning in such calendar year.
If a determination period consists of fewer than twelve (12) months,
the EGTRRA salary limit will be multiplied by a fraction, the

absent a severance from employment, would have been paid to the
firefighter while the firefighter continued in employment with the
participating municipality.

not be considered gross salary if paid after severance from
employment, even if they are paid by the later of two and one-half
(2 1/2) months after the date of severance from employment or the
end of the calendar year that includes the date of severance from
employment, except payments to an individual who does not currently
perform services for the participating municipality by reason of
qualified military service within the meaning of Section 414(u)(5)
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, to the extent
these payments do not exceed the amounts the individual would have
received if the individual had continued to perform services for the
participating municipality rather than entering qualified military
service.
Effective June 9, 2010, back pay, within the meaning of Section

Section 24:
1.415(c)-2(g)(8) of the Income Tax Regulations, shall be treated as

private school or any institution of higher education. Any child
adopted by a member after the member's retirement shall be a
beneficiary only if the child is adopted by the member for the
thirty (30) continuous months preceding the member's death. Any

whose spouse does not meet the qualifications of beneficiary who has
one or more children, said child or children shall receive pension

benefit of said child, or if there is no trust, to the child's or
children's legally appointed guardian, the pension benefits as

Section 53:
SECTION 4. AMENDATORY 11 O.S. 2021, Section 49-117.3, is
amended to read as follows:

Section 54:
Section 49-117.3. A. The State Board shall adopt rules or
procedures for computation of the purchase price for transferred
credited service. These rules or procedures shall base the purchase
price for each year purchased on the actuarial cost of the
incremental projected benefits to be purchased. The purchase price
shall represent the present value of the incremental projected
benefits discounted according to the member's age at the time of
purchase. Incremental projected benefits shall be the difference
between the projected benefit said member would receive without
purchasing the transferred credited service and the projected
benefit after purchase of the transferred credited service computed
as of the earliest age at which the member would be able to retire.
Said computation shall assume an unreduced benefit and be computed
using interest and mortality assumptions consistent with the
actuarial assumptions adopted by the Board of Trustees for purposes
of preparing the annual actuarial evaluation.
B. In the event that the member is unable to pay the purchase
price provided for in this section by the due date, the State Board
shall permit the members to amortize the purchase price over a
period not to exceed sixty (60) months. Said payments shall be made
by payroll deductions unless the State Board permits an alternate
payment source. The amortization shall include interest in an
amount not to exceed the actuarially assumed interest rate adopted

unless discharged from such active duty for a service-connected
disability, and provided that the burden of proof of military
service during this period shall be with the member, who must
present appropriate documentation establishing such service.

SECTION 7. NEW LAW A new section of law to be codified
in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 49-138.1 of Title 11, unless

A. The State Board shall adopt rules or procedures for
computation of the purchase price for prior military service credit
provided for in subsection E of Section 49-138 of Title 11 of the
Oklahoma Statutes. These rules or procedures shall base the
purchase price for each year purchased on the actuarial cost of the
incremental projected benefits to be purchased. The purchase price
shall represent the present value of the incremental projected
benefits discounted according to the member's age at the time of
purchase. Incremental projected benefits shall be the difference
between the projected benefit said member would receive without
purchasing the prior military service credit and the projected
benefit after purchase of the prior military service credit computed
as of the earliest age at which the member would be able to retire.
Said computation shall assume an unreduced benefit and be computed
using interest and mortality assumptions consistent with the
ENR. H. B. NO. 1091 Page 20
RBH No. 13157
actuarial assumptions adopted by the Board of Trustees for purposes
of preparing the annual actuarial evaluation.
B. A member wishing to purchase prior military service credit

as to establish an adequate salary history for the computation of
the purchase price of prior military service credit. Upon

credit, the State Board shall provide the member with a computation
of the purchase price for prior military service credit. The
computed purchase price shall be good for ninety (90) days from the
date the computed purchase price is provided to the member and,
except as otherwise provided in subsection G of this section, must
be paid within such ninety-day period. After the expiration of the
ninety-day period without payment by the member, or payment
commencing as provided in subsection G of this section, the member
must reapply to purchase prior military service credit, a new
purchase price must be computed and provided to the member by the
State Board, and a new ninety-day period shall commence.
C. An active volunteer member may request to purchase volunteer
prior military service credit in accordance with the second, third,
and fourth sentences of subsection B of this section. A volunteer
member who purchases volunteer prior military service credit and
later becomes a paid member may purchase paid prior military service
credit in accordance with all of subsection B of this section,
including the requirement that the member be an active paid member
for a minimum of thirty (30) months so as to establish an adequate
salary history for the computation of the purchase price of prior
military service credit. Any amount paid to purchase volunteer
prior military service credit, excluding interest, shall reduce the
purchase price for the paid prior military service credit, and the
purchased volunteer prior military service credit shall be
disregarded.
D. Purchased prior military service credit shall be taken into
account only if payment is received prior to the commencement of
benefits, except as otherwise provided in subsection G of this

Section 77:
section.
E. Members who pay the purchase price in cash by the due date
described in subsection B of this section may make payment by:

Section 49-100.1), is amended to read as follows:
Section 49-100.1. As used in this article:

shall represent the present value of the incremental projected
benefits discounted according to the member's age at the time of

paid, unless said member or beneficiary affirmatively waives the
additional six-month period in which to pay the unpaid balance. The

implement the provisions of this subsection A member wishing to
purchase transferred credited service from another retirement system

State Board shall provide the member with a computation of the
purchase price for transferred credited service. The computed
purchase price shall be good for ninety (90) days from the date the
computed purchase price is provided to the member and, except as
otherwise provided in subsection F of this section, must be paid
within such ninety-day period. After the expiration of the ninety-
day period without payment by the member, or payment commencing as
provided in subsection F of this section, the member must reapply to

403(b) annuity or custodial account, an eligible deferred
compensation plan described in Code Section 457(b) which is
maintained by an eligible employer described in Code Section
457(e)(1)(A), a Code Section 401(a) qualified plan, and/or a Code

amended by Section 2, Chapter 247, O.S.L. 2024 (11 O.S. Supp. 2024,

Section 49-138. A. Any member of a regularly constituted fire
department of any municipality who is now serving or may hereafter
serve in the Armed Forces of the United States whether such service
is voluntary or involuntary, who shall have been a member of such
fire department at the time of entering such service, shall be
entitled to have the whole of the time of such service applied under
the provisions of Section 49-106 of this title, so far as the same
applies to a service pension; provided further, that the
municipality shall continue its payment into said pension fund, to
the same force and effect as though the member were in the actual
service of such fire department; provided, that any person who is
eligible for such service but who shall have volunteered for
military or naval service for a period not to exceed five (5) years
shall likewise be entitled to all of the benefits of Sections 49-138
through 49-142 of this title for the full period of such service or
enlistment; provided further, that only one such period of voluntary
service shall be considered hereunder. If such person shall
reenlist, unless required to do so by law, such person shall not
thereafter be entitled to the provisions of this subsection. The
provisions of this subsection shall not apply where any such person
dies during the period of said service or enlistment, and shall not
entitle the surviving spouse or children to any benefits, and shall

B. Effective February 1, 1997, credited service received
pursuant to this section or credited service for wartime military
service received as otherwise provided by law shall be used in
determining the member's retirement benefit but shall not be used in
determining years of service for retirement, vesting purposes or
eligibility for participation in the Oklahoma Firefighters Deferred
Option Plan. For a member of the System hired on or after July 1,
2003, if the military service credit authorized by this section is
used to compute the retirement benefit of the member and the member
retires from the System, such military service credit shall not be
used to compute the retirement benefit in any other retirement
system created pursuant to the Oklahoma Statutes and the member may
receive credit for such service only in the retirement system from
which the member first retires.
C. A member who retires or elects to participate in the
Oklahoma Firefighters Deferred Option Plan on or after July 1, 1998,
shall be entitled to prior service credit, not to exceed five (5)
years, for those periods of military service on active duty prior to
membership in the Oklahoma Firefighters Pension and Retirement
System.
For purposes of this subsection, "military service" means

period, and
(2) for purposes of determining eligibility for
education and training benefits, such period
shall end on December 31, 1976, or
f. August 1, 1990, to December 31, 1991, commonly
referred to as the Gulf War, the Persian Gulf War, or
Operation Desert Storm, but excluding any person who
served on active duty for training only, unless
discharged from such active duty for a service-
connected disability;
2. During a period of war or combat military operation other
than a conflict, war or era listed in paragraph 1 of this
subsection, beginning on the date of Congressional authorization,
Congressional resolution, or Executive Order of the President of the
United States, for the use of the Armed Forces of the United States
in a war or combat military operation, if such war or combat
military operation lasted for a period of ninety (90) days or more,
for a person who served, and only for the period served, in the area
of responsibility of the war or combat military operation, but
excluding a person who served on active duty for training only,
unless discharged from such active duty for a service-connected
disability, and provided that the burden of proof of military
service during this period shall be with the member, who must
present appropriate documentation establishing such service.
D. An eligible member pursuant to subsection C of this section
shall include only those persons who shall have served during the
times or in the areas prescribed in subsection C of this section,
and only if such person provides appropriate documentation in such
time and manner as required by the System to establish such military
service prescribed in this section, or for service pursuant to

credit pursuant to subsections B through D of this section may
purchase up to five (5) years of full-time active duty military
prior service credit at the actuarial cost of service credit as
determined by the Oklahoma Firefighters Pension and Retirement
System Board, pursuant to Section 49-117.3 Section 7 of this title
act.
The service credit provided by this subsection shall be
administered pursuant to subsections B through D of this section,
including, but not limited to, only full-time active duty military
service not for training-only purposes, unless discharged from
active duty for a service-connected disability, as reflected on the
member's Defense Department Form 214, shall be considered for prior
service credit, and such prior service credit shall only be used in
determining the member's retirement benefit but shall not be used in
determining years of service for retirement, vesting purposes, or
eligibility for participation in the Oklahoma Firefighters Deferred
Option Plan.
F. Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary:
1. Contributions, benefits and service credit with respect to
qualified military service shall be provided in accordance with
Section 414(u) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,
which is in accordance with the Uniformed Services Employment and

the member are entitled to any additional benefits (other than
benefits accruals relating to the period of qualified military
ENR. H. B. NO. 1091 Page 19

service) provided under the System had the member resumed and then
terminated employment on account of death.
G. Members or beneficiaries shall make application to the
System for credited service related to wartime military service.
Interest on additional benefits related to wartime military service
owed by the System to a retired member or beneficiary as provided by
law shall cease accruing one (1) year after the effective date the
additional benefits are payable by the System or July 1, 2000,
whichever is later, if the member has not applied to the System for
credited service related to such wartime military service.
H. The purchase of prior military service credit pursuant to
subsections B, C, D, and G shall not, in the aggregate, exceed five
(5) years of service credit.
SECTION 6. NEW LAW A new section of law to be codified
in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 49-117.4 of Title 11, unless
there is created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:
Notwithstanding any other provision in Section 49-100.1 et seq.
of Title 11 of the Oklahoma Statutes, the maximum number of years of
credited service taken into account under the System shall not
exceed thirty (30) years.
SECTION 7. NEW LAW A new section of law to be codified
in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 49-138.1 of Title 11, unless
there is created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:
A. The State Board shall adopt rules or procedures for
computation of the purchase price for prior military service credit
provided for in subsection E of Section 49-138 of Title 11 of the
Oklahoma Statutes. These rules or procedures shall base the
purchase price for each year purchased on the actuarial cost of the
incremental projected benefits to be purchased. The purchase price
shall represent the present value of the incremental projected
benefits discounted according to the member's age at the time of
purchase. Incremental projected benefits shall be the difference
between the projected benefit said member would receive without
purchasing the prior military service credit and the projected
benefit after purchase of the prior military service credit computed
as of the earliest age at which the member would be able to retire.
Said computation shall assume an unreduced benefit and be computed
using interest and mortality assumptions consistent with the
ENR. H. B. NO. 1091 Page 20

RBH No. 13157
actuarial assumptions adopted by the Board of Trustees for purposes
of preparing the annual actuarial evaluation.
B. A member wishing to purchase prior military service credit
must be an active paid member for a minimum of thirty (30) months so
as to establish an adequate salary history for the computation of
the purchase price of prior military service credit. Upon
application by an eligible member to purchase prior military service
credit, the State Board shall provide the member with a computation
of the purchase price for prior military service credit. The
computed purchase price shall be good for ninety (90) days from the
date the computed purchase price is provided to the member and,
except as otherwise provided in subsection G of this section, must
be paid within such ninety-day period. After the expiration of the
ninety-day period without payment by the member, or payment
commencing as provided in subsection G of this section, the member
must reapply to purchase prior military service credit, a new
purchase price must be computed and provided to the member by the
State Board, and a new ninety-day period shall commence.
C. An active volunteer member may request to purchase volunteer
prior military service credit in accordance with the second, third,
and fourth sentences of subsection B of this section. A volunteer
member who purchases volunteer prior military service credit and
later becomes a paid member may purchase paid prior military service
credit in accordance with all of subsection B of this section,
including the requirement that the member be an active paid member
for a minimum of thirty (30) months so as to establish an adequate
salary history for the computation of the purchase price of prior
military service credit. Any amount paid to purchase volunteer
prior military service credit, excluding interest, shall reduce the
purchase price for the paid prior military service credit, and the
purchased volunteer prior military service credit shall be
disregarded.
D. Purchased prior military service credit shall be taken into
account only if payment is received prior to the commencement of
benefits, except as otherwise provided in subsection G of this
section.
E. Members who pay the purchase price in cash by the due date
described in subsection B of this section may make payment by:
1. A trustee-to-trustee transfer of non-Roth funds from a Code
Section 403(b) annuity or custodial account, an eligible deferred
ENR. H. B. NO. 1091 Page 21

RBH No. 13157
compensation plan described in Code Section 457(b) which is
maintained by an eligible employer described in Code Section
457(e)(1)(A), and/or a Code Section 401(a) qualified plan, provided
that after-tax funds in retirement plans shall not be used to
purchase military service credit;
2. A direct rollover of tax-deferred funds from a Code Section
403(b) annuity or custodial account, an eligible deferred
compensation plan described in Code Section 457(b) which is
maintained by an eligible employer described in Code Section
457(e)(1)(A), a Code Section 401(a) qualified plan, and/or a Code
Section 408(a) or 408(b) traditional or conduit Individual
Retirement Account or Annuity (IRA), provided that Roth accounts,
after-tax funds in retirement plans or IRAs, and Coverdell Education
Savings Accounts shall not be used to purchase military service
credit; or
3. Certified check.
A combination of payment methods described in paragraphs 1 through 3
of this subsection may be used.
F. Members amortizing the purchase price and making amortized
payments by payroll deduction on an after-tax basis, as described in
subsection G of this section, shall have the option of making a cash
payment for the balance of the actuarial purchase price with
interest due through the date of payment by:
1. A trustee-to-trustee transfer of non-Roth funds from a Code
Section 403(b) annuity or custodial account, an eligible deferred
compensation plan described in Code Section 457(b) which is
maintained by an eligible employer described in Code Section
457(e)(1)(A), and/or a Code Section 401(a) qualified plan, provided
that after-tax funds in retirement plans shall not be used to
purchase military service credit;
2. A direct rollover of tax-deferred funds from a Code Section
403(b) annuity or custodial account, an eligible deferred
compensation plan described in Code Section 457(b) which is
maintained by an eligible employer described in Code Section
457(e)(1)(A), a Code Section 401(a) qualified plan, and a Code
Section 408(a) or 408(b) traditional or conduit Individual
Retirement Account or Annuity (IRA), provided that Roth accounts,
after-tax funds in retirement plans and IRAs, and Coverdell
ENR. H. B. NO. 1091 Page 22

RBH No. 13157
Education Savings Accounts shall not be used to purchase military
service credit; or
3. Certified check.
A combination of payment methods described in paragraphs 1 through 3
of this subsection may be used.
G. In the event that the member does not pay the purchase price
provided for in this section by the due date established in
subsection B of this section as provided for in subsection E of this
section, the State Board may permit the member to amortize the
purchase price over a period not to exceed sixty (60) months or
other method approved by the State Board. Such amortized payments
shall be made by payroll deductions on an after-tax basis and shall
not be picked up by the member's employer. The amortized payments
shall include interest at a rate not to exceed the actuarially
assumed interest rate adopted by the State Board for investment
earnings each year. Any member who ceases to make payment,
terminates, retires, or dies before completing the payments provided
for in this section shall receive prior military service credit
prorated for only those payments made, not including interest,
unless the unpaid balance, including interest, is paid by the
member, the member's surviving spouse, the member's beneficiary, or
the member's estate or successor in interest within ninety (90) days
of the first to occur of said member's termination, retirement, or
death; provided that no retirement benefits shall be payable until
the earliest of the date the unpaid balance is paid in full or
ninety (90) days after the first to occur of the member's
termination, retirement, or death.
H. The State Board shall promulgate such rules or procedures as
are necessary to implement the provisions of this section.
SECTION 8. It being immediately necessary for the preservation
of the public peace, health or safety, an emergency is hereby
declared to exist, by reason whereof this act shall take effect and
be in full force from and after its passage and approval.
