12 credited service. These rules or procedures shall base the purchase
13 price for each year purchased on the actuarial cost of the
14 incremental projected benefits to be purchased. The purchase price
15 shall represent the present value of the incremental projected
16 benefits discounted according to the member's age at the time of
17 purchase. Incremental projected benefits shall be the difference
18 between the projected benefit said member would receive without
19 purchasing the transferred credited service and the projected
20 benefit after purchase of the transferred credited service computed
21 as of the earliest age at which the member would be able to retire.
22 Said computation shall assume an unreduced benefit and be computed
23 using interest and mortality assumptions consistent with the

13 prorated service credit for only those payments made, unless the
14 unpaid balance is paid by said member, his or her estate or
15 successor in interest within six (6) months after said member's
16 death, termination of employment or retirement, provided no
17 retirement benefits shall be payable until the unpaid balance is
18 paid, unless said member or beneficiary affirmatively waives the
19 additional six-month period in which to pay the unpaid balance. The

21 implement the provisions of this subsection A member wishing to
22 purchase transferred credited service from another retirement system
