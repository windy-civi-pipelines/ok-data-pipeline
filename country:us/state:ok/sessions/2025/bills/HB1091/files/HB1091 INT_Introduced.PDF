11 benefits discounted according to the member's age at the time of
12 purchase. Incremental projected benefits shall be the difference
13 between the projected benefit said member would receive without
14 purchasing the transferred credited service and the projected
15 benefit after purchase of the transferred credited service computed
16 as of the earliest age at which the member would be able to retire.
17 Said computation shall assume an unreduced benefit and be computed
18 using interest and mortality assumptions consistent with the

22 price provided for in this section by the due date, the State Board

7 prorated service credit for only those payments made, unless the
8 unpaid balance is paid by said member, his or her estate or

19 to establish an adequate salary history for the computation of the
20 purchase price of transferred credited service. Upon application by
21 an eligible member to purchase transferred credited service, the
22 State Board shall provide the member with a computation of the
23 purchase price for transferred credited service. The computed
24 purchase price shall be good for ninety (90) days from the date the

Re: RBH No. 10625 Oklahoma Firefighter Pension and Retirement System
RBH No. 10625 contains clarification of the definition of
contributions.
It excludes (1) payments to repurchase credited service; (2)
payments made to transfer credited service from another retirement
system; and (3) payments made to purchase prior military service.
Minimum death benefit is defined as return of accumulated
contributions plus (1), (2) and (3) above.
RBH No. 10625 is a non fiscal bill as defined by OPLAAA.
