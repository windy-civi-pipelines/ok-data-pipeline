Req. No. 299 Page 1

care, support and education of the children;
2
3

Section 5:
2. Unless not in the best interests of the children, may
3
4
provide for the visitation of the noncustodial parent with any of
4
5
the children of the noncustodial parent; and
5
6

Section 6:
3. May modify or change any order whenever circumstances render
6
7
the change proper either before or after final judgment in the
7
8
action; provided, that the amount of the periodic child support
8
9

9
10

10
11
the obligor and obligee, or if the obligee has assigned child
11
12
support rights to the Department of Human Services or other entity,
12
13
by agreement of the Department or other entity. Unless the parties
13
14
agree to the contrary, a completed child support computation form
14
15
provided for in Section 120 of this title shall be required to be
15
16
filed with the child support order.
16
17
The social security numbers of both parents and the child shall
17
18
be included on the child support order summary form provided for in
18
19

Section 7:
Section 120 of this title, which shall be submitted to the Central
19
20
Case Registry as provided for in Section 112A of this title with all
20
21
child support or paternity orders.
21
22
B. In any action in which there are minor unmarried children in
22
23
awarding or modifying the custody of the child or in appointing a
23
24
general guardian for the child, the court shall be guided by the
24
Req. No. 299 Page 2
1
provisions of Section 112.5 of this title and shall consider what
1
2
appears to be in the best interests of the child.
2
3
C. In awarding or modifying custody or visitation of a child,
3
4
if a party to the action alleges that the other party has committed
4
5
an act of child abuse against the child, or committed an act of
5
6
domestic violence against the party making the allegation or a
6
7
family or household member of either party, the court shall, before
7
8
considering any other best interest factors, hear and determine upon
8
9
competent admissible evidence the allegations set forth and enter
9
10
findings regarding any child abuse or domestic violence. The
10
11
evidentiary hearing for such determination shall be held within
11
12
sixty (60) days of the filing of a verified pleading; provided,
12
13
however, the court may issue any necessary emergency orders to
13
14
protect the child. If a parent makes a good-faith allegation based
14
15
on a reasonable belief supported by facts that the child is the
15
16
victim of child abuse or the effects of domestic violence, and if
16
17
that parent acts lawfully and in good faith in response to that
17
18
reasonable belief to protect the child or seek treatment for the
18
19
child, then that parent shall not be deprived of custody,
19
20
visitation, or contact with the child, or restricted in custody,
20
21
visitation, or contact, based solely on that belief or the
21
22
reasonable actions taken based on that belief. If the court finds a
22
23
pattern of child abuse or domestic violence by a parent, the court
23
24
shall award sole custody of the child to the non-offending parent or
24
Req. No. 299 Page 3
1
party and shall suspend visitation or award only supervised
1
2
visitation to the parent engaged in a pattern of abusive or violent
2
3
behavior. If the court finds that a party has not engaged in a
3
4
pattern of child abuse or domestic violence, the court may not
4
5
refuse to consider additional evidence of child abuse or domestic
5
6
violence presented later in the case. Upon a finding that a parent
6
7
has committed child abuse or domestic violence, the court may order
7
8
payment by the offending parent of court costs and fees including,
8
9
but not limited to, attorney and expert fees that are incurred by
9
10
the non-offending parent to prepare for and participate in the
10
11
evidentiary hearing.
11
12
D. 1. When it is in the best interests of a minor unmarried
12
13
child, the court shall:
13
14
a. assure children of frequent and continuing contact
14
15
with both parents after the parents have separated or
15
16
dissolved their marriage, and
16
17
b. encourage parents to share the rights and
17
18
responsibilities of child rearing in order to effect
18
19
this policy.
19
20

Section 8:
2. There shall be neither a legal preference nor a presumption
20
21
for or against joint legal custody, joint physical custody, or sole
21
22
custody.
22
23

Section 9:
3. When in the best interests of the child, custody shall be
23
24
awarded in a way which assures the frequent and continuing contact
24
Req. No. 299 Page 4
1
of the child with both parents. When awarding custody to either
1
2
parent, the court:
2
3
a. shall consider, among other facts, which parent is
3
4
more likely to allow the child or children frequent
4
5
and continuing contact with the noncustodial parent,
5
6
and
6
7
b. shall not prefer a parent as a custodian of the child
7
8
because of the gender of that parent.
8
9

Section 10:
4. In any action, there shall be neither a legal preference or
9
10
nor a presumption for or against private or public school or home-
10
11
schooling in awarding the custody of a child, or in appointing a
11
12
general guardian for the child.
12
13

Section 11:
5. Notwithstanding any custody determination made pursuant to
13
14
the Oklahoma Children’s Code, when a parent of a child is required
14
15
to be separated from a child due to military service, the court
15
16
shall not enter a final order modifying an existing custody order
16
17
until such time as the parent has completed the term of duty
17
18
requiring separation. For purposes of this paragraph:
18
19
a. in the case of a parent who is a member of the Army,
19
20
Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps or Coast Guard, the term
20
21
“military service” means a combat deployment,
21
22
contingency operation, or natural disaster requiring
22
23
the use of orders that do not permit any family member
23
24
to accompany the member,
24
Req. No. 299 Page 5
1
b. in the case of a parent who is a member of the
1
2
National Guard, the term “military service” means
2
3
service under a call to active service authorized by
3
4
the President of the United States or the Secretary of
4
5
Defense for a period of more than thirty (30)
5
6
consecutive days under 32 U.S.C. 502(f) for purposes
6
7
of responding to a national emergency declared by the
7
8
President and supported by federal funds. “Military
8
9
service” shall include any period during which a
9
10
member is absent from duty on account of sickness,
10
11
wounds, leave or other lawful cause, and
11
12
c. the court may enter a temporary custody or visitation
12
13
order pursuant to the requirements of the Deployed
13
14
Parents Custody and Visitation Act.
14
15

Section 12:
6. In making an order for custody, the court shall require
15
16
compliance with Section 112.3 of this title.
16
17
D. E. 1. Except for good cause shown, a pattern of failure to
17
18
allow court-ordered visitation may be determined to be contrary to
18
19
the best interests of the child and as such may be grounds for
19
20
modification of the child custody order.
20
21

Section 13:
2. For any action brought pursuant to the provisions of this
21
22

Section 14:
section which the court determines to be contrary to the best
22
23
interests of the child, the prevailing party shall be entitled to
23
24
24
Req. No. 299 Page 6

recover court costs, attorney fees and any other reasonable costs

E. F. Except as otherwise provided by Section 112.1A of this
3
4
title, any child shall be entitled to support by the parents until
4
5
the child reaches eighteen (18) years of age. If a child is

program as a full-time student, the child shall be entitled to

10
11

13
14
support pursuant to this subsection after the child reaches the age
14
15
of eighteen (18) years.
15
16
F. G. In any case in which provision is made for the custody or
16
17
support of a minor child or enforcement of such order and before
17
18
hearing the matter or signing any orders, the court shall inquire
18
19
whether public assistance money or medical support has been provided
19
20
by the Department of Human Services, hereafter referred to as the
20
21
Department, for the benefit of each child. If public assistance
21
22
money, medical support, or child support services under the state
22
23
child support plan as provided in Section 237 of Title 56 of the
23
24

23
24
24
Req. No. 299 Page 1

care, support and education of the children;
2
3
2. Unless not in the best interests of the children, may
3
4
provide for the visitation of the noncustodial parent with any of
4
5
the children of the noncustodial parent; and
5
6
3. May modify or change any order whenever circumstances render
6
7
the change proper either before or after final judgment in the
7
8
action; provided, that the amount of the periodic child support
8
9
payment shall not be modified retroactively or payment of all or a
9
10
portion of the past due amount waived, except by mutual agreement of
10
11
the obligor and obligee, or if the obligee has assigned child
11
12
support rights to the Department of Human Services or other entity,
12
13
by agreement of the Department or other entity. Unless the parties
13
14
agree to the contrary, a completed child support computation form
14
15
provided for in Section 120 of this title shall be required to be
15
16
filed with the child support order.
16
17
The social security numbers of both parents and the child shall
17
18
be included on the child support order summary form provided for in

19
Section 120 of this title, which shall be submitted to the Central
19
20
Case Registry as provided for in Section 112A of this title with all
20
21
child support or paternity orders.
21
22
B. In any action in which there are minor unmarried children in
22
23
awarding or modifying the custody of the child or in appointing a
23
24
general guardian for the child, the court shall be guided by the
24
Req. No. 299 Page 2

1
provisions of Section 112.5 of this title and shall consider what

2
3
C. In awarding or modifying custody or visitation of a child,
3
4
if a party to the action alleges that the other party has committed
4
5
an act of child abuse against the child, or committed an act of
5
6
domestic violence against the party making the allegation or a
6
7
family or household member of either party, the court shall, before
7
8
considering any other best interest factors, hear and determine upon

evidentiary hearing for such determination shall be held within
11
12
sixty (60) days of the filing of a verified pleading; provided,
12
13
however, the court may issue any necessary emergency orders to
13
14
protect the child. If a parent makes a good-faith allegation based
14
15
on a reasonable belief supported by facts that the child is the
15
16
victim of child abuse or the effects of domestic violence, and if
16
17
that parent acts lawfully and in good faith in response to that
17
18
reasonable belief to protect the child or seek treatment for the
18
19
child, then that parent shall not be deprived of custody,
19
20
visitation, or contact with the child, or restricted in custody,
20
21
visitation, or contact, based solely on that belief or the
21
22
reasonable actions taken based on that belief. If the court finds a
22
23
pattern of child abuse or domestic violence by a parent, the court
23
24
shall award sole custody of the child to the non-offending parent or
24
Req. No. 299 Page 3

1
party and shall suspend visitation or award only supervised
1
2
visitation to the parent engaged in a pattern of abusive or violent
2
3
behavior. If the court finds that a party has not engaged in a
3
4
pattern of child abuse or domestic violence, the court may not
4
5
refuse to consider additional evidence of child abuse or domestic
5
6
violence presented later in the case. Upon a finding that a parent
6
7
has committed child abuse or domestic violence, the court may order
7
8
payment by the offending parent of court costs and fees including,
8
9
but not limited to, attorney and expert fees that are incurred by

10
11
evidentiary hearing.
11
12
D. 1. When it is in the best interests of a minor unmarried
12
13
child, the court shall:
13
14
a. assure children of frequent and continuing contact
14
15
with both parents after the parents have separated or
15
16
dissolved their marriage, and
16
17
b. encourage parents to share the rights and
17
18
responsibilities of child rearing in order to effect
18
19
this policy.
19
20
2. There shall be neither a legal preference nor a presumption
20
21
for or against joint legal custody, joint physical custody, or sole
21
22
custody.
22
23
3. When in the best interests of the child, custody shall be
23
24
awarded in a way which assures the frequent and continuing contact
24
Req. No. 299 Page 4

1
of the child with both parents. When awarding custody to either
1
2
parent, the court:
2
3
a. shall consider, among other facts, which parent is
3
4
more likely to allow the child or children frequent
4
5
and continuing contact with the noncustodial parent,
5
6
and
6
7
b. shall not prefer a parent as a custodian of the child
7
8
because of the gender of that parent.
8
9
4. In any action, there shall be neither a legal preference or
9
10
nor a presumption for or against private or public school or home-
10
11
schooling in awarding the custody of a child, or in appointing a
11
12
general guardian for the child.
12
13
5. Notwithstanding any custody determination made pursuant to
13
14
the Oklahoma Children’s Code, when a parent of a child is required
14
15
to be separated from a child due to military service, the court
15
16
shall not enter a final order modifying an existing custody order
16
17
until such time as the parent has completed the term of duty
17
18
requiring separation. For purposes of this paragraph:
18
19
a. in the case of a parent who is a member of the Army,
19
20
Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps or Coast Guard, the term
20
21
“military service” means a combat deployment,
21
22
contingency operation, or natural disaster requiring
22
23
the use of orders that do not permit any family member
23
24
to accompany the member,
24
Req. No. 299 Page 5

1
b. in the case of a parent who is a member of the

5
6
consecutive days under 32 U.S.C. 502(f) for purposes
6
7
of responding to a national emergency declared by the

12
13
order pursuant to the requirements of the Deployed
13
14
Parents Custody and Visitation Act.

15
6. In making an order for custody, the court shall require
15
16
compliance with Section 112.3 of this title.
16
17
D. E. 1. Except for good cause shown, a pattern of failure to
17
18
allow court-ordered visitation may be determined to be contrary to
18
19
the best interests of the child and as such may be grounds for
19
20
modification of the child custody order.
20
21
2. For any action brought pursuant to the provisions of this
21
22
section which the court determines to be contrary to the best
22
23
interests of the child, the prevailing party shall be entitled to
