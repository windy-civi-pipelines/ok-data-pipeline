7 SECTION 3. NEW LAW A new section of law not to be

9 The Legislature finds that:
10 1. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) was
11 created to provide nutritional support to low-income individuals and
12 families to reduce food insecurity;
13 2. A significant portion of SNAP funds is currently spent on
14 nonnutritive items such as soft drinks and candy, which contribute
15 to obesity, diabetes, and other chronic diseases, disproportionately
16 affecting low-income communities;
17 3. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) has
18 documented that sugar-sweetened beverages are among the most
19 commonly purchased items using SNAP benefits, undermining the
20 programâ€™s goal of promoting healthier food choices; and
21 4. Reducing the purchase of nonnutritive food items with SNAP
22 benefits will enhance public health, reduce long-term healthcare
23 costs, and align the program with its original purpose of improving
24 food security through nutritious food access.
