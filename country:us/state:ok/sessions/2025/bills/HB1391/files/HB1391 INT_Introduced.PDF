18 (50%) of the value of the partnership's assets
19 consists of intangible assets, capital or

11 within or without the state, the Oklahoma net
12 income shall, at the option of the taxpayer, be
13 that portion of the total net income of the
14 taxpayer for federal income tax purposes derived
15 from the manufacture and/or processing and sales

19 everywhere. The term "public warehouse" as used
20 in this subparagraph means a licensed public
21 warehouse, the principal business of which is

3 and 2 of this subsection, apportioned as follows:
4 (1) except as otherwise provided by division (2) of
5 this subparagraph, taxable income of an insurance
6 company for a taxable year shall be apportioned
7 to this state by multiplying such income by a
8 fraction, the numerator of which is the direct
9 premiums written for insurance on property or
10 risks in this state, and the denominator of which
11 is the direct premiums written for insurance on
12 property or risks everywhere. For purposes of

15 premiums written, assessments and annuity
16 considerations as reported for the taxable year
17 on the annual statement filed by the company with
18 the Insurance Commissioner in the form approved
19 by the National Association of Insurance
20 Commissioners, or such other form as may be
21 prescribed in lieu thereof,
22 (2) if the principal source of premiums written by an
23 insurance company consists of premiums for
24 reinsurance accepted by it, the taxable income of
Req. No. 11240 Page 8

1 such company shall be apportioned to this state
2 by multiplying such income by a fraction, the
3 numerator of which is the sum of (a) direct
4 premiums written for insurance on property or
5 risks in this state, plus (b) premiums written
6 for reinsurance accepted in respect of property
7 or risks in this state, and the denominator of
8 which is the sum of (c) direct premiums written
9 for insurance on property or risks everywhere,
10 plus (d) premiums written for reinsurance
11 accepted in respect of property or risks
12 everywhere. For purposes of this paragraph,
13 premiums written for reinsurance accepted in
14 respect of property or risks in this state,
15 whether or not otherwise determinable, may at the
16 election of the company be determined on the
17 basis of the proportion which premiums written
18 for insurance accepted from companies
19 commercially domiciled in Oklahoma bears to
20 premiums written for reinsurance accepted from
21 all sources, or alternatively in the proportion
22 which the sum of the direct premiums written for
23 insurance on property or risks in this state by
24 each ceding company from which reinsurance is
Req. No. 11240 Page 9

1 accepted bears to the sum of the total direct
2 premiums written by each such ceding company for
3 the taxable year.
4 5. The net income or loss remaining after the separate
5 allocation in paragraph 4 of this subsection, being that which is
6 derived from a unitary business enterprise, shall be apportioned to
7 this state on the basis of the arithmetical average of three factors
8 consisting of property, payroll and sales or gross revenue
9 enumerated as subparagraphs a, b and c of this paragraph. Net
10 income or loss as used in this paragraph includes that derived from
11 patent or copyright royalties, purchase discounts, and interest on
12 accounts receivable relating to or arising from a business activity,
13 the income from which is apportioned pursuant to this subsection,
14 including the sale or other disposition of such property and any
15 other property used in the unitary enterprise. Deductions used in
16 computing such net income or loss shall not include taxes based on
17 or measured by income. Provided, for corporations whose property
18 for purposes of the tax imposed by Section 2355 of this title has an
19 initial investment cost equaling or exceeding Two Hundred Million
20 Dollars ($200,000,000.00) and such investment is made on or after
21 July 1, 1997, or for corporations which expand their property or
22 facilities in this state and such expansion has an investment cost
23 equaling or exceeding Two Hundred Million Dollars ($200,000,000.00)
24 over a period not to exceed three (3) years, and such expansion is
Req. No. 11240 Page 10

1 comm enced on or after January 1, 2000, the three factors shall be
2 apportioned with property and payroll, each comprising twenty-five
3 percent (25%) of the apportionment factor and sales comprising fifty
4 percent (50%) of the apportionment factor. The apportionment
5 factors shall be computed as follows:
6 a. The property factor is a fraction, the numerator of
7 which is the average value of the taxpayer's real and
8 tangible personal property owned or rented and used in
9 this state during the tax period and the denominator
10 of which is the average value of all the taxpayer's
11 real and tangible personal property everywhere owned
12 or rented and used during the tax period.
13 (1) Property, the income from which is separately
14 allocated in paragraph 4 of this subsection,
15 shall not be included in determining this
16 fraction. The numerator of the fraction shall
17 include a portion of the investment in
18 transportation and other equipment having no
19 fixed situs, such as rolling stock, buses, trucks
20 and trailers, including machinery and equipment
21 carried thereon, airplanes, salespersons'
22 automobiles and other similar equipment, in the
23 proportion that miles traveled in Oklahoma by
24 such equipment bears to total miles traveled,
Req. No. 11240 Page 11

1 (2) Property owned by the taxpayer is valued at its
2 original cost. Property rented by the taxpayer
3 is valued at eight times the net annual rental
4 rate. Net annual rental rate is the annual
5 rental rate paid by the taxpayer, less any annual
6 rental rate received by the taxpayer from
7 subrentals,
8 (3) The average value of property shall be determined
9 by averaging the values at the beginning and
10 ending of the tax period but the Oklahoma Tax
11 Commission may require the averaging of monthly
12 values during the tax period if reasonably
13 required to reflect properly the average value of
14 the taxpayer's property;
15 b. The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of
16 which is the total compensation for services rendered
17 in the state during the tax period, and the
18 denominator of which is the total compensation for
19 services rendered everywhere during the tax period.
20 "Compensation", as used in this subsection means those
21 paid-for services to the extent related to the unitary
22 business but does not include officers' salaries,
23 wages and other compensation.

1 (1) In the case of a transportation enterprise, the
2 numerator of the fraction shall include a portion
3 of such expenditure in connection with employees
4 operating equipment over a fixed route, such as
5 railroad employees, airline pilots, or bus
6 drivers, in this state only a part of the time,
7 in the proportion that mileage traveled in
8 Oklahoma bears to total mileage traveled by such
9 employees,
10 (2) In any case the numerator of the fraction shall
11 include a portion of such expenditures in
12 connection with itinerant employees, such as
13 traveling salespersons, in this state only a part
14 of the time, in the proportion that time spent in
15 Oklahoma bears to total time spent in furtherance
16 of the enterprise by such employees;
17 c. The sales factor is a fraction, the numerator of which
18 is the total sales or gross revenue of the taxpayer in
19 this state during the tax period, and the denominator
20 of which is the total sales or gross revenue of the
21 taxpayer everywhere during the tax period. "Sales",
22 as used in this subsection does not include sales or
23 gross revenue which are separately allocated in
24 paragraph 4 of this subsection.
Req. No. 11240 Page 13

1 (1) Sales of tangible personal property have a situs
2 in this state if the property is delivered or
3 shipped to a purchaser other than the United
4 States government, within this state regardless
5 of the FOB point or other conditions of the sale;
6 or the property is shipped from an office, store,
7 warehouse, factory or other place of storage in
8 this state and (a) the purchaser is the United
9 States government or (b) the taxpayer is not
10 doing business in the state of the destination of
11 the shipment.
12 (2) In the case of a railroad or interurban railway
13 enterprise, the numerator of the fraction shall
14 not be less than the allocation of revenues to
15 this state as shown in its annual report to the
16 Corporation Commission.
17 (3) In the case of an airline, truck or bus
18 enterprise or freight car, tank car, refrigerator
19 car or other railroad equipment enterprise, the
20 numerator of the fraction shall include a portion
21 of revenue from interstate transportation in the
22 proportion that interstate mileage traveled in
23 Oklahoma bears to total interstate mileage
24 traveled.
Req. No. 11240 Page 14

1 (4) In the case of an oil, gasoline or gas pipeline
2 enterprise, the numerator of the fraction shall
3 be either the total of traffic units of the
4 enterprise within Oklahoma or the revenue
5 allocated to Oklahoma based upon miles moved, at
6 the option of the taxpayer, and the denominator
7 of which shall be the total of traffic units of
8 the enterprise or the revenue of the enterprise
9 everywhere as appropriate to the numerator. A
10 "traffic unit" is hereby defined as the
11 transportation for a distance of one (1) mile of
12 one (1) barrel of oil, one (1) gallon of gasoline
13 or one thousand (1,000) cubic feet of natural or
14 casinghead gas, as the case may be.
15 (5) In the case of a telephone or telegraph or other
16 communication enterprise, the numerator of the
17 fraction shall include that portion of the
18 interstate revenue as is allocated pursuant to
19 the accounting procedures prescribed by the
20 Federal Communications Commission; provided that
21 in respect to each corporation or business entity
22 required by the Federal Communications Commission
23 to keep its books and records in accordance with
24 a uniform system of accounts prescribed by such
Req. No. 11240 Page 15

1 Commission, the intrastate net income shall be
2 determined separately in the manner provided by
3 such uniform system of accounts and only the
4 interstate income shall be subject to allocation
5 pursuant to the provisions of this subsection.
6 Provided further, that the gross revenue factors
7 shall be those as are determined pursuant to the
8 accounting procedures prescribed by the Federal
9 Communications Commission.
10 In any case where the apportionment of the three factors
11 prescribed in this paragraph attributes to Oklahoma a portion of net
12 income of the enterprise out of all appropriate proportion to the
13 property owned and/or business transacted within this state, because
14 of the fact that one or more of the factors so prescribed are not
15 employed to any appreciable extent in furtherance of the enterprise;
16 or because one or more factors not so prescribed are employed to a
17 considerable extent in furtherance of the enterprise; or because of
18 other reasons, the Tax Commission is empowered to permit, after a
19 showing by taxpayer that an excessive portion of net income has been
20 attributed to Oklahoma, or require, when in its judgment an
21 insufficient portion of net income has been attributed to Oklahoma,
22 the elimination, substitution, or use of additional factors, or
23 reduction or increase in the weight of such prescribed factors.
24 Provided, however, that any such variance from such prescribed
Req. No. 11240 Page 16

1 fact ors which has the effect of increasing the portion of net income
2 attributable to Oklahoma must not be inherently arbitrary, and
3 application of the recomputed final apportionment to the net income
4 of the enterprise must attribute to Oklahoma only a reasonable
5 portion thereof.
6 6. For calendar years 1997 and 1998, the owner of a new or
7 expanded agricultural commodity processing facility in this state
8 may exclude from Oklahoma taxable income, or in the case of an
9 individual, the Oklahoma adjusted gross income, fifteen percent
10 (15%) of the investment by the owner in the new or expanded
11 agricultural commodity processing facility. For calendar year 1999,
12 and all subsequent years, the percentage, not to exceed fifteen
13 percent (15%), available to the owner of a new or expanded
14 agricultural commodity processing facility in this state claiming
15 the exemption shall be adjusted annually so that the total estimated
16 reduction in tax liability does not exceed One Million Dollars
17 ($1,000,000.00) annually. The Tax Commission shall promulgate rules
18 for determining the percentage of the investment which each eligible
19 taxpayer may exclude. The exclusion provided by this paragraph
20 shall be taken in the taxable year when the investment is made. In
21 the event the total reduction in tax liability authorized by this
22 paragraph exceeds One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) in any
23 calendar year, the Tax Commission shall permit any excess over One
24 Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) and shall factor such excess into
Req. No. 11240 Page 17

1 the percentage for subsequent years. Any amount of the exemption
2 permitted to be excluded pursuant to the provisions of this
3 paragraph but not used in any year may be carried forward as an
4 exemption from income pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph
5 for a period not exceeding six (6) years following the year in which
6 the investment was originally made.
7 For purposes of this paragraph:
8 a. "Agricultural commodity processing facility" means

16 include a facility that provides only, and nothing
17 more than, storage, cleaning, drying or transportation
18 of agricultural commodities, and
19 b. "Facility" means each part of the facility which is
20 used in a process primarily for:
21 (1) the processing of agricultural commodities,
22 including receiving or storing agricultural
23 commodities, or the production of milk at a dairy
24 operation,
Req. No. 11240 Page 18

9 shall be considered a net operating loss carryback in accordance
10 with and to the extent of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C.,
11 Section 172(b)(G). However, the amount of the net operating loss
12 carryback shall not exceed the lesser of:

23 to 26 U.S.C.A., Section 45A, is allowed. For purposes of this
24
Req. No. 11240 Page 19

1 para graph, "qualified wages" means those wages used to calculate the
2 federal credit pursuant to 26 U.S.C.A., Section 45A.

4 in computing its Oklahoma net entity income or loss pursuant to the
5 provisions of the Pass-Through Entity Tax Equity Act of 2019, and
6 (ii) the total amount of tax attributable to any resulting Oklahoma

13 this paragraph, the adjusted tax basis of any ownership interest in
14 a pass-through entity for purposes of Section 2351 et seq. of this
