16 map, the actual mileage via the shortest practical
17 route will apply,

19 retained until the final and full mileage is
20 determined, at which time any remaining fraction shall
21 be increased to the next whole mile,
22 c. when, due to circumstances beyond the control of the
23 wrecker or towing service, roadway conditions make it
24 impractical to travel via the shortest route, distance
