1 A. There is hereby established in the Office of the Attorney
2 General the Public Access Counselor Unit.

4 denied by a public body, except the Legislature and committees,
5 commissions, and agencies thereof, may file a request for review
6 with the Public Access Counselor not later than thirty (30) calendar
7 days after the date of the denial. The request for review shall be
8 in writing on a form prescribed by the Attorney General and signed
9 by the requester, and shall include:
10 1. A copy of the request for access to records; and
11 2. Any responses from the public body.
12 C. A person whose request to inspect or copy a public record
13 was treated by the public body as a request for a commercial purpose
14 may file a request for review with the Public Access Counselor for
15 the limited purpose of reviewing whether the public body properly
16 determined that the request was made for a commercial purpose.
17 D. A person whose request to inspect or copy a public record
18 has not been returned in a prompt or reasonable manner may file a
19 request for review with the Public Access Counselor.
20 E. No person whose request to inspect or copy a public record
21 is made for a commercial purpose may file a request for review with
22 the Public Access Counselor.
23 F. Upon receipt of a request for review, the Public Access
24 Counselor shall determine whether further action is warranted. If
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2163 Page 2
1 the Public Access Counselor determines that the alleged violation is
2 unfounded, they shall advise the requester and the public body and
3 no further action shall be undertaken. In all other cases, the
4 Public Access Counselor shall forward a copy of the request for
5 review to the public body within seven (7) business days after
6 receipt and shall specify the records or other documents that the
7 public body shall furnish to facilitate the review. Within seven

11 documents produced by a public body contain information claimed to
12 be confidential or exempt from disclosure under the Oklahoma Open
13 Records Act, the Public Access Counselor shall not further disclose
14 that information.
15 G. 1. The Attorney General shall examine the request and

20 completed its review.
21 2. Upon receipt of an advisement, the public body shall either
22 take necessary action promptly and reasonably to comply with the

24 advisement concludes that no additional response is required, the
ENGR. H. B. NO. 2163 Page 3
1 requ ester may file suit in the proper district court against the
2 public body of which the request was made.
3 3. A public body that discloses records in accordance with

7 of the Oklahoma Statutes with respect to the same denial that is the
8 subject of a pending request for review, the requester shall notify
9 the Public Access Counselor, and the Public Access Counselor shall
10 take no further action with respect to the request for review and
11 shall so notify the public body.
12 I. The Attorney General may issue advisory opinions to advise
13 public bodies regarding compliance with this act. A review may be

15 public body or its attorney, which shall contain sufficient accurate
16 facts from which a determination can be made. The Public Access
17 Counselor may request additional information from the public body in

20 request is not liable for penalties under this act if the facts upon
21 which the advice is based have been fully and fairly disclosed to
22 the Public Access Counselor.
