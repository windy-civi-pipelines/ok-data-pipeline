23 basis of the proportion which premiums written
24 for insurance accepted from companies
Req. No. 10214 Page 19
1 commercially domiciled in Oklahoma bears to
2 premiums written for reinsurance accepted from
3 all sources, or alternatively in the proportion
4 which the sum of the direct premiums written for

6 each ceding company from which reinsurance is
7 accepted bears to the sum of the total direct
8 premiums written by each such ceding company for
9 the taxable year.
10 5. The net income or loss remaining after the separate
11 allocation in paragraph 4 of this subsection, being that which is
12 derived from a unitary business enterprise, shall be apportioned to
13 this state on the basis of the arithmetical average of three factors
14 consisting of property, payroll and sales or gross revenue
15 enumerated as subparagraphs a, b and c of this paragraph. Net
16 income or loss as used in this paragraph includes that derived from
17 patent or copyright royalties, purchase discounts, and interest on
18 accounts receivable relating to or arising from a business activity,
19 the income from which is apportioned pursuant to this subsection,
20 including the sale or other disposition of such property and any
21 other property used in the unitary enterprise. Deductions used in
22 computing such net income or loss shall not include taxes based on
23 or measured by income. Provided, for corporations whose property
24 for purposes of the tax imposed by Section 2355 of this title has an
Req. No. 10214 Page 20
1 init ial investment cost equaling or exceeding Two Hundred Million
2 Dollars ($200,000,000.00) and such investment is made on or after
3 July 1, 1997, or for corporations which expand their property or
4 facilities in this state and such expansion has an investment cost
5 equaling or exceeding Two Hundred Million Dollars ($200,000,000.00)
6 over a period not to exceed three (3) years, and such expansion is
7 commenced on or after January 1, 2000, the three factors shall be
8 apportioned with property and payroll, each comprising twenty-five
9 percent (25%) of the apportionment factor and sales comprising fifty
10 percent (50%) of the apportionment factor. The apportionment
11 factors shall be computed as follows:
12 a. The property factor is a fraction, the numerator of
13 which is the average value of the taxpayer's real and
14 tangible personal property owned or rented and used in
15 this state during the tax period and the denominator
16 of which is the average value of all the taxpayer's
17 real and tangible personal property everywhere owned
18 or rented and used during the tax period.
19 (1) Property, the income from which is separately
20 allocated in paragraph 4 of this subsection,
21 shall not be included in determining this
22 fraction. The numerator of the fraction shall
23 include a portion of the investment in
24 transportation and other equipment having no
Req. No. 10214 Page 21
1 fixed situs, such as rolling stock, buses, trucks
2 and trailers, including machinery and equipment
3 carried thereon, airplanes, salespersons'
4 automobiles and other similar equipment, in the
5 proportion that miles traveled in Oklahoma by
6 such equipment bears to total miles traveled,
7 (2) Property owned by the taxpayer is valued at its
8 original cost. Property rented by the taxpayer
9 is valued at eight times the net annual rental
10 rate. Net annual rental rate is the annual
11 rental rate paid by the taxpayer, less any annual
12 rental rate received by the taxpayer from
13 subrentals,
14 (3) The average value of property shall be determined
15 by averaging the values at the beginning and
16 ending of the tax period but the Oklahoma Tax
17 Commission may require the averaging of monthly
18 values during the tax period if reasonably
19 required to reflect properly the average value of
20 the taxpayer's property;
21 b. The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of
22 which is the total compensation for services rendered
23 in the state during the tax period, and the
24 denominator of which is the total compensation for
Req. No. 10214 Page 22
1 services rendered everywhere during the tax period.
2 "Compensation", as used in this subsection means those
3 paid-for services to the extent related to the unitary
4 business but does not include officers' salaries,
5 wages and other compensation.
6 (1) In the case of a transportation enterprise, the
7 numerator of the fraction shall include a portion
8 of such expenditure in connection with employees
9 operating equipment over a fixed route, such as
10 railroad employees, airline pilots, or bus
11 drivers, in this state only a part of the time,
12 in the proportion that mileage traveled in
13 Oklahoma bears to total mileage traveled by such
14 employees,
15 (2) In any case the numerator of the fraction shall
16 include a portion of such expenditures in
17 connection with itinerant employees, such as
18 traveling salespersons, in this state only a part
19 of the time, in the proportion that time spent in
20 Oklahoma bears to total time spent in furtherance
21 of the enterprise by such employees;
22 c. The sales factor is a fraction, the numerator of which
23 is the total sales or gross revenue of the taxpayer in
24 this state during the tax period, and the denominator
Req. No. 10214 Page 23
1 of which is the total sales or gross revenue of the
2 taxpayer everywhere during the tax period. "Sales",
3 as used in this subsection does not include sales or
4 gross revenue which are separately allocated in
5 paragraph 4 of this subsection.
6 (1) Sales of tangible personal property have a situs
7 in this state if the property is delivered or
8 shipped to a purchaser other than the United
9 States government, within this state regardless
10 of the FOB point or other conditions of the sale;
11 or the property is shipped from an office, store,
12 warehouse, factory or other place of storage in
13 this state and (a) the purchaser is the United
14 States government or (b) the taxpayer is not
15 doing business in the state of the destination of
16 the shipment.
17 (2) In the case of a railroad or interurban railway
18 enterprise, the numerator of the fraction shall
19 not be less than the allocation of revenues to
20 this state as shown in its annual report to the
21 Corporation Commission.
22 (3) In the case of an airline, truck or bus
23 enterprise or freight car, tank car, refrigerator
24 car or other railroad equipment enterprise, the
Req. No. 10214 Page 24
1 numerator of the fraction shall include a portion
2 of revenue from interstate transportation in the
3 proportion that interstate mileage traveled in
4 Oklahoma bears to total interstate mileage
5 traveled.
6 (4) In the case of an oil, gasoline or gas pipeline
7 enterprise, the numerator of the fraction shall
8 be either the total of traffic units of the
9 enterprise within Oklahoma or the revenue
10 allocated to Oklahoma based upon miles moved, at
11 the option of the taxpayer, and the denominator
12 of which shall be the total of traffic units of
13 the enterprise or the revenue of the enterprise
14 everywhere as appropriate to the numerator. A
15 "traffic unit" is hereby defined as the
16 transportation for a distance of one (1) mile of
17 one (1) barrel of oil, one (1) gallon of gasoline
18 or one thousand (1,000) cubic feet of natural or
19 casinghead gas, as the case may be.
20 (5) In the case of a telephone or telegraph or other
21 communication enterprise, the numerator of the
22 fraction shall include that portion of the
23 interstate revenue as is allocated pursuant to
24 the accounting procedures prescribed by the
Req. No. 10214 Page 25
1 Federal Communications Commission; provided that
2 in respect to each corporation or business entity
3 required by the Federal Communications Commission
4 to keep its books and records in accordance with
5 a uniform system of accounts prescribed by such
6 Commission, the intrastate net income shall be
7 determined separately in the manner provided by
8 such uniform system of accounts and only the
9 interstate income shall be subject to allocation
10 pursuant to the provisions of this subsection.
11 Provided further, that the gross revenue factors
12 shall be those as are determined pursuant to the
13 accounting procedures prescribed by the Federal
14 Communications Commission.
15 In any case where the apportionment of the three factors
16 prescribed in this paragraph attributes to Oklahoma a portion of net
17 income of the enterprise out of all appropriate proportion to the
18 property owned and/or business transacted within this state, because
19 of the fact that one or more of the factors so prescribed are not
20 employed to any appreciable extent in furtherance of the enterprise;
21 or because one or more factors not so prescribed are employed to a
22 considerable extent in furtherance of the enterprise; or because of
23 other reasons, the Tax Commission is empowered to permit, after a
24 showing by taxpayer that an excessive portion of net income has been
Req. No. 10214 Page 26
1 attr ibuted to Oklahoma, or require, when in its judgment an
2 insufficient portion of net income has been attributed to Oklahoma,
3 the elimination, substitution, or use of additional factors, or
4 reduction or increase in the weight of such prescribed factors.
5 Provided, however, that any such variance from such prescribed
6 factors which has the effect of increasing the portion of net income
7 attributable to Oklahoma must not be inherently arbitrary, and
8 application of the recomputed final apportionment to the net income
9 of the enterprise must attribute to Oklahoma only a reasonable
10 portion thereof.
11 6. For calendar years 1997 and 1998, the owner of a new or
12 expanded agricultural commodity processing facility in this state
13 may exclude from Oklahoma taxable income, or in the case of an
14 individual, the Oklahoma adjusted gross income, fifteen percent
15 (15%) of the investment by the owner in the new or expanded
16 agricultural commodity processing facility. For calendar year 1999,
17 and all subsequent years, the percentage, not to exceed fifteen
18 percent (15%), available to the owner of a new or expanded
19 agricultural commodity processing facility in this state claiming
20 the exemption shall be adjusted annually so that the total estimated
21 reduction in tax liability does not exceed One Million Dollars
22 ($1,000,000.00) annually. The Tax Commission shall promulgate rules
23 for determining the percentage of the investment which each eligible
24 taxpayer may exclude. The exclusion provided by this paragraph
Req. No. 10214 Page 27
1 shal l be taken in the taxable year when the investment is made. In
2 the event the total reduction in tax liability authorized by this
3 paragraph exceeds One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) in any
4 calendar year, the Tax Commission shall permit any excess over One
5 Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) and shall factor such excess into
6 the percentage for subsequent years. Any amount of the exemption
7 permitted to be excluded pursuant to the provisions of this
8 paragraph but not used in any year may be carried forward as an
9 exemption from income pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph
10 for a period not exceeding six (6) years following the year in which
11 the investment was originally made.
12 For purposes of this paragraph:
13 a. "Agricultural commodity processing facility" means
14 building, structures, fixtures and improvements used
15 or operated primarily for the processing or production
16 of marketable products from agricultural commodities.
17 The term shall also mean a dairy operation that
18 requires a depreciable investment of at least Two

20 produces milk from dairy cows. The term does not
21 include a facility that provides only, and nothing
22 more than, storage, cleaning, drying or transportation
23 of agricultural commodities, and
24
Req. No. 10214 Page 28
1 b. "Facility" means each part of the facility which is
2 used in a process primarily for:
3 (1) the processing of agricultural commodities,
4 including receiving or storing agricultural
5 commodities, or the production of milk at a dairy
6 operation,
7 (2) transporting the agricultural commodities or
8 product before, during or after the processing,
9 or
10 (3) packaging or otherwise preparing the product for
11 sale or shipment.
12 7. Despite any provision to the contrary in paragraph 3 of this
13 subsection, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1999, in
14 the case of a taxpayer which has a farming loss, such farming loss
15 shall be considered a net operating loss carryback in accordance
16 with and to the extent of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C.,
17 Section 172(b)(G). However, the amount of the net operating loss
18 carryback shall not exceed the lesser of:
19 a. Sixty Thousand Dollars ($60,000.00), or
20 b. the loss properly shown on Schedule F of the Internal
21 Revenue Service Form 1040 reduced by one-half (1/2) of

6 to 26 U.S.C.A., Section 45A, is allowed. For purposes of this
7 paragraph, "qualified wages" means those wages used to calculate the
8 federal credit pursuant to 26 U.S.C.A., Section 45A.
9 9. In taxable years beginning after December 31, 2005, an

10 in computing its Oklahoma net entity income or loss pursuant to the
11 provisions of the Pass-Through Entity Tax Equity Act of 2019, and
12 (ii) the total amount of tax attributable to any resulting Oklahoma
13 net entity income has been paid. The Oklahoma Tax Commission shall
14 promulgate rules for the reporting of such exclusion to direct and
15 indirect members of the electing pass-through entity. As used in
16 this paragraph, "electing pass-through entity", "indirect member",
17 and "member" shall be defined in the same manner as prescribed by
18 Section 2355.1P-2 of this title. Notwithstanding the application of
19 this paragraph, the adjusted tax basis of any ownership interest in
20 a pass-through entity for purposes of Section 2351 et seq. of this
21 title shall be equal to its adjusted tax basis for federal income
22 tax purposes.

10 in accordance with provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, 26
11 U.S.C., Section 1 et seq., in effect immediately prior to the
12 enactment of the Accelerated Cost Recovery System. The Oklahoma tax
13 basis for all such assets placed into service after December 31,
14 1981, calculated in this section shall be retained and utilized for
15 all Oklahoma income tax purposes through the final disposition of
16 such assets.
17 Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Oklahoma Income Tax
18 Act, Section 2351 et seq. of this title, or of the Internal Revenue
19 Code to the contrary, this subsection shall control calculation of
20 depreciation of assets placed into service after December 31, 1981,

16 corporation shall be allowed an exemption from taxable income of an
17 amount equal to the amount of royalty payment received as a result
18 of such transfer; provided, however, such amount shall not exceed
19 ten percent (10%) of the amount of gross proceeds received by such
20 transferor corporation as a result of the technology transfer. Such

17 the sale of an ownership interest in a publicly
18 traded partnership, as defined by Section 7704(b)

21 of such partnership's tangible property in this
22 state to the original cost of such partnership's
23 tangible property everywhere, as determined at
24 the time of the sale; if more than fifty percent
Req. No. 10214 Page 15

18 within or without the state,
19 the Oklahoma net income shall, at the option of the
20 taxpayer, be that portion of the total net income of
21 the taxpayer for federal income tax purposes derived
22 from the manufacture and/or processing and sales
23 everywhere as determined by the ratio of the sales
24 defined in this section made to the purchaser within
Req. No. 10214 Page 17

1 the state to the total sales everywhere. The term

5 e. In the case of insurance companies, Oklahoma taxable
6 income shall be taxable income of the taxpayer for

8 provided pursuant to the provisions of paragraphs 1
9 and 2 of this subsection, apportioned as follows:
10 (1) except as otherwise provided by division (2) of
11 this subparagraph, taxable income of an insurance
12 company for a taxable year shall be apportioned
13 to this state by multiplying such income by a
14 fraction, the numerator of which is the direct
15 premiums written for insurance on property or
16 risks in this state, and the denominator of which
17 is the direct premiums written for insurance on
18 property or risks everywhere. For purposes of
19 this subsection, the term "direct premiums
20 written" means the total amount of direct
21 premiums written, assessments and annuity
22 considerations as reported for the taxable year
23 on the annual statement filed by the company with
24 the Insurance Commissioner in the form approved
Req. No. 10214 Page 18

1 by the National Association of Insurance
2 Commissioners, or such other form as may be
3 prescribed in lieu thereof,
4 (2) if the principal source of premiums written by an
5 insurance company consists of premiums for
6 reinsurance accepted by it, the taxable income of
7 such company shall be apportioned to this state
8 by multiplying such income by a fraction, the
9 numerator of which is the sum of (a) direct
10 premiums written for insurance on property or
11 risks in this state, plus (b) premiums written
12 for reinsurance accepted in respect of property
13 or risks in this state, and the denominator of
14 which is the sum of (c) direct premiums written
15 for insurance on property or risks everywhere,
16 plus (d) premiums written for reinsurance
17 accepted in respect of property or risks
18 everywhere. For purposes of this paragraph,
19 premiums written for reinsurance accepted in
20 respect of property or risks in this state,
21 whether or not otherwise determinable, may at the
22 election of the company be determined on the
23 basis of the proportion which premiums written
24 for insurance accepted from companies
Req. No. 10214 Page 19

1 commercially domiciled in Oklahoma bears to
2 premiums written for reinsurance accepted from
3 all sources, or alternatively in the proportion
4 which the sum of the direct premiums written for
5 insurance on property or risks in this state by
6 each ceding company from which reinsurance is
7 accepted bears to the sum of the total direct
8 premiums written by each such ceding company for
9 the taxable year.
10 5. The net income or loss remaining after the separate
11 allocation in paragraph 4 of this subsection, being that which is
12 derived from a unitary business enterprise, shall be apportioned to
13 this state on the basis of the arithmetical average of three factors
14 consisting of property, payroll and sales or gross revenue
15 enumerated as subparagraphs a, b and c of this paragraph. Net
16 income or loss as used in this paragraph includes that derived from
17 patent or copyright royalties, purchase discounts, and interest on
18 accounts receivable relating to or arising from a business activity,
19 the income from which is apportioned pursuant to this subsection,
20 including the sale or other disposition of such property and any
21 other property used in the unitary enterprise. Deductions used in
22 computing such net income or loss shall not include taxes based on
23 or measured by income. Provided, for corporations whose property
24 for purposes of the tax imposed by Section 2355 of this title has an
Req. No. 10214 Page 20

1 init ial investment cost equaling or exceeding Two Hundred Million
2 Dollars ($200,000,000.00) and such investment is made on or after
3 July 1, 1997, or for corporations which expand their property or
4 facilities in this state and such expansion has an investment cost
5 equaling or exceeding Two Hundred Million Dollars ($200,000,000.00)
6 over a period not to exceed three (3) years, and such expansion is
7 commenced on or after January 1, 2000, the three factors shall be
8 apportioned with property and payroll, each comprising twenty-five
9 percent (25%) of the apportionment factor and sales comprising fifty
10 percent (50%) of the apportionment factor. The apportionment
11 factors shall be computed as follows:
12 a. The property factor is a fraction, the numerator of
13 which is the average value of the taxpayer's real and
14 tangible personal property owned or rented and used in
15 this state during the tax period and the denominator
16 of which is the average value of all the taxpayer's
17 real and tangible personal property everywhere owned
18 or rented and used during the tax period.
19 (1) Property, the income from which is separately
20 allocated in paragraph 4 of this subsection,
21 shall not be included in determining this
22 fraction. The numerator of the fraction shall
23 include a portion of the investment in
24 transportation and other equipment having no
Req. No. 10214 Page 21

1 fixed situs, such as rolling stock, buses, trucks
2 and trailers, including machinery and equipment
3 carried thereon, airplanes, salespersons'
4 automobiles and other similar equipment, in the
5 proportion that miles traveled in Oklahoma by
6 such equipment bears to total miles traveled,
7 (2) Property owned by the taxpayer is valued at its
8 original cost. Property rented by the taxpayer
9 is valued at eight times the net annual rental
10 rate. Net annual rental rate is the annual
11 rental rate paid by the taxpayer, less any annual
12 rental rate received by the taxpayer from
13 subrentals,
14 (3) The average value of property shall be determined
15 by averaging the values at the beginning and
16 ending of the tax period but the Oklahoma Tax
17 Commission may require the averaging of monthly
18 values during the tax period if reasonably
19 required to reflect properly the average value of
20 the taxpayer's property;
21 b. The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of
22 which is the total compensation for services rendered
23 in the state during the tax period, and the
24 denominator of which is the total compensation for
Req. No. 10214 Page 22

1 services rendered everywhere during the tax period.
2 "Compensation", as used in this subsection means those
3 paid-for services to the extent related to the unitary
4 business but does not include officers' salaries,
5 wages and other compensation.
6 (1) In the case of a transportation enterprise, the
7 numerator of the fraction shall include a portion
8 of such expenditure in connection with employees
9 operating equipment over a fixed route, such as
10 railroad employees, airline pilots, or bus
11 drivers, in this state only a part of the time,
12 in the proportion that mileage traveled in
13 Oklahoma bears to total mileage traveled by such
14 employees,
15 (2) In any case the numerator of the fraction shall
16 include a portion of such expenditures in
17 connection with itinerant employees, such as
18 traveling salespersons, in this state only a part
19 of the time, in the proportion that time spent in
20 Oklahoma bears to total time spent in furtherance
21 of the enterprise by such employees;
22 c. The sales factor is a fraction, the numerator of which
23 is the total sales or gross revenue of the taxpayer in
24 this state during the tax period, and the denominator
Req. No. 10214 Page 23

1 of which is the total sales or gross revenue of the
2 taxpayer everywhere during the tax period. "Sales",
3 as used in this subsection does not include sales or
4 gross revenue which are separately allocated in
5 paragraph 4 of this subsection.
6 (1) Sales of tangible personal property have a situs
7 in this state if the property is delivered or
8 shipped to a purchaser other than the United
9 States government, within this state regardless
10 of the FOB point or other conditions of the sale;
11 or the property is shipped from an office, store,
12 warehouse, factory or other place of storage in
13 this state and (a) the purchaser is the United
14 States government or (b) the taxpayer is not
15 doing business in the state of the destination of
16 the shipment.
17 (2) In the case of a railroad or interurban railway
18 enterprise, the numerator of the fraction shall
19 not be less than the allocation of revenues to
20 this state as shown in its annual report to the
21 Corporation Commission.
22 (3) In the case of an airline, truck or bus
23 enterprise or freight car, tank car, refrigerator
24 car or other railroad equipment enterprise, the
Req. No. 10214 Page 24

1 numerator of the fraction shall include a portion
2 of revenue from interstate transportation in the
3 proportion that interstate mileage traveled in
4 Oklahoma bears to total interstate mileage
5 traveled.
6 (4) In the case of an oil, gasoline or gas pipeline
7 enterprise, the numerator of the fraction shall
8 be either the total of traffic units of the
9 enterprise within Oklahoma or the revenue
10 allocated to Oklahoma based upon miles moved, at
11 the option of the taxpayer, and the denominator
12 of which shall be the total of traffic units of
13 the enterprise or the revenue of the enterprise
14 everywhere as appropriate to the numerator. A
15 "traffic unit" is hereby defined as the
16 transportation for a distance of one (1) mile of
17 one (1) barrel of oil, one (1) gallon of gasoline
18 or one thousand (1,000) cubic feet of natural or
19 casinghead gas, as the case may be.
20 (5) In the case of a telephone or telegraph or other
21 communication enterprise, the numerator of the
22 fraction shall include that portion of the
23 interstate revenue as is allocated pursuant to
24 the accounting procedures prescribed by the
Req. No. 10214 Page 25

1 Federal Communications Commission; provided that
2 in respect to each corporation or business entity
3 required by the Federal Communications Commission
4 to keep its books and records in accordance with
5 a uniform system of accounts prescribed by such
6 Commission, the intrastate net income shall be
7 determined separately in the manner provided by
8 such uniform system of accounts and only the
9 interstate income shall be subject to allocation
10 pursuant to the provisions of this subsection.
11 Provided further, that the gross revenue factors
12 shall be those as are determined pursuant to the
13 accounting procedures prescribed by the Federal
14 Communications Commission.
15 In any case where the apportionment of the three factors
16 prescribed in this paragraph attributes to Oklahoma a portion of net
17 income of the enterprise out of all appropriate proportion to the
18 property owned and/or business transacted within this state, because
19 of the fact that one or more of the factors so prescribed are not
20 employed to any appreciable extent in furtherance of the enterprise;
21 or because one or more factors not so prescribed are employed to a
22 considerable extent in furtherance of the enterprise; or because of
23 other reasons, the Tax Commission is empowered to permit, after a
24 showing by taxpayer that an excessive portion of net income has been
Req. No. 10214 Page 26

1 attr ibuted to Oklahoma, or require, when in its judgment an
2 insufficient portion of net income has been attributed to Oklahoma,
3 the elimination, substitution, or use of additional factors, or
4 reduction or increase in the weight of such prescribed factors.
5 Provided, however, that any such variance from such prescribed
6 factors which has the effect of increasing the portion of net income
7 attributable to Oklahoma must not be inherently arbitrary, and
8 application of the recomputed final apportionment to the net income
9 of the enterprise must attribute to Oklahoma only a reasonable
10 portion thereof.
11 6. For calendar years 1997 and 1998, the owner of a new or
12 expanded agricultural commodity processing facility in this state
13 may exclude from Oklahoma taxable income, or in the case of an
14 individual, the Oklahoma adjusted gross income, fifteen percent
15 (15%) of the investment by the owner in the new or expanded
16 agricultural commodity processing facility. For calendar year 1999,
17 and all subsequent years, the percentage, not to exceed fifteen
18 percent (15%), available to the owner of a new or expanded
19 agricultural commodity processing facility in this state claiming
20 the exemption shall be adjusted annually so that the total estimated
21 reduction in tax liability does not exceed One Million Dollars
22 ($1,000,000.00) annually. The Tax Commission shall promulgate rules
23 for determining the percentage of the investment which each eligible
24 taxpayer may exclude. The exclusion provided by this paragraph
Req. No. 10214 Page 27
