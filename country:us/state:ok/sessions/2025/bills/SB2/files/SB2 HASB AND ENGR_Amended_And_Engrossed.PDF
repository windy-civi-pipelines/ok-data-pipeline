7 SECTION 1. NEW LAW A new section of law not to be
8 codified in the Oklahoma Statutes reads as follows:
9 The Legislature finds that construction and operation of wind
10 turbines and construction of the towers used in connection with wind
11 turbines is a matter which is the proper subject of legislation.
12 The Legislature finds that the height of towers used to support
13 commercial wind turbines for production of electrical energy by
14 means of wind power is a potential issue with respect to setback
15 limitations and that there is a need for uniformity in areas of the
16 state likely to be affected by the construction and operation of
17 towers and wind turbines. The Legislature finds that consideration
18 of population density and average wind speed are a logical basis in
19 order to enact legislation related to setback requirements for the
20 structures used in the wind energy industry that pose risks related
21 to either persons or property or both in the event of damage to the
22 structures or structural failures.

3 conduct of activity which is continuous without any cessation of
4 such activity for a period in excess of sixty (60) days;
5 6. "Tip height" means the highest measurable point of a tower
6 upon which an industrial wind turbine is installed or is capable of
